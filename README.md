## Abstract
In this project, I use two different language models as feature extraction methods which are TF-IDF and word2vec. Among them, word2vec model is to learn semantic vectors of words by using an unsupervised machine learning model based on 2-layer perceptron classification machine. TF-IDF model is term frequency counting model and I will use PCA algorithm to reduce feature dimension. In order to deal with class imbalance, I use SMOTE techniques to do re-sampling. In the classification, I fine tune and compare the performance between logistic regression, linear regression, decision tree, Adaboost and Gaussian Naive Bayes. In some of this technique, I also use regularization method to do feature reduction. Finally, the evaluation is mainly use F1-macro score for overall performance comparison and F1 score for comparing the performance in each class. Following picture is model architecture.

## Installation

Install all the package according to official document. This project is developed in Jupyter-Notebook. You can install jupyter-notebook according to this [page][page]. 

## Usage example

All source codes are placed in w2v_train directory. To see all result in [EE_660_Final_Project_F19_zixiliu.pdf][pdf], download models from this page and place pickle file accordingly. To train all the model from scratch, run preprocess.ipython and then other files.
