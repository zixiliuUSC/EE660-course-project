0,just what you need for an ereader front lighting is very natural and doe not give me a headache like trying to read on backlight screen like my ipad
1,good intro tablet gb is not much space but it is a good starter for someone new to a tablet for those that cannot afford an ipad or similar this is a step down of urse but it a good introduction
2,i replaced my roku box with the fire tv a i prefer it interface
3,good tablet for the price it quick and easy to use
4,it all of a sudden ha stoped charging i have only used it a few time in the short time off purchase can i get a replacement or how best can i be helped
5,we use this everyday of the week all the option it ha make it perfect for everyone setup wa easy a is using it everyone should have one
6,i purchased this tablet because i saw that it wa at an affordable price point for me with this it is really not that bad the only thing i have found to be able a little bit annoying is that it is a little awkward to hold handle when i m playing my game the send issue i have found with this type of tablet is that it is made out of plastic it noisy the overall performance is quite impressive though good price point with good intention just a little cheap feeling a little big in the hand to hold
7,i have loved kindles from the first time i turned one on i now read about book a year that is a lot for me i finally upgraded to the paperwhite for the backlight feature i take it with me everywhere in case i have an extended wait time somewhere but i mostly use it in bed the size make it easy to hold it is a lot better then holding a cumbersome book and doe not hurt a much when i start to doze off and drop it on my face i have set the text size big enough to read without my glass get in bed turn on the backlight and read in the dark good for reading in sunlight too i only read book with my kindle so i didnsee the need to buy the fire and i only needed the wi fi version no g desired i also didnsee the need to pay more for the voyage
8,cannot beat the price awesome for kid and doe not break the bank
9,doe the job kid are kinda of rough with it holding up well
10,i m very happy with this it is easy to use and i d remmend this
11,i bought this for my daughter and she absolutely love this kindle it is a good size and the price wa right
12,it is a good product if you use amazon apps for movie and music i myself use google and cromecast so i found that the google home worked better for me
13,funny thing since steve job ha passed away techie have been waiting for the next great thing from apple and sadly it more of the same well amazon did all techie a favor with this invention something apple should have done with siri but didnhands free alexa who hears your mmand percent of the time instead of haha aka siri team this up with a smart hub like phillip lightbulb and a nest system and a harmony hub and you living like ironman

87,i am very happy with my purchase of the kindle paper white i wanted a device for reading at night that would allow me to turn the light off in the room work well is lightweight and really a joy to read on very limited and dissappointing selection of protective vers at best buy had to purchase elsewhere
88,this is the perfect product for listening to internet radio at the gym without having to buy a smart phone and an expensive data plan i selected the gym is wireless signal downloaded the sirius xm app put in my earphone purchased separately and began listening since this item wa part of a black friday sale my total st wa well under it is small enough to carry with me and the screen is easy to read

93,i observe my year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease she is able to play some of the game and upload movie her mom had to put a secret password for the movie because she downloaded some that you had to pay for
94,the paperwhite wa the perfect upgrade to my older kindle that required a light in order to read in low light nditions
95,i wa initially excited to get the kindle i am extremely disappointed with all the ad even more disappointed to find out that i uld pay amazon more money to remove the ad it is frustrating that best buy and more specifically amazon do not let the nsumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you re buying is a mini advertising billboard why uld not there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the low price is subsidized by all the ad on the device would this have changed my purchase absolutely i would have spent a uple buck more and probably got a samsung tablet
96,not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage
97,what can i say if you enjoy book and magazine it is hard to beat not backlit but not an issue for me i take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much
98,the fire tv fill my need for a streaming device i m able to access p vue netflix amazon prime and other channel apps the remote and interface are intuitive and simple and alexa is a nice add on feature much remmended for anyone looking for a streaming device
99,santa got this for my y o it work well on wi fi can link to our movie library via dma app add educational apps and can expand memory via sd card she cannot put it down much to our chagrin

104,bought for my yr old they absolutely love it clear display and durable
105,if you can afford to get the hd version i would go for those however this is a great starter kindle love all the parent ntrols
106,i initially wanted to buy a kindle but uld not pa up the great deal and thought i uld exchange it if i changed my mind it work great and ha plenty of memory for what i needed which wa strictly to read i liked that i uld also watch netflix on it the only downside for me is that unlike the kindle i cannot read it in the sun but that is not that much of an innvenience so far overall i have been very happy with it
107,this is my the kindle and is well worth the price
108,echo ha a better than expected speaker that play music well hook it up to spotify through the alexa app and tell it what you want to hear
109,we bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it work great we love how it can be set up for different user

114,it work great if you have a chance to get one i would remmend it
115,purchased for my wife so she can play game and not tie up her phone seems to play her game alright it is a bit slow when opening thing like the internet facebook or netflix still a decent little tablet for also limited to amazon app store so a lot of android apps are not available like dice with buddy
116,i would and have told people to get one if they have a k tv
117,i would not buy again had trouble w shutting off all the time we would have it reset back to the factory reset status and it would lock up and freeze actually replaced with send thinking that wa just a bad one however sad to report same problem not a favorite purchase
118,we actually bought these for our summer camp program and the kid love them they small enough for their hand to carry and they work like a charm the staff wa super helpful
119,i didnrealize what i wa missing until i bought one love this thing make being in my kitchen so much more pleasant because answer are right at my fingertip and i have access to so much music buying several a xmas present

122,this wa a christmas present for my niece she loved it
123,bought both the echo dot and the echo home the tech responds to mmands from everyone in the house including the kid but the echo search engine need a lot of work
124,this is an amazing tablet for the price i bought at christmas for the grand and one for me
125,it is a ton of fun we enjoy the ease of use our house is not automated so we do not get full use of it i do wish it used google instead of bing but it work
126,my only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps i use in my phone
127,his product is exactly what we thought it would be no mplaints
128,this amazon fire table is a great bargain it not a top of the line table and you cannotell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price doe a whole lot day to day regular use or just for kid and people that dont really care about some extra feature that flagship tablet bring it amazon
129,got it for my daughter and she love it and i love the child age range usage
130,i bought this for my wife is birthday present she absolutely love it it is easy to use easy on her eye and she prefers it to paper best present i have given her this year
131,my fiance really enjoyes it i would definitely remmend
132,there is no doubt that this is the best kindle device available the battery life is astonishing and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience it fit like a glove so what are the n you may ask for one the battery life depends on the provided case it act like a travel charger in a sense why a n well it limit your customization option and there is no way to purchase other lors or replacement for it at this time so you best be cautious with it and two the price obviously but if you take into acunt that you basically are given a premium case the device itself is a premium device and you have a traveling charge inside the case it may almost even out but a device is hard to justify when it is just for reading still would remmend to any fan of e reader reading
133,have the amazon fire stick and box the box is alot faster worth the price love it have of them
134,really a nice item work wonderfully for the st it is a bargain
135,bought for my daughter so far she is very pleased

141,love the fire tv it is is fast and very responsive if you have amazon prime this is a must
142,i really like the kindle it so much easier to care around to read
143,new to kindle always read a book in paperback or hardver user friendly will never go back to reading book on hardver orpaperback extremely happy with the purchase
144,great purchase good for entertainment and it talk
145,easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issue
146,it great
147,if you want a tap to make use of amazon is alexa voice service then dont get one the tap is a fine enough bluetooth speaker for wireless music but the need to touch a button for voice service render it far le valuable
148,great for family time hd is awesome great product
149,great product at a great price so glad i bought this
150,this is a great reader indoor or out no light to full light in landscape mode it fit my small hand just great battery life is excellent also i would remmend getting a soft ver to protect the book in transport

154,best e reader for now eye feel mfortable for reading
155,this product ha been so thoroughly reviewed that i wonrepeat the obvious in any detail it is great for reading under all nditions sharp typeface and of urse illuminated two small issue in dim light nditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven there are slightly darker area just above each of the four light that illuminate the screen this doe not bother me and it is not noticeable in a brightly lit environment more annoying is the fact that the search function doe not work with some book for those searching brings up no result no matter what i enter i have the same book on my kindle keyboard and have to use that to find what i m looking for i have not contacted amazon about this but it seems odd on other book it work a expected one other thing to keep in mind if you have an older kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently given that it is illuminated overall i like this reader a the display is excellent it is easy to hold and page turn and other navigation feature all work well if it were notfor the problem with searching i d give it five star

167,my dauther love the tablet and i can get the sd to get more storage and load up all the disney movie that i purchased it is a great purchase
168,at first i thought it would be just another one of the voice interface that are on a lot of device it only me with a few function wow i never wa so happy to be proved wrong the omni directional microphone and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home because of it open source de you can add skill that other user have developed or download a sdk and make your own it read me bedtime story filter my ntent for news source acrding to my whim add mplex sum spell and is an all around good sport but the best thing is i had a few remote ntrol hub around wink nest the house because i hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than mpleting the task myself echo changed all that it unified my security lock my light and more through an easy voice interface i uld not be more happy it gave me more than a smart house it gave me a smart home i even bought a send unit to take on vacation definitely will change your life for the better

210,hey alexa hey alexa night and day it is hey alexa make the fire fix the breakfast wash the dish do the mopping ok so i have not figured out how to make alexa clean my house like cinderella yet but i m working on it in the meantime i have figured out that she is much more than a glorified alarm clock or dj although you should know that alarm are not currently supported on this device like they are on the echo this is a more basic version of alexa it doe not have her full functionality about mei m not sure what the target demographic for this product is but i am a professional female in my early thirty who is in a mmitted relationship that is a nice way of saying that my partying day are behind me and my boyfriend and i spend a lot of time binge watching stuff on the sofa yes we are suburban uch potato no shame here also i am an amazon prime member but do not have a k tv i used to have a roku that i used for netflix and hulu however i wa more interested in free shipping so i moved to prime and got a fire tv stick when it wa offered for for me the stick is a glorified hdml cable you uld get the same benefit by connecting your laptop to your tv it is le cumbersome but that is about it i wanted it because it said it uld mirror your device is screen onto your tv it didnexplain clearly enough that the only device it uld do that with wa a kindle although this ha since changed and can now be done that is why i didnorder the echo when it came out it sounded ol but i uld not figure out what it actually did since then my father got one for my mother who had a stroke and it is awesome read more
211,nice and mpact better than the older model
212,great price for a lot of fun this is my rd amazon fire great for game movie i installed kodi on it for extra programing and life tv i loved my amazon fire tv
213,great for toddler i remmend anyone to purchase a protective case
214,this product is the greatest thing not only is it a speaker but it is also a little mputer at the palm of your hand you can do so much with the echo that we are having so much fun talking to her there are little game you can play with her and she also ha a variety of other thing she can do if you are on the fence about getting an echo i would not hesitate and run to the closest best buy and pick it up now you will not regret it
215,this ha been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it
216,we bought this for our yr old daughter and it is great for most of what she doe but it is not good for playing a lot of game because it lock up sometimes or it run a little slower so if we had to do it again we d probably buy something with a bigger processor
217,it is a vert good item
218,buy this amazon box and side load kodi so you can get free tv box office movie and more google kodi and watch a video
219,alexa is a great product and i would highly remmend this product
220,since the fire tv stick wa announced i have heard a lot of people wonder if it wa something worth picking up essentially asking what doe this thing do that my tv doe not do already the answer is going to be different for different people but here is an easy way to think about it amazon fire tv stick is an excellent purchase if your tv is not a smart tv meaning your tv or dvd player did not me pre loaded with apps such a netflix youtube pandora etc your tv is a smart tv but apps do not perform well some smart tv have painful performance when streaming video apps can be difficult to update wifi connection can be spotty etc you want to access youtube netflix amazon prime pandora and other such apps on your tv you are an amazon prime member and want to access your prime video prime music and prime photo acunts you want to participate in casual gaming on your television you want to listen to music on your tv you want to have portability in other word television access to the above service while you are travelling amazon say the capability to use in hotel dorm etc with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is ming soon so the bottom line is that the fire tv stick allows you to access your movie music and photo a well a game and more via your television if your tv already doe these thing well or you re already doing them via other device such a a game nsole then this may not be worth your while so how easy is it to use i m telling you you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minute read more

248,the parental option need some work you cannot even log in to a child acunt until you have apps loaded for them to use also a kid is login doe not have access to pre loaded apps like the calculator seems really odd to me that you cannot give them access to basic functionality of the tablet otherwise the tablet itself work great

404,installation wa quick and i wa watching in no time love the voice search and alexa integration amazon integration is perfect unfortunately the voice search only search amazon video and not netflix like the roku for k this device support fps and the roku support fps i do not know if that is a big deal yet or not until i get my k tv i bought this because of the price point and i already had two roku stick i also found that amazon doe not support certain movie on certain device i e i uld not stream apocalypse now or full metal jacket on the roku stick but it wa available on the p you have to look at supported device in each movie to determine when i started mmenting on it in the amazon forum they all of a sudden showed up
405,i read a lot check email and shop that is all i want and need from a tablet and this one is awesome
406,quite simple it is a kindle fire tablet it doe exactly what it should do a a tablet attached to a reader i like that i can send thing from my desktop to my kindle it stream well and it work well with my bluetooth keyboard this is actually what nvinced me to do a year of prime next year we ll see how it go if i renew but so far so good the lock screen show a different advert but that is not so bad it is only a lock screen
407,fine for child but a bit difficult to handle with the apps
408,great for the person who love technology and the sound of their own voice mmand price is right too
409,first and foremost the echo is a good bluetooth connected speaker it is no sonos but i wa not expecting it to be it is really ol to ask her question like you would a real person and get some good result when is the cub game how are they doing and what are show time for star trek beyond yielded great result to be honest though that novelty while very good and nsistent wear off a little i would not remmend this to anyone who ha not invested in smart home tech because that is where the echo shine i currently have an ebee phillips hue sonos august lock and harmony hub right now the echo work with hue sonos and ebee with the harmony hub being tested currently there is no way to make the august work but there are way to make other thing work using apps like iftt and yonomi i suggest anyone who want one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing thing you can do with this awesome little device i cannoturn on and off my light turn on and off my different activity with harmony play music lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web it is really ol and we are closer to star trek than ever it is worth the money if you want to talk to your house i love it there are some failing it doe not understand some mplex wordy question while others it ha no problem with the list of mpatible device are limited but with those two apps i spoke of iftt and yonomi that list is greatly increased and the skill you can get are not good at all limited and poor but the potential is there and it look like amazon is working on it

495,the amazon echo work well so well in fact that i have not felt the need to use the remote very often however there are a few occasion when it is great when listening to music getting the volume just right using voice mmands can get annoying the remote is quick easy and allows greater fine tuning when there is a lot of background noise the echo is good but sometimes ha difficulty hearing rrectly when i have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise speaking into the remote never fails and also doe not require you to say the wake word when in another room i often listen to music on my echo even when in another room yelling across the house is disturbing and doe not always work but the remote allows me to skip pause or turn off the music from my office or bedroom it is also great for adding item to the shopping and to do list if i lost my remote or more likely dropped it in the kitchen sink i d buy another without hesitation
496,the echo is a great product to play hard to find music and keep you updated on weather current event and trivia information
497,have enjoyed using the touch screen to operate the page light adjustment ha been very useful especially when reading in bed with my wife sleeping

615,i bought this to replace a fire hd tablet that broke amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out i set this up for my son with special need i tried to make it a simple a possible for him it is a little bigger the sound is not a good a the previous fire tablet it also seems very slippery i got a rubber honeymb type ver for it that seems to help u to grip it better over all it is a good tablet for a child just use parental ntrols and get a good ver for it
616,excellent in all light nditions easy to use just what wa required
617,used with playstation vue this box rock it is fast plus when fast forwarding to skip mmercials you actually get to see what rresponds to the timeline unlike the roku streaming stick which only show the current image plus how many minute ahead or back you can go not the image just the increment with the fire tv you actually see the exact minute and send on the timeline along with the image at that time plus fire tv let you fast forward up to x actual speed
618,i love the box lot of feature can use on any tv home and vacation
619,set up wa easy plug it in turn on the tv learning what channel i can see or not see is a learning curve so far i am liking it but have to adjust to the change moving away from cable
620,this unit work great we ditched cable and this is a great alternative we have had no problem with this unit
621,i can make a grocery list request my favorite song turn my light on off all with my amazon echo
622,i bought this fire tv month ago one day out of the blue it stopped working power is on but a soon after i see the amazon logo the screen go black i google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it i just emailed the mpany and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted month before it became useless not a happy camper here
623,we love our echo music news and basic info it is great

640,this is my favorite set top box you have all the same function a the others but you can also side load apps a well such a kodi and emulator to play old school game like super mario and zelda if you have amazon prime the alexa feature is pretty awesome a well finding music on prime and getting random information

759,this kindle is much lighter than my old nd generation kindle the ad are no problem at all a they only appear when the kindle is in sleep mode the back light is great so is the price
760,k on fire if you want a k streaming with amazon
761,i am very happy with my fire tv it is make me want to buy another to go in my son is room
762,i wa truly happy with the product however i also purchased gift card each tablet since i wa not sure a to what brand to purchase one of your sell staff advised me that i should purchase google play gift card which i did to my surprise on christmas morning my grand child were not able to use them because a your staff should have known they are not mpatible i took them to the store to exchange them and i learned that not only that best buy would not exchange refund them but that you do not carry the amazon card you have just last a good customer when it me to purchasing some item that i can purchase online at amazon or another store i purchased an hp pc and a apple ipad at another store just to make a point i wa and still are very disappointed with your sale staff and your sell practice i will remmend the table to a friend but stay way from asking assistance when purchasing the right gift card
763,the echo is a gateway drug first i just wanted a bluetooth speaker with some novelty feature then i got smart outlet then hue light now i m looking at smart lock beware
764,purchased to replace the one i bought for my brother in august physical damage this time bought the extended warranty no issue or claim so far
765,great product i have two of these and a uple of the pod is these are great for listening to music solid built in speaker and the pod with bose bluetooth speaker is only a slight improvement i m already buying two more of these for christmas gift
766,great tablet for beginner especially with wifi function and ebook purpose
767,alexa is handy but doe not always work we have two light outside and sometimes both with turn on or off when mmanded and sometimes only one will turn on or off
768,wish tablet wa voice capable only problem wa how long it took for the merrillville in store to restock they ran out at christmas it took about month before they were available again
769,this is the best streaming device i have purchased yet hook to ethernet and is lightning fast
770,this is a great price point for this tablet i bought of them for my family to use to supplement their iphones youtube and netflix are easier to watch on the tablet is larger screen
771,work great with a k tv better quality than my other streaming device
772,fast and easy to use i watch prime movie on it and also play game on it also best part you can add apps to it
773,i bought this for my grandkids it is easy to use and they love it
774,the wide wide world of tv at your finger tip we love this
775,still feeling my way but if i have any more question will check with the geek squad
776,so at first i wa not sold on this i bought it mainly to act a voice ntrol for my lutron light on our first floor and i already had pi remote throughout so it didnget used that much then it kind of clicked with some simple thing like setting timer and playing podcast then it got more natural when i connected the alexa app and the logitech harmony app with ifttt next thing you know my wife and my son are both using it a we re ming and going to turn the light off and on turning on the tv turning off when it is time for dinner etc etc really excited for the upming sonos integration all in all this wa a very worthwhile purchase a it is beme a really strong platform for home automation and it only look like it is going to get better i think it is safe to say that the echo mean different thing to different people if you re into ha then do not hesitate
777,great for streaming kodi and much faster than firestick
778,always ntent with best buy and their product i would definitely remmend
779,i wa using a kindle paperwhite and when i saw this on sale for black friday i figure why not i have been very pleased so far
780,i enjoy using this product but doe not get a many apps and game a the android
781,debated between firetv and apple tv and ultimately went with firetv due to price work great easy set up and easy navigation i have not had any buffering issue
782,i purchased the amazon fire tablet because i have had one for about or year i wanted a tablet that wa sturdy and would last because i purchased it for of my grandchild
783,bought this for my daughter and she u it all the time i highly remmend it dd
784,the product wa just what i wa looking for got it on sale made it a deal i uld not pa on enjoy having alexa in the living room
785,work very well video quality is very good it is easy to navigate
786,i like the definition but the software ha bug i had to return mine
787,a real neat gadget that really work great tool for the kitchen too
788,much better interface than roku love the k feature
789,i like my amazon echo because it cannotie in with my nest thermostat and i can ntrol the temperature both at my house and at my store with a simple voice mmand i also like asking alexa random question to see what she know i like the fact that she learns more the longer you have her there are some thing that it seems like she should know but doe not yet i know she is still learning heck so am i
790,this is a great streaming box and i enjoy the voice search option however i wish that the amazon fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the option of a movie or tv show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just amazon of urse i can go into each and every app that i have a paid subscription with but it would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display result across the board
791,my kid love asking random question and it is been alot of fun
792,wa looking at some more expensive android tablet to replace a year old device and saw this one on sale despite the relatively much lower price i wa originally very worried that the amazon app esystem wa going to be sorely lacking mpared to the full google play catalog but it turn out that while it is missing some important apps not just game but productivity apps too the more than adequate spec good enough screen gb of ram decent processor are enough for of what i need from a tablet and if you can get it on sale you cannot go wrong lastly if you re deciding between the and this fire splurge a little bit and get this one instead
793,i needed a tablet to use in a classroom setting and the amazon fire worked great
794,great tablet for the price however the battery drain quickly
795,it is good for the low st good one to gift doe the basic job
796,the old one would not hold a charge but my new one go day before running out of juice
797,great product would remmend to a friend love it love it love it
798,better than i expected alexa is my new best friend
799,plugged it in connected to wifi and wa ready to roll k capability and p better than cable box
800,i have been using the amazon echo for a few week now i have to say it much more responsive then the google home when using home automation a must have for any home
801,we purchased of these for our child they find them easy to use
802,uld not go wrong with the amazon tablet for best deal there is only at best buy
803,my year old love his tablet he know how to utilize it very well it need a better camera
804,i purchased this table for my year old mom and she wa able to navigate with little assistance
805,this is a great little system for listening to music and simple mmands
806,alexa is very responsive to question request and play music also work a an alarm clock and play game
807,it really amazing device i really like it it working flow le
808,i just use this to watch hulu and amazonprime video and hbo the one mplaint i have is that there is no hdmi output so when i travel i cannot hook it up to the hotel tv to watch
809,it is a near a the public can enjoy towards artificial intelligence
810,these kindle fire tablet simply cannot be beat in term of value and bang for your buck if you have an amazon prime acunt it would be a crime not to have a fire tablet good strong build quality very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution they are pretty responsive have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kid use it a well
811,i love everything about this reader the book advertising on the lock screen is so ol in my house it such a small thing but it make u smile every time i do think it kinda weird that it flicker sometimes but after watching product video i see that it not abnormal maybe if i looked it up i d understand but it not bothersome enough to do so overall i would buy this item again no question asked
812,once set up is mpleted it is very easy to use many option available i wa able to link my iphone to echo and it ha made my experience much more enjoyable
813,i purchased this for my yr old who love reading but also love the apps and game available this ha a fast load time and i remmend a sd card to go with it we needed it after a few day of downloading book and apps
814,i m not normally a techie person but i read so many positive thing about amazon is echo and alexa i splurged and gave it a try i absolutely love it of urse asking question about traffic weather recipe etc can be a blast but i have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music i m in the mood for and even change my mind a few minute later without having to sort through cd is or putz around with the various play or radio station on my phone or laptop definitely a gadget worth the money
815,bought for my yr old a a christmas present i turned it on and set it up pretty sure she will love it
816,salesperson did a good job remmending this item after we explained what we would use it for
817,not really much to say here but it doe the job i m not use to the amazon store a i am with the google store but i can live with it this wa a spur of the moment but where i wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot and so far it ha been my traveling buddy for the price it is good and doe what it should without to many mpromises ad if your not looking for a lot nice stop
818,bought it for myself and then bought two more for my kid they approved it
819,i bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it
820,echo is a great product wish it had better understanding i find myself having to repeat often but other than that i love it great product
821,when back light is off it is just like a paper very nvenient for reading for night back light is so well done that still look natural
822,i love this thing work great with wifi enabled smart home product

842,bought this tablet for a relative for christmas who wanted access to audiobooks my only issue is that the tablet need a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps not a problem if you have nstant access to wifi but my relative doe not nice tablet otherwise
843,the fire box is very well made work great with amazon prime video and kodi the only mplaint i have is the remote doe not have a on or off button you have to buy a separate attachment for that
844,you get what you pay for with this product there are better tablet but this is a wonderful product for the low price
845,year old son u with ease older son already had a kindle and i also own on very good product
846,i got this on black friday for even at the regular price of it is a steal it is a basic tablet that will download apps and go on the internet while the internet browser is not that great it is mparable to a phone system which sts a lot more
847,love that it is interactive a long a i m connected to the wifi or via bluetooth to my phone the sound is pretty good tends to get a little tinny sounding if you turn it up too loud but overall a good sound i m still trying to find alexa is limit on what she can and cannot do
848,my son wa excited to get this and it kept closing on him returned it but they do not have any in stock to exchange frustrated and my son is upset
849,i brought this product and love it it is much faster than the fire stick and work great wit my home automation

852,i received this a a christmas gift i wa excited about this new product and downloaded the alexa app i am not an amazon prime member and i did not joined the free trial i asked question to my alexa and it usually did not provide any answer or uld not understand my question despite giving simple mmands the device look good and the led light on top that turn on when you speak to it is great sound is good for music however i did not feel that it wa a good assistant i did not like that you have to download skill to make alexa have more function you always had to speak alexa and then ask the skill you downloaded it then get to a point that you do not even remember what skill you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had i exchanged it for the google home and it ha been a better device it play music from google music and not only music that you have purchased it answer a lot of question and give you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skill it also provides more answer to question and i wa surprise by the detail of the answer at time i highly remmend to google home device i have not tested it with chromecast smart tv or with smart home appliance such a nest etc
853,the amazon echo ha very good voice regnition it work just a advertised and is quick with the response i wa glad to see it at best buy so i uld touch it and try it before i bought it the setup wa easy and quick
854,the product is easy to understand and use if you have already viewed a series from plex hulu or another provider the remote will take you to where you left off if you want to view something from amazon prime you press the button and speak the name and it find it for you
855,this is a great product at a great price they will make great first time tablet for kid

863,full disclosure i have only had ipads in the past i needed an android based tablet a a rd party app that i needed wa yet io supported you get what you pay for build quality touch and feel yes it is equal to the price nstant add urging you to make various amazon based purchase not my cup of tea but i guess fill a price point and need
864,although this wonbe mpeting with the ipad or some higher end android tablet this easily outperforms any other tablet in this price range i also love the fact that although this is made of plastic it ha a unibody design and great build quality not flimsy like many other tablet at this price
865,i love my echo and have gotten more for family best thing ever
866,battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good alexa is not a smart a the marketing would like you to think i get a lot of i do not know the answer to that
867,just got the echo last month and i just love it i plan on getting another one soon and would remmend it to anyone
868,love this product work great so far i would remmend this to others
869,before buying the firetv i had the firetv stick in an effort to cancel my cable i signed up for playstation vue vue worked on the firetv stick and got the job done but when a sale came for the firetv i thought why not boy night and day difference in speed of menu transition and buffering of show everything is just snappier and faster going back to a firetv stick wa so painful because of the lag in menu transition if you uld afford it go for the firetv over the stick also i own a roku and the firetv is much more useful because of the ability to sideload apps
870,initially bought the amazon echo dot liked it it wa fun and entertaining sound wa not bad for a small unit but upgraded to echo touch sound wa much better quality then upped it again to echo we gave our dot to our daughter but kept the echo touch to pair it the echo so we can hear same music in multiple room or living room and one outside patio etc work great that way we also have the bose wifi and sound link mini cannot beat bose sound but they need to address some technical issue i e cannot pair those two together yuh really

938,ha many educational apps i would definitely go into the setting if you re a mother like me who is a very strict of what your child watch on tv or what game and apps they download i would definitely remmend setting the parental ntrols before giving it to them in my personal opinion a a mother i feel it help by setting the restriction ntent on it help keep their mind away from the gutter bcuz most apps and internet website have inappropriate site child should not be watching we cannot ntrol what they put on the internet but we can ntrol what our child watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps read book most of these apps are free to i also remmend not putting a payment method option other than that my kid loved it

943,this is a very solid device for under the screen quality is great and performance is hard to beat for most typical use i needed more power to run some very intense apps like litchi for ntrolling a dji mavic so if you are looking for a powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast gb ram

1222,love the amazon fire i definitely remmend this product
1223,my son love his kindle great product for the money

1225,purchased for my grand child they love it they play and add gamehis
1226,i use it to ntrol the smart device it work well no problem about disvering the device the loudness is more than enough for my living room furthermore it allows the bluetooth device to connect to it
1227,this speaker is a must have the amazon echo ha wonderful sound and can ntrol a lot of electronics it cannotell you joke and even start your car
1228,so far i am enjoying it and adding other mpatible device with it make it amazing
1229,it is a decent tablet but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kid to share your amazon prime acunt for video and game apps you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchase problem is that this prevents free app and video purchase and you have to okay every thing they do if you allow them access to apps and video then that can purchase anything without limit on top of this they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive while you can hack it to add these basic feature you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so so it is useful but a pain too your need may vary
1230,great for reading book onlinei would remmend to friend
1231,i love the fire tv ncept i had the roku before and didnlike it so that went back to the store i have played with the fire tv for a uple of day and fell in love with it all my amazon ntents are on here i m trying to cut my cable tv provider out and i think i found a good solution when my fios ntract end i m moving over to the fire tv and i ll just get a hd antenna for the house this unit is very fast and very capable based on the android environment you can do almost anything on here entertainment wise
1232,it is great thing to use i use it for everything even working out
1233,thought this would be too advanced for my year old but she love it easy for her to navigate and learn patience game book and apps are great for the age range parental ntrols have kept her honest
1234,the last model of kindle hdx have been terrible we have purchased of each model of kindle and up until the last model they have been great last year had to be replaced or time and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts mpletely down if you try to plug it in to external speaker and sometimes it shuts down for no reason it is going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality a before phooey

1425,i love my tablet would shop at best buy again no matter what i need
1426,now i know amazon price their tablet at their manufacturing price ie the price it sts them to make it they do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchase made on the device then they would having it be a mpetitive tablet on the market other tablet may have better spec but i bought this a a send around the house tablet and it doe it job very well picture quality is more than enjoyable the screen is bright lors are vibrant there is a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing i love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have add the expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lot of medium amazon is app store ha an underground feature so a lot of paid apps in the google or samsung store are free to download here they have free cloud storage connected to your amazon acunt so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing item this also mean if you want to transfer item between device it is no probbem at all they have a reading library that give you access to many popular title for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself ha many free or very affordable book aswell with no monthly fee this device can mirror a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all setting and apps onto your new one also over the year amazon ha been doing free update for device to make them run the current o this is a nice feature when it me to always having the newest technology but from what i cannotell it is not optional my old tablet ran with the black carousel type o but wa automatically updated overnight to the current more visually pleasing o it did give me many notice stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device wa connected to wifi it may be something to keep in mind if this bother you overall i like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you re getting

1464,amazon echo is easy to use and provides a fun aspect to it application am looking forward to expanding to it use with home smart device only downside is with a grandchild named alexis not being able to rename is a bit problematic
1465,the kindle paperwhite is my first ereader and i love it it work a advertised and is very easy to navigate i have not tried it in bright sunlight yet but have had no difficulty seeing the screen in all other situation it is lightweight and easy to hold i have a ver on it which i find increase the grip
1466,overall the amazon echo wa easy to set up and use it ha some really nice feature but is much more useful for amazon prime member for thing such a streaming music
1467,bought this for my daughter and she love it great value for the price beautiful picture and it ha all the the feature she need for class and social networking
1468,amazon echopros amazing speaker and voice regnition i can be plus foot away and mmunicate with the echo speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated i mpare it with the ueboom device the amazon echo app is very easy to manage and add in different function to access so many different programed mmands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin the design of the unit is very nice solid from top to bottom quick summary of pro if you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather playlist talk radio and reading of non audio book back to you you will love this unit i wa not a believer prior to purchasing the device alexa is much more then just a novelty n the amazon echo is stationary if you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place so if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension rd or an outdoor plug if you do not subscribe to amazon prime then half of the unit greatest option are nonexistent with amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the amazon music store also if you have book you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those book on the echo and have them played back to you you can use spotify a a sendary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlist the voice mmands are clumsy what i mean by this is you have to ask the question exactly like it say in the echo app some example are alexa what is the weather like in manchester england alexa ask pga tour for the round leader or alexa play the best of the is play list from amazon music if you miss the ask blank she will me back with i do not understand the question n summary these may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the mmands exactly will limit the echo is capacity the unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic question overall if you have or plan to subscribe to amazon prime then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moment my family doe and the echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime to finding out the weather to seeing if our mmute to work ha any traffic to worry about if is not a lot of money to you for a more hand free toy then this is the unit for you i hope this help
1469,a above but interface is nfusing and swipe are sometimes not regnized
1470,my mother in law love her kindle she play her game on it and can use it without glass

1472,bought this model to use in addition to my current year old kindle fire hd inch model so far i am very pleased with the quality of this unit the slightly larger screen make watching movie much better i didnwant the larger screen yet
1473,worker told me about this device and the price so i checked it out and wa very happy
1474,very nvenient enjoy having alexa around the house
1475,bought for a year old granddaughter but our year old daughter love hers also
1476,i wa not sure weather alexa would be a real help and flexible enough to be useful it is great fun and great info if it only wa able to play my music pandora and iheart music it would be worth it but it doe so much more every day we learn how ask the right question to get the best answer and info the weather and timer are always helpful daily bible verse is great her programmed answer to regular interaction is great i highly remmend this product
1477,this wa such an awesome purchase i m nstantly asking her to play different music sending message set timer and even use her just a a speaker for my ipad she even ha learned the music i like and make suggestion i plan on purchasing the addition for light switch to utilize it even more
1478,i really like the large echo by amazon the speaker are clear i bought mine at best buy they will stand behind their merchandise

1482,alexa wa the perfect gift for a recently widowed relative she love that she can have music playing or ask about the weather nditions or the current news a fabulous gift and almost like a new roommate
1483,bough the tablet for my year old nephew love it great for online game and video
1484,i have really enjoyed my tap alexa responds well and i love the charging dock on my desk the only downside is the app used for setup is not very good

1489,who need a radio when you got alexa great product
1490,i would remmend this to anyone who want a portable device like this it is well worth the price

1495,i m a big fan of kindle tablet so i got one for all the kid for christmas
1496,speedy delivery item arrived a promised great gift for someone who ha everything and want a little fun
1497,amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e book it is also nice to get a six month subscription to the washington post their claim to have gigabyte of storage is misleading because it only give you and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage another problem is that you cannot flag something a being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablet
1498,bought a gift for my granddaughter who is she love it play game watch video and listens to music
1499,i gave this tablet to my yr old for christmas she is enjoying it very much i wa surprised how good the quality wa for the price i would definitely remmend it

1502,i love the idea of alexa and the next step to home automation alexa is fun and helpful at the same time update on the weather and news a well a some fact how to spell etc sometimes it doe not have an answer like when did nasa land on the moon i can ntrol my thermostat play all sort of music radio station ntrol it all from my phone and more there is a third party software mpany ifttt that ha appellate to allow you to acmplish much more with alexa

1505,great purchase would definitely remmend it to anyone
1506,smaller than i expected but easy to hold very difficult to figure out how to access library delete book no user instruction came with it
1507,echo is not just fun but useful to a small degree it is fun with apps like jeopardy and joke somewhat useful is the flash briefing with news and finding out the weather and the traffic for the drive to work somewhat more useful but still really just fun are the light you can buy and turn on and off by voice the most practical for me is the ability to add to the shopping list by multiple family member which then go to the alexa app that everyone ha which they can check while out shopping it is not star trek quality but i m still glad i got it
1508,the tablet wa a great price i have recently brought expensive tablet but this one doe the same job a the others
1509,it is tough to use these tablet if you are use to apple product internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the amazon program it is running everytime my kid play a game the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory i would not remmend these tablet for anything more that an e book reader

1558,the paper white kindle is great make reading in the dark is so much easier
1559,we had two appletvs one in the master bedroom and one in the living room we uld not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other tv we got the amazontv to remedy this while it did rectify this problem we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the appletv over the amazontv the amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate
1560,it wa easy to use very nice picture and the quality is out standing it is a little hard to hold but if you put it on the table it is a lot easier to use i would like to buy another one some day maybe upgrade to a different kind but overall it is worth the money that you pay for it

1596,amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great
1597,this is a really great upgrade from the regular kindle however it is not such an appealing product after amazon updated the base kindle to the same hi resolution screen may be worth waiting to see if amazon upgrade the voyage over the ming month

1725,we bought the tablet for my year old who normally u my ipad and samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we uld have ours he wa very disengaged i believe it is because it didnhave the home and back button like our tablet do over all it is an amazing device it just didnkeep our little one entertained

1734,i think i downloaded new apps i wait to surf the web this thing is so slow to respond my old refurbished ipad is better i really only bought it to stream hulu and netflix i m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisement every day but i guess you get what you pay for i wanted inexpensive i got it do not buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics
1735,this is a great tablet there are thousand of book and movie and music to choose from the amazon store it is very easy to navigate
1736,i bought the fire tv because a much a i liked my fire stick i found it wa not great at buffering and i found that often the image on the screen would freeze the fire tv doe not have that issue and the ntrols and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth also the voice ntrol work wonderfully
1737,bought these while they were on sale for the kid they loved it
1738,doe a good job answering your question easy set up
1739,i love this product so nice to have for trip
1740,before the echo we played music often for our toddler via pandora on the amazon firestick i am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology but with a music use case in mind and to experiment i pulled the trigger and bought one within a week i subscribed to the single device option for amazon music unlimited at a st of month after a free day trial now we rarely use pandora due to the expansive amazon selection i also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into philip hue lor lighting my experience ha been positive enough to also buy an echo dot with harman kardon onyx mini speaker for my parent while great however there are opportunity for improvement sometimes alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before i made sure my mmand wa identical and clear the suite of skill is weak and mostly pointless i only use the news flash weather and traffic search functionality for fact answer is limited and based on review is likely worse than google home there is no integration with the firestick fire tv which is surprising currently one must buy a logitech harmony hub to do so alexa struggle to find certain classical piece even though i have nfirmed them to be available on amazon music part of the problem might be the many version which exist for a given piece a well a the distinction between mposer and performing artist overall i would remmend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music but do not expect perfection quite yet
1741,love this product great for entertaining purpose
1742,no bad for the price the bad is the got too many add an you cannot take it out
1743,upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still suck but it decent for reading

1745,i bought this for my husband for christmas got it for uld not beat the price we found this wa a greal alternative to pricier tablet and clunkier item such a laptop and chromebooks when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing display is great definitely remmend
1746,i have purchased kindle fire in the past for our girl and they loved them literally to piece they lasted year before cracked screen meant replacement wa necessary these new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement wa easy they work great and the girl are happy

1748,i love my kindle i bring it everywhere with me great for the price
1749,bought these for my child they love the camera on them the last one they had didnhave is camera
1750,wanted a cheap tablet to read book and mics i found the lack of apps to be disappointing it seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy book from amazon or to buy apps
1751,but you do get what you pay for charging cable doe not work anymore and charging port is messed up other than that good device
1752,this is my rd fire tv so yes i am a proud owner i am able to watch any program that is on cable television with a simple tweak and you cannotoo if you do a little bit of research i would definitely remmend this to a friend heck i would even remmend it to charlie mix

1773,i replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster and it definitely is it keep apps opened to where you last left them no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv well worth the extra
1774,my year old granddaughter carry her tablet everywhere she love it
1775,bought this for my dad to watch netflix and it work very well easy to use which is a bonus
1776,alexa became my new best friend along side siri i ask her anything and everything shes great

1778,i got this cheap tablet a a gift for a kid they can play game watch video and surf the web at a very reasonable price the performance is pretty good for only a tablet
1779,work good but a little cluttered display i prefer the roku

1781,i wanted to buy the kid edition but it st a little more so i decided to go with this one and it turn out to be exactly what i need i am not sure but i think the only difference is the rubber case
1782,i use the email search and read book primarily my fingertip are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve i forget how to access some thing but ask those who know the kindle fire can do so many thing for the modest price i just need to keep at it
1783,trs heureux que le livres soient sur icloud apr m tre fait voler c est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous me livres avec toutes le note que j avais prises

1786,good good good good had a lot of show on it and it is good good good
1787,work great for my grandson had the geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it battery life not great but with a bright inch screen on a thin tablet is not surprising
1788,this tablet is a thing of beauty the entire family love being on it work great
1789,good product i will remmend this product because it is an amazing voice ntrolled item which doe way more than you can imagine the speaker are also loud for the size

1791,my son love it read every day now i love the fact there is no internet game to destruct him from reading small size allows to take it everywhere wonderful screen for eye just perfect

1793,purchased amazon fire for my sister in law she really like it it u it for mainly reading her book
1794,i had gotten this primarily to watch movie and run some basic internet program i have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality
1795,this wa my send kindle and i didnrealize that it wa not paper white what a difference i took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white this wa not easy to read for me
1796,the review on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablet we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now we re out that money also the charging rd that came with it appears it ha been used before there is some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i uld find this issue and there it is everywhere this is a problem that ha been around for year but android who is the ultimate culprit ha failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger there is no click so you know it is in place it just slide in and out we have had apple product for several year and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase cannot even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy and will buy another ipad mini sts more but is much much more reliable
1797,i love the amazon echo i use it every day for news and weather update i listen to music with it and it is sound is really good i have now purchased of them for other family member and we talk back and forth through the echo
1798,really beautiful display is great for watching movie and playing game it is very powerful for the price and you can play lot of game from amazon for free they even remove microtransactions from lot of game only downside is you need amazon prime to get the most out of your tablet
1799,i enjoy reading my kindle easy to buy book long battery life
1800,it great it move fast only problem the battery do not last all that long but it a good tablet i like
1801,excelent product it work perfectly with the others appliance in my home
1802,great bang for your buck great for taking to meeting
1803,overall sound is not a good a echo my primary source for amazon ntent however the tap is great for medium volume music and radio station and a an alarm clock it is portability set it apart however it is nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disnnecting recent software update now allows listening mode it doe require a brief pause after saying alexa wake word but it doe work this drain the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button the portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my echo which is fabulous
1804,i wa fortunate to order one of these a soon a it wa announced a an amazon prime member i wa able to buy the fire tv stick for during a two day sale i figured for that price i might a well test it out set up wa easy and straight forward i find that the interface is quick and easy to use the interface and streaming on the stick is much faster than the amazon app built into my hdtv this fact alone made this a great purchase here are some more thought i have on the fire tv stick so far pro quick easy to use polished interface wireless streaming work really well amazon instant video load fast forward and rewinds really fast a dedicated prime menu allows prime member to easily see what free ntent is available unlike chromecast the fire tv stick includes a remote can stream your own video by first uploading them to your cloud disk can play quite a few casual game awesome irresistible price for amazon prime user i got it for during the two day sale better spec than chromecast and roku stick ultraportable i plan to use fire tv stick when i travel for work and to visit family stream local video and other ntent using the plex app http www amazon m plex inc dp bywcde thanks bikerider n included remote doe not support voice search that remote sts extra would be nice to have a send fire tv stick model that includes the voice search remote rather can requiring u to buy a send remote probably wonbe able to use universal remote with this unless logitech offer a mpatible device not a fast a fire tv but since the stick is so much cheaper this is not really an issue read more
1805,this wa a gift for my granddaughter she absolutely understand how to use the tablet and totally enjoys the product excellent charging time and last her all day best buy had the best price out of the nearby store staff wa very friendly and efficient
1806,not a huge fan of product that are not apple but this one is good have not had any problem with them at all
1807,cannot go wrong with it my first ever tablet it is worth the price
1808,we are very well satisfied with the fire it is everything we thought it would be and more
1809,this tablet work just like expected great for the game i like to play it is just the right size to carry in my purse no problem
1810,it is easier to read my book and stuff on this than my phone also had a micro sd card lying around to expand the storage
1811,bought a a gift it wa a bit smaller then expected but measured a described good value for the price
1812,it doe more than i thought it would i have automated many part of my home and it is more then just a gimmick
1813,not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything unable to download any google are android apps
1814,i d been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time best buy had a deal of the day on these and i thought what the heck here is a table radio you cannotalk to it doe a whole lot more than that and there is quite a learning curve not so much in how to use it but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful the sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station i can play ton of stuff from prime music online and add skill whenever i need them from the skill store all the skill i have seen so far are free so store is kind of a loose term it responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than siri or rtana with all the alarm timer shipment tracker wall street report entertainment update etc it is like living with a gifted le snooty ncierge i like it and would buy another if this one ever broke
1815,i would like to rate this and half star while the adapter itself work just fine i think it is underhanded of amazon to make you pay extra for it maybe i am not technologically up to date but it seems to me that most people charge thing at a wall socket not with a mputer usb port i think that i read that charging with usb take longer a well just like an airline charging you for taking your bag on the plane now amazon is charging you for thing you need to make the kindle work pretty soon you ll have to pay for the rd guide and update not very good customer service
1816,great for kid easy to use great price would remmend
1817,this is the send amazon tablet i have purchased and they both work very well my year old doe his homework on the tablet the screen is bright and clear build quality is good and he is delighted with the number of game available

1822,i m already enjoying reading using a paper white this purchase wa for my granddaughter it ha all the function i need one of the best thing is the length of the battery it only need charged once a month i know she ll enjoy her paper white a much a i do mine

1840,great product we are loving it highly remmended
1841,i just upgraded from a touch to a voyage and uld not be happier in my opinion this is by far the best kindle yet it operation and feature are similar to the touch and paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very mfortable in the hand like other e ink device unlike fire the screen ha a matte finish which is really superb for reading some early review i have read mplained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue i have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully ha been rrected the built in screen light is amazing like other e ink device the voyage allows better ntrol and integration of dictionary which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to nsult several dictionary in situ to fully understand a word or phrase there is very little not to like about the voyage i can only think of two issue to nsider price no doubt about it voyage is expensive but in my opinion it is worth it when trading off price and performance i urge you to go into your nearest best buy for a hand on look at the various kindles particularly the paperwhite and voyage to see what you really need want or can live with a minor point for the evolution of e ink reader it would be nice if there wa some ntrol of the screen background lor or at least an implementation of a warmer background recent study suggest adverse effect particularly regarding getting good sleep from using electronic device with bright white or bluish screen disrupts melatonin production in the body this is one of the few in my opinion advantage of kindle fire and kindle for android where several text background lors are available i highly remmend voyage the new king of e reader

1865,i have to say alexa ha been a great disappointment most of the time she doe not know the answer to anything and tell u that she doe not understand the question i thought this thing wa supposed to get smarter a it go along we had to sign up for amazon prime and unlimited music just to actually listen to decent music when she doe know a mmand for example like say loop mode when you want her to repeat a song most of the time she understands that and then there are a lot of time when she simply beep out or even say she doe not understand the question no matter how many time you say it we use her mostly for a timer alarm play music and for question of jeopardy a day really need a lot of improvement ask her what a dog say she say bow wow or woof sigh if she can only be basic on that answer there is not much more she is gonna get right there are also a lot of pretty useless skill for her available we got it at a disunted price thankfully and i also got a dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price dot is even worse at listening to mmands than echo is

1878,alexa is fun and witty and very nvenient especially when i need a timer when oking
1879,a a bluetooth speaker the tap rock the sound quality is excellent plenty loud when needed and excellent quality with no stutter in streaming i bought this one instead of the echo because it is portable and i can lug it from room to room the charging stand is very nvenient and the tap stay there most of the time having to press the button to activate each of the voice mmands is not an issue for me but is something to nsider if you want hand free use you may want the big brother echo device which is hand free but tethered in place by a power rd so not portable the feel of the tap with the black fabric ver is nice and will not slip out of your hand the fabric is like tough upholstery ver so it wonstain or be easy to damage but is quite attractive i am glad they did that a bare plastic would be easy to drop i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless and it work a advertised i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly question for fun i occasionally use it for shopping list which show up on my phone and checking the weather who know what the future hold when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do i understand that amazon plan to add more alexa skill all the time and if one got into smart house ntrol with mpatible product the tap would eliminate all remote which i already have too many of i think it is a really fun ol item and i am glad i got it it is so much fun to use voice mmands instead of typing especially the tiny smart phone typing i uld get used to this i have the alexa app on my phone which allows certain voice mmands to show up on my phone like shopping list to do list calendar the tap can also check traffic weather movie etc directly through wi fi no phone needed however the alexa phone app actually help you figure out what you can do with the tap the tap can read audible and some kindle ebooks to you a well btw i have not had any problem having it understand me which is amazing since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent obviously this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime member so you can stream prime music although it also stream pandora and other music service and doe many thing without any connection to amazon i guess the most unique thing about the tap is it ability to stream wi fi music directly without a mputer or phone driving it that and the voice ntrol i have paid more for smaller just bluetooth speaker so to me this wa a super deal and ntinues to be a source of fun and entertainment

1966,got this for both my child after the nstant break on more expensive product the best decision i have made they are happy apps are amazing if you are using this for internet usage not so much if going to amazon app store and book it is awesome
1967,i originally purchased the paper white and after a week of that i decided to upgrade to the voyage for a uple reason perhaps my phone ha made me lazy but i have grown accustomed to auto brightness it is something that i do not even really think of at all until you have to manually adjust it the voyage is currently the only kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen i have read review that question the efficacy of it and those people tend to say it is hit or miss i humbly submit that that is because it is a smart auto brightness that adjusts to your preference at certain light level for instance if you re in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there and you manually turn it down a few notch the next time you re in that room the kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference wa at that light level and adjust i have had no problem with this feature and nsider it the most indispensable feature on the kindle it is brilliant page turn haptic button these are great and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page i simply squeeze i do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device a i find i have needed to adjust my grip lower than i normally would have held on to the device it is very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it the flush screen this make a big difference to me i wa not a fan of the recessed screen on the paper white and even the nook ha a flush screen amazon really need to introduce waterproof kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that this is also my only negative about the device the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the paper white and i have heard wether it is true or not that is because the voyage ha a glass screen while the paper white ha plastic i m not sure but the only time i notice this is when i m reading the the sun is directly behind me i may need to tilt the screen degree in any direction and it is easily readable again the general design is sleeker and feel better in my hand than the paper white this also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the paper white which is always a good thing to recap this is the only kindle to feature the auto brightness feature not even the oasis ha it probably to save on weight and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the paper white
1968,love it great buy use it all the time yes i would buy it again
1969,my year old sister in law spends many hour each day alone she ha macular degeneration and is not able to read or use a mputer the amazon echo ha been a friend and mpanion by making it possible for her to get answer quickly to all the question on her mind and to select music that she want to hear

2116,a little disappointed with my first experience with ai you have to learn to mmunicate with alexa to get result i feel like she should have to learn more about me than i her however i understand she is a gen and would expect that future version will closer be to the jetsons than something that keep telling me i didnunderstand what you said i doubt amazon will update the existing unit with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy she doe have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill application

2131,alexa is amazing keep me and my kid entertained for hour everyday
2132,alexa ha been around awhile so it doe what you would expect it to do i wa slightly le impressed with it only because i wa not an amazon prime member which limit is productivity if you want a full experience with alexa you have to be a prime member since i mostly use google product already it made sense for me to get the home which to me is a little bit more functional than alexa only due to the google search engine overall if you re in the market for such a connected device you cannot go wrong with either
2133,purchased before going on vacation good price and mpact design work great better than paperback
2134,i purchased this for my wife for mother is day a the screen on her phone wa too small she thoroughly enjoys it and u it daily just what she wanted and needed

2139,i had the original kindle fire from many year ago that survived many a drop onto ncrete floor without sustaining any damage so i hope this one will last a long easy to start up and charge fast already had a uple of o update that were very fast downloading and installing no problem
2140,the echo is very ol the voice mmands take a little practice but the option are fantastic totally remmend
2141,i got this for my wife and she love it great speed and display

2170,this is a low st item that provides huge return for the money spent it is a great little tablet
2171,the flush bezel and display are a huge improvement the text is crisp and easy on the eye the page press function and inclusion position of the touch sensor is perfect the price seems a bit high for something a simple a an e reader but if you love to read this is a must have you will not be disappointed

2275,this table is good for child because wonbreak if dropped however the only problem i have a well a other people in the family who bought the same table is the charger port that get damaged after first few day of use

2320,i especially like the variable lighting which allows me to read at night without any external light or in the brightest outdoor light
2321,i bought this kindle primarily for traveling and quickly fell in love with it i love the appearance and weight
2322,great product and best buy wa the best place to purchase from
2323,i ll admit that i sometimes think of this a the mputer on star trek but i appreciate the wit of some of the response like when i asked alexa did you miss me
2324,in this case the answer is yes amazon beat google by a long shot the google product doe not match up amazon ha done a great job integrating with other home security product a well a the hue nest etc on top of that the voice regnition is send to none if you re an amazon acunt holder you can order with it if you re a prime member you can access it is music you can anyway just get more with prime also play well with other apps like pandora it is great beat google hand down
2325,i bought the amazon fire with realistic expectation i have an iphone se outstanding phone so the intention wa to be able to play some free game view facebook etc on a slightly larger screen some light web browsing and maybe read an electronic book here and there it ha served this purpose with excellence so far not the fastest tablet you ll ever find i m sure but no slowpoke either and i would venture to say you will be hard pressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at highly remmended
2326,i wish it uld stream music from my private na and not only from purchased online music source need to buy hub and other interface for it to ntrol light and heating
2327,lady had been looking for one of these since xmas and found one and love it
2328,if your looking for a simple tablet that doe basic thing this is the one for you i like it
2329,my kid love this tablet the setup wa so easy and the amazon store ha a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning
2330,need an alternative or supplement to cable tv this is it there are many entertainment option with the firetv i can not sing it praise enough
2331,bought this for easier reading and it meet my expectation great display fidelity
2332,the echo is great for reporting the latest news weather and playing music
2333,i got this tablet for one of my usin is kid who is really enjoying this so far
2334,i like that you can choose to use wifi or ethernet cable
2335,i started with the fire stick and then upgraded to the fire tv it ha a much faster processor and run add ons better great for your home tv set
2336,i love alessa i love to play music all day long
2337,i like the nvenience of my kindle a lot for reading and the process for buying book from amazon is easy and flawless a well a cheaper than buying physical book there are a lot of special of very good book i just wish the kindle wa slightly larger more the size of a typical paperback book because when i m reading it feel like i m turning a page every few sends
2338,it is all i needed while away from my mputer on the go and at work
2339,thought the echo wa portable have to keep it plugged it to operate or buy an external battery returned and bought the smaller tap which ha a builtin battery
2340,echo need more skill and third party application and customizations and bluetooth audio multiform simultaneousso far happy with this product
2341,love the no glare feature perfect for outdoors this is light weight and will be great for travel
2342,just bought seems to be working great so far not sure how long it will last
2343,got the niece wife and myself these for christmas figure they were cheap enough so why not these are functional tablet in every way we have not found any problem with them the display is not a hi resolution so i wa not expecting great i have had phone and tablet with the same resolution but never one that looked quite a lack luster a this display they are ok for the kid to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had this one probably wont last much longer but it is cheap i wish i would have spent a few more buck and gotten better one for my wife and i though if you want a disposable tablet or lor reader for magazine and such you ll probably be ok with this if you want a good tablet think about buying a good tablet
2344,this tablet is le than and is an outstanding little tablet the only negative i uld bring up about it is that it is geared towards selling you stuff from amazon it doe book web surfing and apps quite well though it is well worth the money and putting up with the advertising
2345,this is very nice for a little over dollar it took a bit to get use to after using a ipad i got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight
2346,great tablet for the money and basic medium i enjoy it for reading audible and streaming video u amazon app store which u google play thousand of apps
2347,i previously had a roku however decided to purchase the fire tv box instead it definitely meet all my need and ha been a real pleasure to use
2348,if you are into reading then this is for you i didnthink the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room great for reading outside
2349,i got of them they didnhave google plus me no like
2350,i really like this product much better than my old kindle
2351,this is a great tablet for my year old grandson the ver is great in that if he drop it it wonbreak great buy
2352,i bought this for my sister a a birthday gift and she love it
2353,you do not have to pay a high cable bill if you purchase product
2354,i wa looking for something easy to use if i didnwant to go on the mputer and for this is great
2355,my family ha been enjoying amazon stuff more lately and the kindle fire tablet is no exception i have not spent enough time on it to get what i need a efficiently a i can on my samsung galaxy tab but my husband prefers it to his galaxy tab currently in use by our yr old son remote are too mplicated sometimes our family joke anyway but he ll sit down and browse the amazon ntent get all the car stuff he enjoys reading and i have not heard a mplaint or call for help i have not even heard any annoyed caveman sound i like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet may sound trivial but my main mplaint with both galaxy tab is that the input are on the bottom so they cannot sit upright for use while being charged bottom portrait for the tab and bottom landscape for the tab either way it hinders function functionality during charging is not disturbed with the fire tablet when i m ready for a new tablet i ll probably get the galaxy pro because it seems friendlier for blogger writer etc but the kindle work if you re not looking for something too mplicated price point is great too
2356,tablet is good for older kid with added boundary
2357,got two one for each of my grand daughter they love the portability and it allows them to both be up at the same time
2358,good tablet and a great price i use it for reading netflix and email
2359,so we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now buying one piece at a time and implementing them make the st le scary we have a wink hub cree led light myq garage door opener atdigital life security and automation nest thermostat etc it ha been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit u in real life rather than in cheesy video clip on youtube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone you may be wondering how the echo fit into this review well before alexa came into our life we had to have a phone or tablet on u unlock it find the relevant app open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do now we just say alexa bedroom light or alexa turn the bedroom lamp off or alexa play bloodhound gang on spotify etc the echo make utilizing your home automation much easier plus with the ever growing list of skill i can start my car play a game listen to music get my news ntrol medium playback order a pizza buy stuff from amazon even schedule an uber pickup etc if your specific car or app or whatever is not available yet just give it some time and it ll most likely end up supported very very ol technology
2360,these are great for my teen to use at school now that their school u online activity
2361,affordable for the kid and quality is good not like other cheap tablet amazon always make a good product
2362,it is a great tab for low end application especially for kid

2366,i love this product and my kid use it everyday to watch movie and serial
2367,ha some good apps and performance is good for the spec

2369,easy to read in the sunlight i really like that it adjusts to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere
2370,i wa not happy when my original kindle paperwhite failed after the warrantee period expired but i loved the battery life and readability in almost all environment
2371,i got this for dollar a part of thanksgiving promotion it normal price is it a good starting level tab for basic purpose it not a smooth a ipad or galaxy note but it ok for basic browsing i specifically got this for my year old to watch youtube and play some light game and it work perfect i am not much used to android so i found it a bit tricky to use it also ha a slot for microsd card so that solves your memory issue
2372,great way to save on cable wifi enabled so really simple to install
2373,i bought this so i can save all of my book it wa a bit small at first but you get used to it overall i am very satistfy
2374,if you want a tablet to perform basic function you cannot do any better than the kindle fire check email social medium surf the web download and read ebooks with no problem good battery life

2400,i like the way i can read many book and magazine a well a play various game on my kindle
2401,echo is awesome hand free to listen to music get weather and news amazing
2402,the amazon fire tablet is a great tablet for the money got it during black friday for but even at is still a good deal you can get most apps on the amazon underground store for free and most add ons for the apps are even free mpared to cent each for apple device only drawback for my preference is that there is not a facetime app to videochat with other apple device user with other than that pretty much any other io app is available for the amazon fire video play very well not hd quality but not bad either this is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet check email facebook etc and for the price it cannot be matched by any other tablet on the market
2403,i love this charger charge my device super fast and i do not have to wait hour

2407,reader is lightweight easy to hold and make reading much easier le of a burden with lengthy tome reader is effortless to learn how to use and access other book within our library
2408,i like this tablet it is a little slow starting up but st and display are very good it is mpact enough to take with you battery seems good so far i put on a few game for the grandkids i am glad i purchased this tablet
2409,using echo for weather music and asking question worry about ordering stuff online still learning all the thing you can do with alexa
2410,i think this is faster and more reliable than the firestick no drop out
2411,bought the wemo wifi switch and plugged the tv into it great for voice remote turning on off the tv
2412,i got this over the roku ultra which is k mpatible roku wa garbage the amazon fire tv is a must if you have a amazon acunt it a great streamer i have no buffering problem

2427,the kindle is perfect for fast browsing reading ebooks my kid love the product and i am now using the tablet for work it fit perfectly in my bag and with the swipe method i cannotype a lot faster

2433,i would remmend this for kid age to they can play al kind of game that can be downloaded
2434,i cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick and liking it it is a great product and with my amazon prime membership give u lot of viewing option especially for the kid who do not mind not seeing the latest episode of their show we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service which is available on the fire tv the kid also enjoy all the game on it the only issue is that many of the game that the kid want to play require a separate ntroller which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one
2435,with an hd antenna and fire tv we said goodbye to the cable mpany everything you want to watch for a fraction of the price

2445,pro look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader the price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it you might want to nsider the upgraded kindle paperwhite with ppi if price is a ncern n the bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the paperwhite

2447,the best e reader that i have ever used i would remmend it
2448,the best tablet for kid the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kid love it
2449,the new amazon fire tablet is surprisingly good especially for the price the performance is good the size is good and the weight is good the biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot which is something new for this generation of fire there are a few downside issue however first the screen ha splotchy illumination from the edge lighting there are numerous light hot spot around the edge especially at the bottom where the menu bar is after a while you get used to it but mpared to other higher priced tablet it is annoying the software library is the send biggest issue amazon ha done a decent job in adding new software but it is app store is nowhere near a robust a the google and apple store the last issue i have is the day warranty but that is how they keep the st down amazon developed the fire tablet to sell other amazon product and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability web browsing is much better than my first kindle fire and i think better than browsing on an ipad the app that surprised me the most is the e mail client and how easy it is to use in my opinion it is a lot better than the native e mail client on the ipad or a window tablet if the build quality a good a a ipad or samsung tablet no not even close but for it is pretty good device if you do not mind dot of light around the edge

2497,i do not nsider myself a heavy reader i read a uple book every few month but i love my new kindle it is lighter than some of my book which is great but the best thing is that i can read at night in bed without disturbing my wife the e ink display allows you to also read outside in direct sunlight perfect for the upming summer month it is relaxing to just go out to a local park sit under a tree and read your new book if i had to find a fault with this kindle it would be the ad you re already paying a decent amount for an e reader then if you do not want ad on the lock screen you have to pay amazon more money they do not really bother me so it is not worth taking away a star they might bug you though so just keep that in the back of your mind before buying this that you will have to pay amazon to have them removed

2570,the fire stick ha more than enough to offer in entertainment something for every one is taste the programming is not disappointing the equipment is inexpensive and you have ntrol of any other expense like subscription your bill will be far le than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the program the only thing that need to be done is having local channel available without an antenna which may or may not help reception i also miss own

2572,i bought this tablet for my son to watch movie and play game on and it ha proven to be a great tablet so far would definitely remmend this tablet to any other buyer it is tough and sturdy

2578,fire tv box is great for streaming show movie or music i connected it directly to internet rather than using wifi and have not had any issue with buffering
2579,bought this for my mother she thought it would be good for calendar and reminder after setting up and installing a few extra apps she seems to enjoy it but mostly using it for music weather etc
2580,i am glad that i bought the kindle paperwhite for my daughter it is easy to use and is perfect for reading anywhere
2581,i love it easy to learn and operate quick response and easy to hook up
2582,my son is crazy about it nice size good grafics and internet nection
2583,alexa doe well with basic application hopefully amazon will ntinue to improve on it is ability to answer more in depth question besides the weather and play music
2584,fun product that is very user friendly to operate
2585,purchased this a an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite the backlight is greatly improved the display is of a higher quality the word are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker opening book and page flipping is noticeably speedier the one thing that doe annoy me about the rd generation paperwhite is the way it is manufactured when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen you can see a small section of the display vered in the e ink used to render the word and image on the rest of the screen at first i thought this wa a manufacturing defect so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model only to find that the send model had the same issue except more visible this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process when the paperwhite first came out it wa the crown jewel of amazon is e reader line and amazon wa careful to precision craft the device now that honor fall to the more expensive voyage with the paperwhite beming the flagship but still cheaper option in the kindle lineup meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced mpared to that of the voyage this wonbe a huge annoyance for some people it is for me and it is seriously made me nsider whether it is worth contacting amazon over for everyone else though this is a great e reader and well worth the money if you re looking for an e reader this is the one to buy
2586,i may be slow to catch on to streaming i wa unaware of the depth of available medium material thing to nsider are internet download speed mb minimum and too many choice it is similar to the internet before the world wide web www some android apps such a kodi with fire tv guru make some of the material more easily accessible good luck
2587,i didnwant to spend a fortune on something i just needed a quality tablet to read my book check email play on pinterest and twitter etc this price is phenomenal for the quality i actually bought one a a gift a few week later
2588,easy to use with a ton of feature great resolution
2589,great sound quality and with amazon prime great selection of music
2590,we have a lot of fun with this product doe not always have the answer but we just have to phrase the question appropriately
2591,this product work but work slow mpared to apple and some android phone tablet like i stated in my summary you pay for what you get no major issue thus far
2592,awesome and reasonable this fire tv box pack enough punch for your viewing with more than adequate ntent that it will knock you out and for a rea onable price that you can afford

2612,rd cutter here we had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our mfort zone since we are prime member we finally decided to give amazon fire tv a shot we have been using fire tv for two week now and we ll never go back to cable pro ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which take up very little space simple remote and a free app so you cannoturn your cell or tablet into a remote no buffering issue have yet me up although that may be because i have a very strong internet connection seamless interaction with our prime video acunt and amazon music across all device for example if i download a movie from prime on my tablet watch some of it during my mmute when i get home and turn on fire tv i can pick up right where i left off from my tablet seamlessly without having to manually sync me with thousand of channel apps loaded including all of the the major service we use can be used for game we have not tried any game yet the voice mmand feature is outstanding speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it with multiple option for buying renting or just viewing for free if available i have never been a big voice mmand user with other device but this one work so well that using it ha already beme a habit using the amazon photo app you can instantly upload all of your digital photo from your phone or tablet to your fire tv for large screen viewing of your photo n no way to customize the home screen layout at least no way that i have been able to figure out overall i m kicking myself for not doing this sooner since we use prime and amazon music it a no brainer for u to use the fire tv everything syncs automatically and transfer from device to device seamlessly edited to add the following section after reading some of the and star review if you are a first time rd cutter nsidering rd cutting or new to streaming tv service here are a few thing to keep in mind make sure you really take the time to do research and due diligence on rd cutting just google rd cutting to get started with several good article i m seeing a lot of and star reviewer who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for thing like netflix hulu etc fire tv and all of the other streaming service like roku apple tv etc do not just give you free access to all ntent they allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for a opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channel you will never watch if you do it right you ll have access to the ntent you want for a substantial saving over what you were paying with cable make sure you have a strong and fast internet connection this is very important we dumped our cable mpany in it entirety including internet service and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another mpany we have up to six device simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that a well a the streaming fire tv so make sure yours can a well if you re not sure call your internet service provider tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speed some apps require a cable subscription you can purchase a streaming service like sling which will bundle several of the channel you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps for now password sharing with one of your friend may solve that problem but i suspect it only a matter of time before that loophole get closed so do your research and make sure you can access the channel you want give yourself time to adjust to the new interface it took some getting used to when i lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide but the fact is i m no longer wasting large chunk of time mindlessly surfing the guide rather than surf i m turning to specific apps to watch specific program it liberating in a way that i didnexpect besides i can now surf all of the amazon prime ntent by simply using the voice mmand on the remote
2613,great tablet especially for the price i didnknow exactly what i would use this for when first purchased but have found many ol u
2614,love the light this tablet is great if u just want to read
2615,we love this alexa is so intelligent and our son love her also you get a disunt on amazon music you can hook the echo up to tv light and more just tell her what you want her to do
2616,this wa a great christmas present for my daughter
2617,we originally had a fire stick and still use it with another tv once we subscribed to sling it seemed like streaming became more unreliable increased buffering we made two purchase to improve the situation a fire tv and a wi fi booster the two together definitely remedied the streaming issue but the increased video crispness i we give all the credit to fire tv
2618,i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughter great item and just a nice a the more expensive one she absolutely love it
2619,i enjoy readi g and facebook using this item i also purchased my husband one
2620,we got our year old an amazon fire for christmas the screen wa broken a uple month ago she liked it so well that she used her own money and bought a new one
2621,a advertised work with nest spotify just wish it would work when on volume highest with voice mmand
2622,plenty of capability for e mail game and other app is they each have one now and love them more than the standard tablet
2623,i bought this to replace my satellite but have not done it yet it is laggy at time and ha connection issue the remote loo connection often and doe not connect back until battery are removed a bit hard to navigate with the remote it work well if all you want is to get kodi but it is kind off difficult for a newbie with prime subscription it is great
2624,we are having so much fun with the echo alexa play our favorite music we have saved in our libraryfinds new song give u news update and weather report i know she doe much more but we have not had the time to experiment the sound quality is great after we bought ours i bought a send one for a christmas gift

2634,i love this tablet it so simple and easy to use happy with how long the battery last after watching amazon video for hour
2635,i bought one from bestbuy instead of buying one that is jail broke that is a moral choice for me that being said i can add the apps i want the hardest part so far is getting used to not having a dvr and not being able to fast fwd through mmercials but i m saving over month over cable including the month of apps that i m currently buying
2636,replacement charger for my son is kindle work great highly remmended
2637,i wa expecting something more intuitive moving to google

2644,lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light
2645,i got this to ntrol my hue lightbulb and it work great surprised at how fast it is
2646,when i fist walked into best buy i thought i wa going to get my son a new samsung i wa nervous about spending that much on a first tablet for a send grader the sale rep pointed me to the kindle and i m glad he did

2660,great price great tablet for kid remmend the tablet
2661,i have had kindles over the year got to have one to read my book relax
2662,the paperwhite is an excellent product it is very lightweight easy to hold for long period of time and user friendly software wise be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet or amazon fire this is because of the e ink however i will take the trade off a you are able to read e ink in every environment sunlight dark room without any eyestrain something that is not possible with a regular tablet screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this if you have a prime membership you have access to all of amazon is library which ha a large selection however most disappointingly you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to amazon is kindle app which is an additional month i find this to be mildly frustrating however you are able to rent book from your local library whenever you would like overall i think the paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading with only a few drawback i enjoy reading on it very much
2663,i love the voice mmand and online resource
2664,nice tablet function well great item for surfing the web easy to use and set up yes i would remmend
2665,upgraded from an old nd gen kindle and this is much better

2683,very happy that i can finally view hdr ntent on amazon and netflix with this only gripe i have is navigating thru this software is a little nfusing not too bad though
2684,best buy had a sale on the firetv and i jumped at it i wa most interested in the speed increase over our firetv stick i have been very pleased with the upgrade i like having a microphone on the remote to do voice search or now alexa mmands turn on the light trigger ifttt script the speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved we have been using p vue a good bit very pleased
2685,i love the size and light weight easy to set up easy to use lightening quick download
2686,i wanted a tablet that wa a decent screen size that uld play game that uld stream movie netflix prime that uld check e mail that uld skype etc all while remaining affordable under i have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these thing effortlessly while remaining this affordable this tablet ha handled whatever i throw at it and with no hiccup i had the cheaper fire tablet prior to this one and that thing wa slow to process the most basic task if you re looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do then pick this one up
2687,i use it for listening to music when i m trying to study i use it to catch me up on news and also to turn off my light great personal assistant wish it supported more application phone integration
2688,i had purchased a google home first and wa disappointed that google home would not play my music that i had uploaded to google play the amazon echo will play uploaded music to amazon would remmend this over google home however i am sure that they will update the google home to be able to play uploaded music since it just came out
2689,amazon fire tv from best buy wa my send fire tv purchase in a week after trying the tv service i ordered a nd one on line from best buy picked it up in store within an hour the price matched the st one but the hdmi cable wa extra when i am used to using fire tv i will turn the cable service off amazon is alexa assistant is phenomenal for me is better than apple is siri this wa probably the best online purchase pick up in store experience i have had
2690,i cannot say enough about the amazon tap i enjoy playing music from it and that it is portable i can play music from my amazon prime acunt pandora or from my phone it is fun to ask alexa question yes alexa cannot answer all my question or find everything i ask for but it is still amazing

2763,got this for my nephew and he love it hard to get him to put it down
2764,simply the best the fire stick is also a great deal but for flawless connectivity fire tv is worth the extra green back

2773,purchased a christmas gift for grandchild who love both music and gadget
2774,very easy to set up and operate the voice mmand is especially nice when playing music and so far i have found the music library to be quite large with a good selection if you use amazon at all i would remmend the prime membership a it pay for itself quickly and drastically increase the available ntent in the medium library no i m not an amazon employee
2775,this medium streamer is good i like the voice feature
2776,great e reader long battery life wa hesitant to make the change from actual book to an e reader but i have no regret

2785,this wa exactly what we needed no if it uld only make me a sandwich
2786,we recently purchased this a a gift for charity we chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and uld not be more please it is very easy set up and super user friendly i would def remmend this for a child rather than a more expensive product
2787,i love how easy it is to use alexa we use it mostly for music
2788,i own an apple tv also and ntent is just a good very easy to navigate i also use my phone is app to navigate thru the menu
2789,great ncept and easy for kid to use but it doe take a lot of set up in many different area to work like you want it to you cannot just plug it in and go
2790,i no longer ha a cable tv bill with the exception of high speed internet fire tv ha helped in lower my monthly expense to mcast
2791,i gave it a a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an amazon paperwhite i thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it ha been she love it
2792,think of it a a solid but generic ipad it is not a impressive a what apple doe but it is respectable purchased for a friend and he is loving it

2794,i love the amazon fire tv it is easy to use and setup i use this almost everyday trying to cut the rd this make it easy to do

2796,this amazon fire tv box work a advertised it wa a breeze to set up and took me about five minute to figure out how to use the feature and function
2797,love the fact i can watch amazon prime with out video to voice delay

2837,doe so much at a voice mmand music news weather answer question but becareful it doe not distinguish voice so someone uld buy something and charge it to your prime or credit acunt

2839,i purchased this device a a gift and i got a positive review from many source it is good for the eye and doe what it is intended for price uld be little bit cheaper other wise there is no mplain amazon kindle ha a lot of source for book
2840,with this amazing toy you wonneed to pay for outrageous monthly cable bill just buy this and no more cable bill
2841,awesome speaker and home automation ntrol very remmended
2842,after reading both positive and negative review took the plunge because it wa on sale and wanted k had a little difficulty setting up scrolling the onscreen keyboard inputing password because the remote didnwork properly out of the box after the system updated the firmware no more problem after moving the unit to another house wa not dfficult setting up on that network some reviewer said that the menu is too amazon centric doe have a lot but no problem downloading and using other streaming service crackle youtube etc k limited ntent but quality seems okay on a k tv need a fast connection ha an app it uld be better if you do not need k and have an idevice house apple is box would be a more mpatible choice

2844,it a great tablet it easy to use and connect to wifi
2845,these thing are ol with the new muti room music option i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the interm great item

2849,alexa is great to use her regnition is good and if you have spotify and pandora acunts you can really get a lot out of it and light outlet kit saying alexa turn on the living room feel exquisitely dorky plus it is the only way to order the dot which is essentially the top of this speaker after a week with the echo i purchased dot for other room again to get the most out of this you need to own kindle book have a spotify acunt and preferably audible unlimited

2856,i got this stuff for myself to watch netflix youtube
2857,this is a good alternative for those who do not like the chromecast not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good
2858,without the light thermostat or alarm that you would attach to the echo doe not seem like a practical thing if you plan on having the other item to connect then it would probably be a better device for you again solid device i just do not have use for it daily

2901,this ver is a must have for your kindle reading device i purchased a different case initally and had to me back to get this case it is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected the kindle is secure locked into the case so you do not have to worry about it falling if you buy a kindle you must this case

2905,most apps you have to pay for basic apps like youtube will not download without inputting credit card information what tablet for child not plausible to put in credit card information
2906,the amazon fire tv is amazing i highly remmend
2907,just love my new tablet i have had a kindle fire for year and it wa messing up badly so i needed a new one badly
2908,nice for kid like the free apps built in the device can ntrol what and how long they get to use screen time

2912,tho is awesome doe everything it say and more only thing is it not portable but amazon sell a aftermarket charger base that make it portable
2913,gave this gift to my girlfriend dad for christmas and he absolutely loved it
2914,i wa resistant to buying an amazon fire because i thought my smart tv and cable box were doing a great job however now that i have tried it i m planning to add one to the other tv is in the house it is seamless and so fast and the ability to just talk to the remote instead of typing is awesome we nstantly use it now for streaming amazon netflix hbo youtube and more seriously thinking about cutting cable tv out of our budget altogether
2915,this tablet is excellent i use it on the uch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
2916,i bought this a a christmas present for my year old niece she love it she is nsistently checking her facebook and playing game from all the apps she a love it
2917,i really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didnmake it a keeper for me
2918,i have purchase of the amazon fire tv model black
2919,i do not really care about the built in amazon apps i use this tablet for xfinity tv streaming and it work great since it is amazon i do not expect them to abandon update like the cheap chinese tablet it is not speedy fast but for the money it is hard to beat
2920,my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the o is a bit clunky and le intuitive then on higher priced tablet but tough to beat the price speed is not great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for book parental ntrols are helpful but take time to figure out and require more step than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kid nsidering the price for adult fine for e book and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and o efficiency
2921,function a expected
2922,i bought my wife one she bought me one a few week later and now i m going to buy my mamma one great on the go take to work and business trip device my little girl love learning on the kid abc and loring app

2924,dollar ac to usb power adapter for buck
2925,my niece love her kindle tablet she u it all the time
2926,work great in my entertainment setup my only real mplaint is that you cannot ntrol it directly using an echo currently using a harmony hub

2933,if you have hulu netflix amazon prime etc get this because you can ntrol all of them from this device it is awesome and faster than the fire stick and you can play game too gotta get the game ntroller totally worth it
2934,i bought two of these kindles for two grandson they are very good with electronic item even though they are young
2935,i love this for it is music capability great sound easy function
2936,i wa looking for a kid tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it ha a kid mode on it which is really nice so he cannot order or go online without permission he love this tablet and it is very well build
2937,i bought of the amazon fire tablet because the sale guy said that they were great and ran really fast i have very fast internet and this thing just barely chug along if you play a game it nstantly stall and freeze the sound quality when i play music is terrible i wa planning on buying one for each of my niece and nephew if they ran well but now i know that would not work for them because they are horrible
2938,purchased a a gift and the owner love the functionality and size of the tablet
2939,my view me from being only a ipad user and my purchase purpose wa for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my ipad to watch youtube cartoon and she operates it very well i m giving this star because i m returning this in le than hour so i didngive this much of a chance first it seems it really want you to sign up for amazon free time month guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if i did that so created the child profile on the tablet moved the youtube app to the profile opened the app and got selection for popular music movie etc uld not locate a search feature after repeated tapping got music to open only to get a warning that this ntent is restricted in the amazon free time app what so i have to join to unlock youtube i m technically savy so the fact that i wa frustrated didnbear well for the granddaughter maybe there wa another way around this but i didnlook should not have to uple this with the random ad for game amazon prime etc that pop up and that wa enough for me so going back to get a window tablet where you click on the youtube app you get what you are expecting without restriction for the price i had to try this but not for me
2940,in my search for a wireless speaker i looked at various model and decided on this one because of the portability the look and how it synced with alexa i have an alexa and this product wa spot on the sound is great i use it in the balny and stream all music from pandora different station and the quality is great definitely would remmend

2961,i love this paper white it is light weight easy to use and the battery last for a very long time with use i only wish it were cheaper but the price wa not bad

2974,i bought this in thanksgiving day it is good for the price
2975,can not do without my kindle fire i had an earlier model year ago it is still going just wanted a backup
2976,i started out crazy hesitant about the product seeming skeptical of the voice regnition being overdramatized it hears me while a song is very loud a well a the information pre downloaded is awesome just for music alone it is awesome everything else which is not able to be explained is far beyond worth the money it is an underpriced item and i plan to buy more

2986,it is nice but there are too many specific line to remember to get her to talk to you also your family gmail calendar doe not connect if on icloud with iphones so she will not know your family calendar need update and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say thing with the skill
2987,it is a great product for entertaining love alexa on this but wish it would work with the echo
2988,only those who have an amazon acunt can work with this tablet

3027,so i have been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review is about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really disurage me you really do not know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime free trial i wa shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged for a full year of prime one day before my trial wa supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync is to other echo device a well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental ntrols and or password to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it star your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if it right for you good luck in your decision

3063,great tablet picture is super sharp and so easy to read
3064,echo is a fantastic product doe everything it say it doe and set up is a breeze
3065,i originally bought the more expensive voyage model and i definalty prefer this one it is much easier to grip and is doe not get a smudgy i uld not tell much difference in the screen quality the major noticeable thing wa the voyage ha a smooth screen and this one is a little rough to the touch but that doe not matter at all
3066,great for price wish the amazon app store had more apps overall good especially for price
3067,you cannot get a better tablet for the price and best buy had it on sale
3068,i purchased chromecasts the year they came out and while they served their purpose for two year they are just not very upgradable i recently bought the fire stick and fire tv box made by amazon i am also a netflix and amazon prime member both of these device are far superior to the option provided by the older chromecasts and even the new k model easy to use and upgradable with many apps and game and if you have amazon prime it is a no brainer purchase
3069,the whole family love it
3070,great battery life excellent screen to read help and direction uld be better but still very happy
3071,i love the size the portability the reading option the organization option the look of the page and the price you cannot go wrong with the kindle paparwhite
3072,i feel like it play the same playlist every time
3073,very simple to set up and use but positioning in your home is a matter of trial and error so that it can hear mmands from all location voice regnition is uncertain at first but the software algorithm learn quite quickly very good for streaming radio a the sound quality is quite good for such a small device highly remmended

3102,my first real tablet it work awesome for book and playing movie even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and ha a lot of free apps to play with if your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet i would look else where it is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphone is kind of weak at least for my taste movie look play great which is one of the thing i wanted it for good battery life and overall quality so for the price this is hard to beat

3110,the echo is absolutely amazing you can ask alexa almost anything and she ll respond with an answer my only downfall with the echo and the reason i only gave star is because you cannot really ask her to play a song with apple music she work better with an android phone i had to pay for spotify to be able to ask her to play a certain song

3132,great tablet for my and year old kid friendly safe and mom and dad enjoy it a well love that it me in a protective case reasonably priced for a great tablet the kid love
3133,we purchased this tablet for my daughter for christmas she is in kindergarten and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class for i uld not beat that especially since i m not going to send a year old to school with an ipad this tablet u fireos which is amazon is customized version of android typically when i look at an android tablet major deviation from vanilla android will make me deduct rating the parental ntrols override any rating deduction in my mind this tablet ha the best parental ntrols i have ever seen in addition the alteration to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter all in all this is a win win the thing that ha really impressed me ha been the speed and responsiveness do not get me wrong this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any mean with that being said i have used android tablet in this price range and they are garbage my wife ha an insignia tablet that st it ha a higher re screen and a few more feature but it nowhere near a responsive when it dy it will probably be replaced by an amazon fire tablet keep in mind amazon is trying to hook you into their esystem there are separate home screen for various type of ntent that amazon delivers your book on one screen or you can swipe to music on another etc from what i see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps the nice thing about the amazon esystem is that it is cross platform they maintain apps for android io roku window ma and so on also their app store is not a extensive a the google play store so i may end up doing some side loading that is not hard and instructional guide are available online for you so in nclusion this is a nice entry level tablet i would bump up to the fire hd for the extra feature if buying for myself however if buying for younger child or if you re really tight on cash you cannot beat it my twin boy are about to turn and these might be on their list for birthday time
3134,decided to go with the fire tv because of wireless issue and uld not be happier
3135,i am not the biggest reader but this made me start reading again really easy to use and very easy to read off at night or in the bright sun very user friendly and lot of little thing to make my reading experience more helpful and exciting originally got the basic edition kindle without the back light and instantly returned it not having to have a well lite room wa more than worth the extra forty dollar
3136,searching the internet is a great bonus with this device
3137,i purchased these tablet for my twin boy knowing they are extremely rough the year warranty wa a definite plus i purchased these in february march i believe and have had replaced not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on of them the only issue i have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited item such a puzzle and a few apps i also noticed that some of them require licensing update which are innvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi other than that i love them and my boy love them
3138,tried fire stick first to slow for me so i exchanged it for this fire tv i like it much better
3139,the amazon fire is a very good tablet that is very user friendly and the price is great
3140,it is a decent tablet for the price especially if you have amazon prime the ad are really annoying though and you have to pay to turn them off or pay extra for a tablet that me without ad
3141,i love my kindle the screen look the same a the voyager to my eye uld not imagine traveling without it
3142,i wa searching for a tablet that would be great for reading book and downloading game this kindle is the right size for a tablet work great

3160,i bought this to use only one application oh is it most difficult to get this thing to ntinuously work and i still cannot get the geek squad program to properly download onto the device i m pretty disappointed
3161,i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only n for those evaluating this a a tablet is that amazon ha their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available
3162,reliable and well regulated for dual voltage v and v without too much heat generation in europe asia
3163,my daughter cant put this thing down so it is doing what it is supposed to do
3164,i purchased this to replace a nd generation kindle for my wife she wanted it because of the backlight the item exceeded her expectation great battery life too i took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future
3165,i bought this tablet for myself because i bought the gb one for my year old and wa so impressed with it that i bought myself the gb one
3166,easy to use and kid friendly the price is more than fair on these and offer some decent viewing option if it break no big deal to replace it
3167,this box put roku and any other app box to shame
3168,amazon fire tablet ha been working well it seems to hold battery charge reasonably well it would not be great for the youngest kid due to all the amazon product advertisement but great for him
3169,great starter ereader very simply doe what it is made to do
3170,bought this for our year old son for christmas took it on a mile drive and it wa great for watching movie and playing game only mplaint we have is he wa unable to download madden mobile on it not sure if it is the operating system or something else great size and would highly remmend a a st effective tablet
3171,the amazon echo is not just an amazing sound device but offer an always improved upon array of innovative service my best buy for the year so far
3172,love love love my hubby absolutely love his new kindle fire great picture and easy to use
3173,much better than the stick it allows you to plug directly into your router minimizes buffering by so much get this over the stick

3188,i wa not aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music that wa a disappointment but other than that i enjoy the product

3195,ha a slight smokey look at bottom of page probably because that is where the ad are shown cannot reverse background from white to black reversing to white letter on black background creates le glare for night time reading amazon is the best for customer service a is best buy overall i m very happy with my paperwhite it is very light and now i ll read more very user friendly
3196,it is great i use it every day love the voice mmands
3197,nice sturdy case good way to start child on tablet
3198,i purchased two of these a christmas present for my child i had been researching child friendly tablet with robust ntrols to keep them away from undesirable ntent i found the fire kid edition but after looking over the spec and review i found myself unsure of it i wa mostly interested in the freetime application so i did some research on that and found that it wa available on other fire model also i came across the new fire hd which had more power a better screen and far better battery life at a very affordable price point i gave them a shot and i m glad i did i have the fire hd is locked into freetime mode so the only activity that can be done are one that i approve of but if i want to i can pick up either of them and unlock them to access netflix amazon prime or anything else i desire i currently have reading goal set up that they must achieve before they are able to access video or game and those are limited to x amount of time per day freetime also ha a bedtime feature which disables enables the use of the tablet during designated time which is amazing the hardware itself is exceptional the screen resolution is excellent it is very responsive and the battery life is spectacular they advertise up to hour of battery life and depending on screen brightness ours last almost that long regularly the only n i cannothink of is that the camera are sub par but that is not what i purchased the tablet for so it is a non issue for myself some of the review i read cited that the internal storage wa easily filled with freetime ntent so i installed gb sd card in them i also purchased some rugged child is case for them off of amazon this is probably one of the best purchase i have made in a long time the sound of silent child reading all day is priceless
3199,this tablet wa purchased for my son and wa a great gift very kid friendly offering child safety option great price
3200,my family love how easy it is to ask alexa to play music and some information my year old daughter love to play song on it all day fun product
3201,gotta say i love this silly thing total light show plus so much more
3202,bought this for my year old he love it ha access to the amazon underground store so he can buy all the apps he want i have set ntrols so he cannot accidentally buy something with real dollar a great tablet way beyond expectation for this price
3203,i wa not sure if this product uld do all that it is capable very good quality with excellent sound quality
3204,i have been holding off buying one of these for year but on black friday the price wa an astonishing the amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled it is a great investment if you enjoy book or medium
3205,i bought this for my year old son he love it just ha very limited game on it
3206,better than i expected in performance very reposnsive
3207,my mother love the kendal it wa one that wa rep
3208,i absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly i bought one for my parent and used theirs so much i decided to buy one for myself a well
3209,bought this for my grand daughter a a replacement for her toshiba pad same size and feature seems to work a well or better small st and best buy ha inexpensive add l warranty
3210,amazon tap is a great device the device ha very good audio quality despite it is small size the biggest difference between this and the larger amazon echo is that you have to press the microphone button before the device will listen to you which is great for people who are ncerned that the echo is always listening to what you say so far the battery life ha been great with the alexa app it is very easy to connect this device to different wi fi network
3211,bought this for my year old daughter she love it and i love that it me with a great parental ntrols set up i can let her have some freedom with apps and internet and be fairly nfident that anything inappropriate is blocked i can also set it up so that i can review her activity later on only reason it got star not is the battery life i have a samsung galaxy tablet also and it last several hour longer than the fire tablet with similar use
3212,bought the original when it first came never a problem original battery thought it wa time to upgrade
3213,this is a great new piece of tech if you are savy with it if not it take a while to learn but it follow the step
3214,the kindle paperwhite is the best e reader of them all you can not beat the quality of the screen it is the same resolution and ppi a the more expensive model of kindle the kindle voyage the only issue you may have is the limited storage capacity of gb but that is the standard storage for most e reader
3215,recently purchased this amazon fire box i am still learning how to work everything i am enjoying it so far you do have to have a netflix acunt and alot of the other application to use alot of thing however their is a work around for everything lol i will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the rd also
3216,i have had a samsung tablet for year and i have to say that i love this amazon kindle x better the picture quality is amazing it is light weight it is easy to navigate
3217,i have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and i think it is solid i had the apple tv for about year before this and mpared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when i made this choice the service i use netflix and hulu plus were available on both but since i am also a amazon prime member and the show are generally cheaper via the amazon store i chose the fire tv the set up wa easy and i like the user interface the system response is snappy mpared to the older apple tv but i am noticing a bit more random reset and freezing with the fire tv i suspect it is software related and can get worked out with update i think it is solid and would remmend the fire tv to anyone asking
3218,i wa reluctant to replace my previous kindle fire because i wa not sure i would like it a well i am pleased to say i m loving it
3219,great screen clarity and rapid turn on all function you need in a transportable tablet
3220,not a great display for watching movie reading book on here is very ol
3221,so much information is put at your fingertip i love the unit and i m going to buy one for my grandson
3222,the echo is a great speaker with clear sound that reach from one room to another the biggest problem that i have had u getting it to work with the nest thermostat the thermostat must be registered under the same email acunt a the echo otherwise the echo cannot remotely ntrol it
3223,i bought this tablet for my year old it is a good tablet for the dollar i paid i just wish i uld remove some of the amazon apps
3224,great sound it need to be a little more sophisticated in responding to input for example yesterday i told it to play mexican music didnknow any same with mariachi music uld not play any odd
3225,purchased this for daughter a a first tablet she love it and it is easy to use plus it wonbreak the bank for a great quality tablet

3231,my original power adapter ha died i purchased this work a designed but even more it is clearly a better engineered replacement unit you can physically see the difference from the connector cable to the transformer body
3232,this kindle ha been great i upgraded from an original kindle and have not looked back i think if you have one of the paperwhite is with the backlight you might not see enough bang for your buck to upgrade though
3233,got this little gem for a family member for christmas she travel a lot and this work perfectly for her on the plane screen quality is pretty good not high def but good my niece love her new tablet
3234,solid piece of equipment very reliable and stream great highly remmended
3235,i love to read but i rarely have time these day for those who do have the time this is a great device because you cannotake it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation the text is crisp and easy to see but i wish the screen wa just a little bigger i ultimately took this back and went with a kindle fire hd the pro of a tablet outweighed the n for my situation but the kindle paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their book anywhere they go
3236,i tried to set it up for over an hour and it would not connect to my wifi the orange ring didnlast more than sec to even give it a chance it just sat their with the ring of death no matter how quick i wa powered my router off and back on even my other device were connected just fine before and after so frustrated and no matter how hard i tried it didnwork so i just took it back and got a refund totally disappointed

3242,alexa is a great addition to the household very user friendly and so many question mmands to be used
3243,system load slow but otherwise is ok be aware that you are not buying a full tablet it wa what i wa looking for
3244,she love to use it to watch netflix and play game
3245,sound quality is amazing i really like the ability to take this on the go downside i wish i didnhave to press the button to talk and to wake the product up
3246,smart amazon echo i am enjoying having thesis amazon echo my life much more easy then before excellent amazon echo
3247,i had the original kindle fire inch and then upgraded to the kindle fire i purchased one of these a a gift for a uple of family member i setup these tablet and i wa surprised that for the price how fast it wa and it ha the same apps and pretty much functionality of my the screen resolution is not a good a a higher priced tablet but for it is great even if you have a tablet already this make for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about i use kindle tablet primarily for medium and entertainment purpose amazon prime movie netflix hulu and the news stand

3254,i purchased this tablet for my daughter i can set parental ntrols and it ha lasted her for a while
3255,i use this table to ntrol all of the smart device in my home it the perfect size to do so also ha the nvenience of everyone in the home having the ability to do so with out have to u my phone
3256,for a basic tablet this is perfect good price doe all i need it to
3257,not only is this for anyone who ha a hard time affording an expensive tablet it is just a great all around great buy i bought it because prime allows you to download movie onto the device so that you uld watch them on a plane or anywhere you do not have wifi
3258,see above review summary bought for my grandkids and they love watching tv on it learning how to use you should see their face when the tv came on with mickey on it
3259,i wa tired of my cable bill being so high so i got the amazon fire tv digital antenna this is a great alternative to cable tv

3264,can be dropped thrown and doesnt break awesome tablet
3265,the echo is a fun time for all i love that i can connect it to light the grandkids love to ask alexa question everyone ha fun with it
3266,cable is too expensive especially when you can buy this and get more than you ever expected you can expand the memory at will you can watch literally anything and although the remote is awful there is an iphone app that allows you to toss that unreliable remote in the trash get this thing thank me later
3267,i m so happy with my purchase i use it mostly a a kindle it is a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue it performs better than i expected for a tablet my wife returned her ipad pro after a week of mparing the two device only star because of the weight and the home screen advertisement both are minor issue
3268,i have been wanting a kindle for some time and am very happy with it
3269,got this a a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this cannot believe how light it is and how well you can read the text if you re up for him and do not want to be caring around an ipad or have battery life on the product while you re on location this is a must take with you product
3270,i got this on black friday for my mom for christmas she love it she never like my present so this is great
3271,bought for husband and he wa surprised it doe the work he need it for
3272,the vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an echo dot we didnknow what it wa until it started talking to u a we must have activated it somehow after our shock we found that it played music told joke and wa in general fun to use so we we arrived home we began exploring what the echo uld do wow it is amazing we have been amazon prime member for many year and this is a logical extension of the amazon esystem i think most folk who use prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do however not everyone like it my son in law say it creepy to have something listening to you in your home so most folk will have to get over that for the price it is well worth it to explore the future of technology

3467,i love my new echo ha a super loud clear sound also is so useful just being able to ask and getting answer when your hand are dirty or caught up doing something else
3468,if you are a digital reader you need a kindle this is excellent but expensive if you are a casual reader you will probably be happy with a le expensive kindle i do remmend a case
3469,would remmend for the right person that want low st tablet but ended up returning this item because it wa heavy and too wide for my hand to hold it wa too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet ended up just using my lenovo yoga since it wa more flexible and only about lb heavier
3470,i wa pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed the kindle fire this wa my first ever use of buying book on kindle due to summer ur i wa taking at the time in may june what i liked kindle book synched on macbook and fire tablet very helpful when it came time to write my paper the highlight i made while i read the book on the tablet synched to the version i read on the macbook desktop this helped a ton especially with thing like formatting the footnote watching video ol little feature while you watch a video you cannotap the screen and it will list the actor who are currently one the screen amazon shopping i can now understand people is amazon shopping addiction l i will give it to amazon this tablet became my gateway to using prime and untless hour of online browsing prior to this i rarely purchase item online i can see how they have made it so easy across platform portability i like that i will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading need rather than having to use my laptop or my phone what i did not like sign on screen ad there is no way to turn them off i suppose for depending if you purchased on a sale the advertiser are subsidizing the st of the tablet however i wished this wa stated a a feature before purchasing it i may have paid the money and upgraded to the next kindle if i had known it uld not be turned off turning off standby mode this took some time to get used to rather than an issue when you turn the tablet off it is really on a standby mode so the battery will drain you have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned off weather app i do not know if this is just my tablet the weather app doe not update a soon a you open it it take minute if at all to update with the current weather i have not been able to find in any forum if other people are experiencing the same issue i have instead downloaded and used other weather apps but at this point the app is worthless screen resolution it is not the best but i got used to it for reading and occasional video viewing purpose it is sufficient screen dimmer blue light mode i read and use the tablet at night and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen and the system is default dimmer and blue light feature is awful the blue light app allows you to set the lor tone however it is so orange it make it unreadable the app i use instead is called bluelight blocking and even dimming the brightness with the slider wa still too bright for me so i have had to download the app dimly so be able to set the brightness
3471,this fire is a bit smaller than my kindle fire from a few year back i still seems to have all the feature and is the price
3472,i really enjoy my echo i also bought a battery for it so i cannotake it place
3473,it is inexpensive so you can get many of them it also ha a speaker
3474,this is a great device i needed something small to read book on this device is exactly what i wa looking for

3476,solid amazon tablet for those invested in the amazon esystem
3477,it work really well with a lot of really ol feature it is still missing a few thing that the google home ha map but it is still better than the google home
3478,i like the product it work great it is just what we were looking for however we had to sign up for the amazon prime membership just to set up the acunt to actually use the product we were not prepared for that
3479,fire tv is a game changer definitely worth it to spend the extra clam on this over the fire stick awesome product
3480,bought it for my year old son it good to get him this for a great price and get him off my ipad lol

3503,i love it all you have to do is to talk to it i have another system i do not use just for no look for the remote the bad thing with the echo is that sometimes can understand what we are asking but even that is fun
3504,bought for my daughter she like it just for reading book
3505,i got this for my class i love the setting for it i have a child acunt so my student can only use the apps that i put awesome tablet

3507,perfect tablet for kid easy to use and a great size
3508,fire is slow when surfing web i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store
3509,work good still ha buffering issue otherwise no problem

3511,bought kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch video bought gb microsd card loaded video and install apps there a the device only ha gb ram internal this kindle ha a known issue with not regnizing the microsd card sometimes which requires pulling the tablet out of the drop proof case a pain removing and reinserting the sd card until the tablet regnizes it time nsuming and frustrating amazon doe not seem too ncerned with fixing this issue it is minor really video playback is fine but web surfing on the child is profile for educational site is slow sluggish not a fan of amazon is ad all over the place and their app store is limited for the price hard to ask a lot it ll serve it is purpose

3514,great price and value fast processing many game and user option available
3515,like that i can send and receive e mail and do general office work and use for pleasure and research
3516,i have had lot of tablet in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this wa written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device run an android type of operating system amazon put it own spin on the operating system i do not feel like i m using android this feel different to me it doe not have the same level of customization that android user have me to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device ha been tailored to be your ntent entertainment machine it is simply a fun way to nsume your magazine book etc there are on screen button on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately take you to your home screen the button to the left act a a sort of back button it also let me get rid of my keyboard when i do not need it on screen but it is open the button to the right is super important it took me a uple of day to realize what it doe that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it let you switch between apps but it also let you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the rner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device ha several menu that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet me with several apps pre installed such a slik amazon is own internet browser audible good read the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such a twitter facebook etc you can mbine the apps on this page into folder you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device setting this feature doe not necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only change the font on your main screen if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issue it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new item the device me with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new item when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photo you can do this through the setting menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photo however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon is photo app which is a cloud based app so far i have not found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photo from my phone into amazon is cloud just so i uld view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photo on this device i just wanted a few pet photo on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be book video game shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screen are connected to your amazon acunt for example if you have kindle book you have already purchased they automatically will appear under the book menu your magazine and newspaper subscription will appear under the newstand menu there doe not seem to be a way to change the order of the menu page that bug me but it is not the end of the world there is also one menu to the left of the home menu it is the recent page it show you what you have received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite feature of this tablet is amazon is on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it think you might like the item do not unt against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory start getting full you cannoturn off the on deck feature if you do not like it i have been ntent with the video playback capability this is not my major use of the device but the image look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speaker later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine ntent through the newstand i have tried magazine on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazine with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor is office i always have them one of my regular magazine includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my acunt to the device this allows me to download the back issue of the magazine for a long a i have had an acunt my other magazine didninclude a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it wa an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazine that you cannotry free for day on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazine on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doe not me with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instruction to do this it is not difficult to do if you re fairly mfortable with technology it probably took me minute most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i uld have them wa to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no line between the letter on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through key but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it wa a pretty easy problem to solve so i cannot mplain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device mpared to my other gadget but that generally doe not bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device is not bad if i mpare it to my fancy phone it is not a shape but when you think about the price of this device mpared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speaker are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wonsay that they are fantastic they are not in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphone etc this device wa not made for taking picture it ha a front and back camera but they are not designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hand i think that is partly because of the size and partly because it feel very slick also i do have some hand problem similar to someone who ha carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it is simply fun to use the tablet there are weakness that me with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon service if you do not typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you
3517,for the price the tablet work well the biggest issue i have had is the battery life length the battery seems to not last a long a my previous ipad mini
3518,very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving a a gift to a family member or friend
3519,alexa do something welme to the new internnected world circlers do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice mmand this may be for you do you feel that technology is driving our life more and more toward the dystopia of david egger the circle and you want to escape from technology for a while then likely not a even though you have to touch the button on this unit a opposed to the always on echo and echo dot your life is still connected to alexa via voice prompt i liked using it for amazon music and the occasional amazon video but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an uber some people may feel they need technology to run their life i am not quite there yet and may never be it is fun for what it doe though and it is a good bluetooth speaker
3520,the lady that helped me wa very professional and knowledgeable she understood what i wa looking for let me know that she would have to order it she did just that and it showed up day earlier than originally told
3521,very good tablet for kid i bought a few and gifted them to kid of my relative
3522,so easy to use grandson love it nice starter tablet
3523,this this work awesome with my hue light system i set up my weather and news to get daily info the one minor trouble is that you have to make sure you anunciate so it doe not misinterpret you

3600,we love our amazon fire tv we get all our favorite show and movie it work perfectly
3601,i think this tablet is better for simple usage not so much for a whole lot of apps and game a the memory is used up super fast for only being gb when in reality you do not get the full gb to begin with i got this for my yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there is not enough memory for it to fully function you pretty much have to get a memory card for it with atleast gb or more but for a starter and for basic stuff checking social medium etc it is fine and for a starter tablet for kid

3637,great deal for a handy tablet i have no mplaints
3638,i really enjoy the kindle fire it is easy to use and fast
3639,love this alexa great sound technology ha me a long way
3640,this is a great device it is ultra light and a pleasure to use it also ha a very satisfying premium feel the price of urse is not worth it unless you can afford it there are cheaper model of the kindle with similar screen resolution but if you can afford it i highly remmend it
3641,bought this for my rd grader when her school suggested to parent to get a tablet they use them occasionally in school this inexpensive one fit the bill just fine
3642,simple to operate for a yr old would remmend
3643,it wa purchased primarily for my nephew to assist him in his upming schooling

3646,bought online black friday and had option on lors avoided hassle in store and had prompt delivery
3647,you get what you p ay for and more for this tablet i would only go with a kindle or an ipad and who want to pay time a much when kid are hard on thing
3648,for me it is too small i would prefer it to be
3649,i am very pleased that i wa able to purchase this a a gift for my daughter
3650,i have more fun with this thingâ i m much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news because alexia is nstantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go there is no pairing required so i simply call out her name and she responds there is always a battle between me and my teenager trying to outshout alexa instruction so we can hear the music that we like best
3651,i love the fact that i can expand the memory the image is much better and faster than the stick
3652,my five year old son love his amazon fire tablet it wa well worth the purchase price
3653,if you do not want to pay the extra for the smart tv add a amazon fire tv to your tv and you will have a smart tv great for the price
3654,easy to use for kid and elder very basic function
3655,good mpared to other system like roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background
3656,this is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite not sure is worth the premium though while faster than paperwhite it is still way le responsive than an ipad it is very hard to type on it when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance i like the navigation area on the edge of the screen but i m not crazy about them i m not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that mfortable while reading in bed i guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely i previously had a paperwhite which got lost and i thought i d better buy the latest kindle now when i bought the paperwhite it ha been an experiment a i m not an avid reader and i have a hard time reading paper book since i got surrounded by gadget i actually read few book on the paperwhite and i enjoyed it so when i lost it misplaced it i wa longing for it a i had few book i wanted to read if this would be priced at least cheaper i think it would be a star proposition like it is now it is a tad too expensive for the spe and the shortmings closer to it would be a sweet price prefered buying at bestbuy over amazon a the loyalty program are better v nonexistent and i also used a mover upon
3657,my paperwhite died so i went with the voyage and i m loving it it is basically the same a the paperwhite with the addition of sensor on the side to turn the page if you do not want to swipe the screen and of urse faster processor etc
3658,i chose the alexa with the better speaker and sound since it will be used to listen to mucic can browse a multitude of station and various style of music
3659,i had been using a kindle fire hd for a uple of year but over time found i wa mainly using it for reading i had been nsidering switching to a pure ereader for a while but wa not nvinced until i saw some spec on the voyage i ordered it right away and have been very happy with it

3803,best streaming tool i have seen and used
3804,from the minute you turn it on there is advertising the o is very different from a standard tablet o i uld not get an app that i wanted from the google play store it just would not work on this a i said before i found the amount of advertising just ridiculous

3809,mpact and very good for the price good picture and sound quality
3810,the text is sharp and paper like in well lit nditions when using the backlight in dark nditions it bemes le paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on light can set on automatic brightness level or manually set slim and lightweight when not using a case which i appreciate most about this kindle make for easy holding and carrying packing practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device i also like that it ha page press which is outer press button for page turning one n is it not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store though it is the fastest kindle yet i would not say it is to dollar well spent over the paperweight in fact i would remmend the paper weight when it me down to price im just someone who want the best of the best so i bought of these one for my love a a gift then i went and bought myself one it wa a well recieved gift and i aquired major browny point we give them thumb up we can read together in bed in the wood on the road or wherever we like this is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go i would give it if that wa an option

3820,this tablet is your best deal for the money since it u an adaptation of andriod made by amazon it is technically possible to install google play app store without routing the device if you read a bit online making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight absolutely remmended
3821,i recently replaced a xiaomi mi box with this fire tv box and it been nothing short of excellent ntent availability and flawless performance it just work great should have bought this in the first place instead of cheaping out with the mi box

3832,it should be easier to print off highlight and have a choice not to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight it should be easier to erase all highlight regular book number should rrelate with location easier to forward through chapter
3833,improved over the hd thing set up differently but not hard to learn also a bit heavier than the so reading in bed a little harder
3834,if you want fast menu and stable streaming avoid the wifi only firestick and get this firetv if you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you do the work of running an ethernet cable this box with ethernet is head and shoulder better than a firestick firestick stream well most of the time but sometimes it struggle and you get error with either directv now or p vue forcing a device restart very frustrating this box plugged in with an ethernet cable stream perfectly on the same network with the same ntent of the time i eliminated nflicting frequency used ghz frequency have a great router fast internet i tried everything the cure wa this device hooked up by ethernet cable the fact that you can put kodi on this box open the whole world of movie up to you you can also load android apps from your phone to the device with appsfire i put blue iris on my firetv if have two of these in my home now one in the master bedroom and one on my k tv there is not a ton of k ntent yet but you can go to youtube and see some amazing video in k there when i buy a new home at the end of the year i plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television i cut the cable mpany off year ago and have never missed them other than internet i pay a month for p vue and along with kodi i have everything i uld possibly want and more goodbye cable tv
3835,the paperwhite model ha a very clear screen and backlight so i can be used in most lighting nditions the manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of my only mplaint is that it includes a usb cable but doe not include a charger in the box luckily i had a number of appropriate charger that work well with the reader mpared to the more expensive model the paperwhite had the functionality that i wa looking for at a reasonable price

3954,the paperwhite provides backlighting so that it can be read in dark environment it still ha the same long battery life a the original the software is pretty much the same i gave up the whispernet capability in upgrading but have not missed it much since i always have plenty of unread material already downloaded over wi fi

3968,still learning all that go with alexa i also appreciate the email update on the product

3981,i bought this tablet because of the price and the spec seemed fine but it is slow it freeze and crash i dont think it wa a good buy
3982,so far i only see one flaw that bother me no volume ntrol built into the remote the device is very fast easy to setup and use though it doe offer prime video stud right up front but a uple push of a button and your on to your netflix or hulu or what have you work great with plex a well

3988,price wa right great tablet for playing game and reading

4130,love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you
4131,love the kindles this wa a gift and a great value i have one myself
4132,this tablet is not a high tech state of the art speed demon but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use the two biggest benefit to me are that it now me with alexa built in and you can download amazon movie to the device to watch offline for example on an airplane these two feature alone make it worth the very reasonable price
4133,to date i have experienced issue i m a rd cutter and amazon fire tv ha helped make that possible
4134,echo performs well when she understands the question asked i find myself often repeating question because alexa doe not get it right
4135,i have both fire tv and the fire stick the fire tv is way faster than the stick
4136,this e reader is perfect it is user friendly hold a charge for uple day which is oerfect the size is very mpact i carry with me everywhere
4137,i bought kindle fire for my grandson who is i have one and he thought great can do so much on it for the price you cannot beat it i use more then mputer
4138,work great we love it i would remmend fire tv to anyone
4139,i m an avid android user however you d be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range the quality of this amazon fire tablet is really great it is not hd but that doe not matter to my year old who u it to play game and listen to music it ha extremely robust parental ntrols allowing parent to set a child profile and then set screen time limit bedtime and limit ntent available the child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion a i think my year old uld handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon ntent and kiddie game only overall i am very happy with this purchase
4140,thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that last enjoy the ease of navigating the apps good picture and sound
4141,the medium player is mpact and low profile the remote is nice the unit remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it this may be due to the fact i am running kodi i do have a first generation firestick with kodi that doe not freeze up like this unit the performance difference between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion
4142,i have had my fire for year at least and love it bought this for my mother her ipad died she is enjoying it her only issue is there is a game she cannot download because it is on google play
4143,i found this ver to be quite handsome in appearance everyone who see it mments on how ol or how nice it is very simple and very functional it is very easy to attach the kindle dx to it and the fit is perfect most importantly it appears amazon ha solved the older problem with this ver somehow damaging the kindle if one opened the ver from the back too far now there is a small magnet embedded in the back of the ver that gently keep the back ver snug to the kindle dx and serf to gently remind you with a gentle tug if you accidentally attempt to open your kindle backwards for me it is an elegant and well thought out solution
4144,very durable ver take the abuse that a year old give it
4145,i bought one last year for my year old granddaughter and believe me she love it she deal with it perfectly we put a gb card and downloaded music video and movie and she find everything a few day ago i bought another for my twin grankids they are only month old but we are going to start putting their music and movie with the bluetooth they will enjoy it i got a free in store set up so their mom will learn how to use it
4146,this product work a advertised wa very skeptical at first but am happy with my purchase
4147,it is super lightweight and ha an adjustable backlight for easy reading in dim to dark area and it not hard on eye i love that there is no glare so reading outside is always on my to do list it is not only good for reading but finding book a well with goodreads it ha medium connection like facebook to find what people you know are reading downloading book is quick and easy i just wish i would have spent the extra money on the nvenience of free g it also ha child function to make sure your child is reading daily and appropriate book available for them using freetime they can even earn reward for how much they read overall very remmended for anyone
4148,excellent price point for my basic requirement it ha all the feature i need for mfortable reading of online novel and article
4149,this wa an xmas gift for my wife she had wanted a pad of some sort but i just uld not afford an ipad so i looked at the fire a an alternative first the screen size wa just what i wanted send the price wa very reasonable third it had function and capability that were suitable for my wife is skill and need she absolutely love it and i actually got a mpliment on my present giving that do not happen very often let me tell you i will remmend this she is pleased i m pleased what else do you need my son wa able to piggyback off of this gift and purchased her the ver to go with it so it really worked for my family and i made my wife happy
4150,nice built tablet you need to note that it ha amazon store and no google play store
4151,bought this for my daughter for christmas and the u are endless
4152,bought this tablet for my wife and she like it she play a few game check her email and go on facebook high end user would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value
4153,it kept freezing when i first hooked it up i uld not type anything in because it kept resetting after a uple day it started working when i wa ready to return it so i decided to keep it need to be patient with it
4154,amazon fire tv wa quick and easy to set up after signing in with my prime acunt my son wa able to watch a bunch of show and movie

4369,we bought wowwee mip robot for our grandson and year old they do not have ipad or iphone in their home so thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app talked with best buy salesperson who said the app uld be loaded via the app store it cannot kindle fire is included on the wowwee mpatibility list so we bought them each a brand new kindle in order to use the app they had kindles from earlier year but these would not support the bluetooth functionality needed for the robot absolute fail we tried every possible nfiguration adult v child amazon acunts bluetooth on first or off first mip on first or off first etc it never worked at all not even once also tried full factory reset on each device loading the app via a google play acunt rather than amazon kindle acunt google play would not load the app said it wa not mpatible with this kindle device opened a ticket on wowwee the response wa that they have had the same experience the bluetooth on this kindle fails and so the app doe not work with the wowwee robot they admit it fails yet it is still on their approved list so this wa an absolute waste of money tho at least the boy can play some free game we loaded for them
4370,this is a great product i purchased for travel so i would not have to carry my laptop performs well very quick
4371,alexa is nice but it lack a lot of informayion when asking question it is not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the alexa app itself to work still working on alexa so maybe that uld be the reason but i though it would be like siri that you can ask anything

4532,this is a review of the kindle paperwhite launched july essentially the same a the previous kindle paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded dpi screen more memory and storage it is a terrific reading device this review aim to describe both this product and mpare it with the other kindle device available to help you choose the best one for you before i start ive noticed several mplains about kindle not supporting the epub format used by canadian public library dont be put off there a solution in the frequently asked question section below this review is broken up into section so you can skip the le interesting bit if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start and a frequently asked question section at the end summary what can you do with it read a book it can store is of book take an entire library away with you on holiday buy a book you can browse the amazon kindle store and buy book over a wifi connection borrow a book using the kindle owner library you can borrow one of book if you have amazon prime membership share your book using amazon family library to link two amazon acunts and four child and share your book with the entire family highlight a section using the touch screen you can highlight a particulary interesting few line if several people highlight the same section that is also indicated rerd a bookmark to me back to it later read a book on your kindle ntinue on your smartphone or tablet mputer and it will jump to your last known position look up a word and rerd them in the vocabulary builder track a character appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature read for week without needing to recharge typically week share you book multiple kindles on the same acunt or family sharing access every book you have ever owned on the cloud available for download within sends over wifi or g what device are available a of july amazon have the following kindle device on sale kindle around cdn kindle paperwhite th generation dpi launched october around cdn new kindle paperwhite th gen dpi launched july around cdn kindle voyger around u doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada kindle fire or lour tablet mputers at around cdn so you re faced with a few device plus additional option which to buy here is a quick summary in order of st the entry level kindle an entry level black and white e ink book reader it ha a inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousand of book and a battery which should last around week a terrific device to read book and a worthy ntender for the technically minded it ha a ghz processor and gb of memory with an e ink display essentially this mean it is a black and white b fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c requires very little power hence the battery last for week instead of hour new kindle paperwhite launched in this is really an upgrade adding a super sharp display with pixel per inch the same a the top of the range voyage the high resolution screen doe provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye but battery life is reduced from week of the original paperwhite to week but still a very long time mpared to the existing paperwhite it also includes double the memory which mean it faster and slicker than before and a new bookerly font plus better presentation of font on screen if you have an existing paperwhite it probably not worth upgrading however if you own a prior device youll notice the huge leap in screen quality ntrast and performance the voyage far more expensive that paperwhite this is thinner and g lighter it ha more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e reader body which make it look more like a tablet and keep dirt from getting caught in the edge the back ha a soft touch plastic finish which feel lovely in the hand and it ha new page press button on the side to turn the page when the button are pressed there a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch it ha gb of storage same a the paperwhite and a similar battery which should last around week on a single charge although it ha the same sharp dpi screen a the paperwhite the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting nditions this mean if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright in addition youll find when you switch off the room light your eye naturally beme accustomed to the darkness to mpensate the voyage automatically softens the light slightly a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device kindle fire tablet mputer the kindle fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindle range similar to the apple ipad mini it ha a high resolution screen a fast processor and lot of memory with a lour screen and a much shorter battery life hour rather than week although you can read book on a fire using the amazon kindle app youll find the kindle with it sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book youll find it produce le eye strain and whereas a tablet mputer is better suited to surfing the web watching video and reading email the kindle is a dedicated book reader device unlike a kindle the fire produce light at the blue end of the spectrum which mean it may make it harder for you to sleep the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back light which is far more suited to reading in bed and it wont for example wake your partner if reading in the dark finally unlike the rest of the kindle range the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while it fine for everyday use it le useful on holiday the kindle range of device are perfect to take away on holiday a they can carry thousand of book and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight what other option do i have having decided upon the model kindle paperwhite voyage or fire the next decision is around special offer ie advert g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with advert on a kindle they only appear on screen when the screen saver is on and are not at all distracting the g option is a more difficult question this effectively mean you can use your kindle to buy or download book over the air instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot personally i went for the wifi model a the saving is nsiderable but it a personal choice of urse if you wont have wifi at home then youll need the g option one point worth mentioning however is if you have a modern smartphone you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindle or indeed any other wifi device can connect to got to setting personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up and you can connect your wifi only kindle while youre out and about nclusion if you love book but your on a budget the original kindle with wifi and special offer is a great option youll still be able to carry thousand of book around with you but youll lose out on the soft white back light and super crisp display of the papwerwhite the kindle paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb dpi super sharp screen finally there the top of the range voyage with the page press button and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness if youre in the market for a tablet mputer then the kindle fire range is worth nsidering but youll get a better book reading experience on the kindle myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air i wa skeptical at first but the kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train and the back light and long battery life a huge bonus frequently asked question q what file format will a kindle reada kindle format azw kindle azw txt pdf unprotected mobi prc natively in addition to html

4533,i bought this for my four year old i have not given it to him yet but i m impressed how easy it is to use and how many apps are available for his age
4534,it pretty ol a lot of teaching it thing but once you get it down easy from there i am able to ntrol the tv hue light and listen to music from any bluetooth device connected
4535,did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value
4536,alexa is fabulous just ask her anything and she will answer right away she can order a pizza turn on your light and order an uber better than a secretary
4537,echo is a fun and useful product still learning all it can be used for
4538,this tablet ha exceeded all of my expectation this wa purchased to replace a year old ipad mini and i uld not be happier this work great
4539,initially we purchased the kid kindle fire for our year old the parental ntrols and time limitation are super easy to set up we have a samsung galaxy tablet that our year old son u but we ended up getting a send fire for him because it seemed very kid friendly and i didnhave to worry about any inappropriate ntent popping up lot of good educational apps and game
4540,we have enjoyed this product especially during the holiday
4541,great inexpensive item easy to use kid love to use it
4542,i love how this one let you download apps the picture quality is also a i do find myself having to unplug it every day to make it start over or it ha trouble downloading especially with live tv apps a for it mpetitors i d say this is still the one to get i find myself having a lot more option with this one so my n are minor but still prevented me from a star rating i believe their next generation will be a tho like i said it is still the one with the most option available especially if you have prime the best thing about fire tv is it let is me download the direct tv app so i ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app it is the same tv and i pay over a le a month now it is worth it just for that
4543,my grandson love it he said his game do not freeze up on this one
4544,easy to set up ha great sound nice to talk too
4545,absolutely love it love the app store and the camera
4546,this is a really good tablet for young kid to play on
4547,i waited a while before going with amazon to start automating my home i had nsidered google home but since i wanted to have multiple room linked it wa much cheaper to go the echo route since the dot wa only each on sale it ha more after market apps and seems to be integrated into more home automation system light tv alarm system etc than google home it is also much sleeker and attractive to have sitting in your living room than google it is a bit of a novelty at the moment but is quickly beming an integral part of our house i wa a little disappointed in the pricing on sale since the echo dot a i mentioned wa only and doe everything the echo doe minus a better speaker the dot doe have a mm output jack so you can hook it up to a sound system or bluetooth speaker so if you do not use your echo to listen to music it wa a little overkill for the price
4548,i wanted to buy it long time ago the price i bought in best buy is good for me of urse the quality is good
4549,this kindle make for a great beginner tablet for a teenager the only mplaint is that it is a little laggy but great for the price
4550,we have an echo in the kitchen and bedroom for listening to music and ntrolling our hue bulb if you re going to do any music definitely get this over the dot we have a dot too but in the office where we already have speaker
4551,easy to use and setup good feature and apps are easy to download
4552,ntrols everything in my home i would definitely buy it again
4553,excellent ereader if that is all you are looking for probably a bit over priced for the casual reader the voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality
4554,good beginner tablet for kid uld use a better resolution screen but overall it is good
4555,video file transferring issue some file appear
4556,this is the possibly the best tablet if you are an amazon store prime centric user but it doe not include the google play store and doe not include most any of the google apps which are stable in the tablet world no google inbox etc for me this tablet is a skip but it is cheap and if it meet your need you might love it
4557,great device and deal specifically for the little one
4558,it work great awesome device a great way to ditch your cable service provider
4559,first bought it day before it went on sale everywhere next store doe not tell you about all the ad offer that me with it and you must pay to disable them performance is slow keypad is slow am typing faster than it can register resulting in lot of typo watching movie is decent but sound uld be better it drop wifi more than i m used to have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that nsistently crash good battery kifre but quite slow to recharge sometimes the key stick and cannot get out of something even with home key must restart thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my year old grandson i got worth of tablet mpared to the look and feel of my old ipad it like i m still using a vcr and everyone else is on blue ray
4560,it a great tablet for child but it doesnt work with google apps
4561,this is a great tablet for the money run fast and work seamlessly with amazon prime membership prime is not required to use this by the way you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment we havent tried to use this for business purpose though
4562,my nephew love their new tablet great christmas gift

4571,setup wa self explanatory it doe not take a genius i have had the echo alexa for nearly a month and love everything about it i have a rather large log home and decided to add the inexpensive smaller version called echo dot to the kitchen to be sure i uld turn the smart light on off dim without having to yell through the wall into the room where the echo alexa is located alexa did work the distance but i had to yell to penetrate through the wall for the light on the other side of the house a a team they both work like a charm there is so much still to disver about echo alexa echo dot and there have been more and more apps and accessory added to the list just in the short time i have had it love it and disver more and more thing about it a people are experimenting and posting thing about it online worth every penny
4572,amazing use for many purpose ask alexa to set alarm play pandora and weather anytime well worth the money i use it even more than i anticipated
4573,alexis is very useful for many different fun apps
4574,fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not a impressed with it other potential capability more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do thing like get weather order item etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess
4575,it is a little slow and the camera is not the best but for the price it is fine
4576,i read often and love this e reader i previously had a nook and liked it but it wa old and did not have night reading option the voyage is light and easy to hold the backlighting is great at night overall very happy with this product for reading

5120,it doe exactly what i bought it for and more worth every penny
5121,looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet most of the one under were not worth purchasing i wa a little suspect when i saw the fire but having owned an amazon tablet before i decided to try it out i must say i wa impressed obviously it is a budget tablet so you are not getting a full hd screen or ipad like performance but it is also a th of the price it definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing facebook casual game and medium nsumption if your a prime member it is a great way to stream all of your amazon video show movie the build quality is much better then other tablet under and it is a multi touch screen not one of the plastic capacitive touch screen great tablet for kid grandparent people with light need or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream amazon video

5130,thank you great product for all age thank you
5131,i bought the fire for my husband who is a senior citizen but doe not use a mputer he love it
5132,santa brought it for our our grandson we got a shock case for it and he play and watch kid video on it every day while his older sibling are playing game on theirs it wa a little money well spent on a kid tablet
5133,i have the apple tv in one room and this in the other both are great box but i must say this thing absolutely fly when watching amazon instant video almost zero buffering time even on k video
5134,best bang for you buck tablet running android but without the google service if you have amazon prime then this will be great for your traveling need you can expand the memory with a memory card and the amazon app store ha plenty of apps
5135,i like alexa device i am using this since one month this is future of mmunication
5136,i have apple tv and this thing is way better i do have prime
5137,bought this at best buy since i had a reward upon so only sent for this tablet short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and i kinda like amazon is new o running on this tablet better than android nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way category are on top and you can swipe right to view them a far a speed is ncern this tablet is good you can jump from apps with ease although installing new apps are a bit slower than on android the apps have installed are facebook linkedin overdrive cnn pandora pinterest skpe all run fine you can even run game on this device game like sky force real racing these game have high graphic run surprisingly smooth video on netflix hbo now pluto tv and youtube look great even though they are not hd sound is just ok my smartphone sound better and the display is good mpared to other cheap tablet on the market that are not ip battery life is good too can go a uple of day without charging with just reading book checking facebook surf the web and gaming already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all i not a prime member but purchase a lot from amazon so this device is nvenient when ordering book and other item this tablet ha been rock solid for the week i have it and it is still shocking to me regarding the price with no mpromise in quality wa going to buy the amazon fire hd but since my last amazon tablet wa lost this make more sense since it is at a price point where you can easily replace it amazon ha really changed the game with this tablet other is review that state that this is only for kid or beginner tablet owner is i disagree with now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market looking at you apple ipad and samsung then this is not for you but for others who need a device to do everyday task just like your smartphone then this is the one do not let the cheap price fool you
5138,i like the e reader on here plus i have all the apps a well

5297,it is wonderful i love it it is easy to watch movie play game and read book
5298,i opted for the echo over the dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker and because i planned to add dot to my environment later to create a system of assistant the speaker sound is not great but it is not the worst i have heard i have also recently disvered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit the echo wa easy to set up and is really easy to use i especially like the ability to create a shopping list although i wish i uld create more than one list without adding apps and to easily integrate my google calendar i m currently exploring other feature and skill for the system some of which are very entertaining and useful one disappointment is the limitation of the near field voice regnition range alexa may be always listening but her ear do not seem to be very good if i m more than foot or one room away with not wall between u she usually doe not pick up my mmands that not withstanding she regnizes mmands very well and is very pleasant to interact with another issue i disvered is that in order for the echo to access your spotify music service at all you have to subscribe to the premium version i can understand that given the current propensity for most online service to find way to require you to subscribe to their premium service in order to really enjoy them however with amazon music you can access the free version and their premium amazon prime version in the area of smart home capability i purchased a philip hue starter kit with a hub and a uple of smart light and wa able to get them set up in the app very easily alexa doe a great job of ntrolling them for u but i am disappointed that the only place i can find additional bulb seems to be online where i have to pay for shipping in addition to tax apparently the retailer best buy walmart home depot etc have not seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantity were exhausted i ll be adding other device a time progress and expect to be pleased with the result
5299,just starting to integrate it with other smart home product but it is already really useful

5304,remmended every day great customer service also fast shipping
5305,endless idea for u especially reminder to keep me out of trouble
5306,i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because review more or le said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friend who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both model now have ppi so the dollar jump turn out pricey the voyage is page press is not always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you do not need auto light adjustment it is been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regret the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it is not hard to change the setting either a you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery wa on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about custom which i may have if i used a third party shipping service

5428,this is fantastic we re finally tapping into the world of smart home however with all the different device brand and apps it make ntrolling all the device a little bit cumbersome so you can either get one brand and stick to it or you uld get this the amazon echo nsolidates and integrates all your device so now you can ntrol all your device regardless of the brand through the echo also the voice regnition is top notch
5429,it broke so quick you get what you pay for honestly
5430,i need a table that had more memory to start with this fit the bill i had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one this make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone

5485,i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku for a year and after trying both the older and the newest version and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disnnecting more than it stay connected the menu layout is very ad centric and push you towards how amazon want you to view their service when the remote work the amazon tv seems sluggish in mparison to the other product i tried after several hour of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another roku possibly the version good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv
5486,i bought this for a gift and the receiver love it it is so easy to read
5487,very happy with the product very simple to set up easy on eye great option when you are on the road
5488,i like the kindle the only thing is there is a little light fluctuation at the bottom of the screen
5489,we purchased this tablet for my year old daughter to replace her rca tablet that lasted a year it is fabulous i m nsidering getting myself one for those long drive when your lap top is too big
5490,again after some time i just use it for music like the google one i started out with but wa unhappy i wish it looked better since it is pretty ugly also the light are on the top so unless your standing next to it your not sure it is actually hearing you speak which can be frustrating from across the room needing to repeat your self over and over it it is better at answering random question then google
5491,i have had one for about six month now an it is amazing so i had to buy another one for my baby girl an she love it also
5492,i bought this intending to use it a a music and video player so i can save battery for my phone we got two one for me one for my child mine work perfectly for what i bought it all my music is on it with no problem i did have to download an app to play my wma file but that wa simple enough my child is tablet is primarily used for app game and i am told it is working just fine

5527,i bought a a gift for my mom she love it it is easy to use she cannotake photo watch movie browse internet
5528,i personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight so easy to handle for my toddler with the increased number of game and apps downloaded on the tablett it slows down in speed that for sure i dislike but over al it is good to have when on the go on car ride or long period of waiting
5529,we bought this for our son and he love it he can read his book and also play game on it

5535,old kindle broke i love the improvement of the paperwhite it is all touch screen the old wa not

5537,i m a huge fan of these tablet if you are not trying to spend a lot of money or if you are not an avid daily user this will easily do all the basic necessity
5538,seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it the main user is nearly four year old happy with it and get excited when using it
5539,bought for my wife for mother day a she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer and it performs amazingly in that respect we have ipads and regular kindle fire unit the kid but only this one can be read in any light any time of day only star a i m not sure why terribly more expensive than the fire unit but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool uld not be clearer
