ok so i tried the free trial for hulu netflix and amazon this device allows you to ace them all and many others but do not expect much to be free after your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equal to a little le then hulu or netflix monthly fee is amazon offer many movie for this deal but i noticed many movie like new release and a lot of series are not free and the rent price are higher then red box this device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feed it is a bit mplex and you have to down load all kind of thing but the device is made a good a an iphone maybe better i wa impressed with the hardware and the boot speed but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly when i watch anything on it i make sure everything else that feed from the modem is offline

this is a great way to stop paying for cable or satellite tv or at least cut back if you still want cable without paying for their equipment this item still doe not support the twc app but doe support fox go sport that is why it doe not get star
nice size function a expected use it for reading book email and a bit of web surfing like that you cannoturn down the screen brightness for night reading took off one star because it is tied to the amazon store for apps and you cannot easily edit google doc spreadsheet a you can on an android tablet
love this little tablet my year old will leave my ipad alone now apps work great and sound is awesome
me and my son love this thing and we use it all the time to turn the light on and off in my house we have a lot of phillips hue light the only thing i do not know why this thing will not change the lor of them but it will turn them on and off and set them at a low and high brightness

the product is great once you download everything you need i found it a little challenging taking it from place to place it must connect to wi fi to work and be loaded with the music you want to hear it is great for your favorite spot in your home or office then download song and do not move it
we love the amazon fire tv the k definition is great easy to use

this is my rd kindle and we are very pleased with the ease of use and feature amazon ha to offer i suggested my brother get one for his kid and he too is happy he actually u it a much or more than his kid do if you are looking to buy one i suggest buying a case to help protect it from any bump or bruise i lost my st gen kindle because it wa dropped without a case
seriously a flawless portable smart multipurpose gadget add this to the incredible flash sale price and i d have been a fool to pa it up fast charge balanced tuning easy to pair and did i mention highly portable the cradle is a sweet design too the only beef i have is that your bluetooth is paired screaming at you when syncing own one of these

i got rid of cable for this and trust and believe it is worth it
i got the amazon echo for my parent since my dad often ask u to look up thing on our cell phone i thought alexa would be a great substitute in our absence i love the easy setup and sound quality my dad is still learning how to navigate and at time get frustrated with alexa not having a response to his many question however keeping up with grocery list and dr appts are great for them amazon rerds what you ask which seems to pierce one privacy i m sure it is for programming purpose since it is ever evolving but beware what you ask alexa because she ll remember
i already had the amazon firestick the firetv is faster and even better
it is by far the best piece of electronics i have purchased ok to an extent better than siri and asking for any song to be played at any moment you are thinking of it is amazing
for the price it seems like a very good tablet i wa disappointed that it came with absolutely no instruction so if you were new to tablet you uld find yourself at a mplete loss a to how to set it up
i have had my kindle paperwhite for over a month now and i absolutely love it the screen adjustment to match the room lighting is great and it is much faster and responsive than the older kindle my wife ha it is so lightweight and mfortable to hold one of the best part is the battery last for week even with heavy use
bought of these for of my nephew and they love it keep them occupied for hour at a time a they explore the feature it offer especially all of the free game they re able to download and play wa a better gift for my lil si who now get a break while the tablet babysit i like the sleek design the quality feel of the material the sharp graphic beautiful lors and fast response of the tablet also for the price not many others are mparable setup wa not a easy a some i have had in the past but we got it done would definitely remmend this for anyone in the market for a cheap but quality tablet

i bought this because we wanted to cut the rd and not having any real knowledge of how these thing worked i bought this and played with it for a while and now i uld not live without it the only limitation i have found are the mpanies network that do not have apps i would remmend this to anyone looking to cut the rd
it work
i m not sure who need more experience alexa or me after one month the echo ha been a little fickle at time it is providing excellent service in answering question and there is other time that it doe not understand the question maybe it is how we re are asking or it is not programmed to be intelligent enough more time will tell all in all we re having fun with alexa
cannot beat this tablet for the price great for reading and basic game perfect send tablet for taking place without worrying about all the thing that can happen to your more expensive tablet
this is a fantastic pad for anyone my absolute favorite sturdy access so easy and i will always give it star
this item is one of the sweetest thing i have ever brought
i became a fan of alexa from day i play my favorite music use the alarm check news and weather and even ask alexa to tell me a joke one of my best birthday present
limited apps screen not a easy to touch good for the price
work great and kodi is totally worth the price becaus you save a lot on not having to use netflix anymore
first off the tablet is so do not go in expecting it to be on par with the latest ipad for the price you pay though you get a really good tablet screen is a little lower than p but you have access to all of the kindle book amazon prime the new fire o which look alot better than the all black on the last few kindle fire is this model is only gb but storage is expandable i have a gb micro sd in my tablet remmended
i have had my echo for a few month set up wa easy the voice regnition ha been excellent alexa hears and responds to all of my request a well a the tv occasionally i love it capability to connect to other speaker via bluetooth and it is a lot of fun for the family and party
good speed mpared to the other model just the size and weighs very little large viewing area for a tablet hd
i love my new kindle i would remmend this to everyone it ha so many feature and love the size
with a high functioning wifi and an amazon prime acunt you have all of the personal functionality of a pad of i my kid use them bang the heck out of them and they keep on ticking they have destroyed ipads so for a kid at home it is very nice borat
i m enjoying my new kindle paperwhite so far everything is perfect
the kindle fire is a major upgrade from the original fire my kid and referred to it a an ipad when it wa first received
it is hard to give a review cause it is stuck on amazon home screen it might be a good product but i do not know
the kindle fire is fabulous i have kid age to that utilize these device every day so they get lot of use and wear and tear we have not had any problem and amazon customer service is top notch
purchased a a gift but i do have the echo if the echo work like the echo it will be great
my wife absolutely love her echo and she would remmend this product to everyone
paired this with a bluetooth keyboard and now i have a very mini laptop i also have a first generation kindle and even that one still work perfectly my daughter u it
i bought this for my dad in his late is mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library i set it up for him and he love it i just do not like that it ha ad on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them
this is the best ereader in the market the battery last a least week with one charged
this make for a decent tablet for a kid with the kid edition but i m not sure i d want it a an adult there are much better tablet on the market but since it is cheap that is to be expected
the resolution and ntrast are great and unlike multi use tablet this performs great in direct sunlight with the adjustable light it is also great for pitch black room the battery life is also better than any tablet you ll find i cannot imagine going back to paper book ever again not only because of the nvenience of the kindle but kindle book are always cheaper than their physical unterparts i love this thing
love alexa she truly is a personal secretary thumb up
i did not know what to expect when i bought this but after getting it home and experimenting it wa very helpful and my eight year old love it there are so many thing alexa can do only limited by your imagination we love it
love the sound quality and ease of use and setup it is very informative and helpful
i bought for a and year old grand baby and it so easy to use for both of u
this wa the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted size wa not too big or too small you can carry it without it being clumsy to drop
great tablet but low internal storage and doe not allow for much customization of the home screen and other screen
the fire tv from amazon work great i have cancelled cable tv and am watching movie news football and etc via sling and the fire tv take some getting used to but i would highly remmend if you want to save money on your cable bill and still enjoy tv
the amazon fire tablet is great for our daughter ha actually started reading more
my new fire tablet is easy to navigate i have had two other brand and my fire is the best
nice tablet for the price screen is very clear tablet make amazon prime more enjoyable
santa brought this for my almost year old for christmas santa would have rather brought her an apple but st for one is too crazy to spend on one child so this wa a good alternative and she love it she mainly u it for game and youtube video i think the graphic are great for someone her age great starter for child
i bought the fire stick first then returned it to get the fire tv and let me tell you it wa worth the exchange
work that is all that unts
i wanted to buy the echo for my husband and he love it we love to ask question and play music in the future we want to connect our device that are mpatible with alexa
i got it for my kid and she love it the amazon free time and prime well worth the money
i got this tablet for my nice i really like it but i really dislike the fact that you have to be sing in into store in order to use apps
so far it is really ol if your big on amazon shopping also alexa understands what i m saying alexa is always getting better every week love how it play music for me when i want it to great by amazon get one
decided to try the amazon fire to replace our cable tv since i m already an amazon prime member for other reason this wa only a one time expense for me it wa a very good choice the amazon fire ha given me the flexibility to watch what i want to watch and when without having to rerd and monitor what i rerd on the dvr with the amazon fire i m in ntrol and not the cable mpany even with adding hulu sling i m still saving each month
great device i use it to answer question look up information play music for alarm to take note and for weather update i would remmend this device to my friend and family
santa brought three of these tablet to our boy and they absolutely love them what an incredible product and you cannot beat the price point perfect for the little screen time that they do get and i love that i can ntrol what they have access to you can even set requirement for reading time in order to unlock the ability to play game great tablet
this tablet is so much easier to use than my fire it is great for reading or eatching movie
nice tablet love reading book on this kid profile option is excellent
i have had a roku and apple tv and also used an xbox one to access service such a netflix the amazon fire is the best i have used so far simple clean attractive interface very responsive since i m an amazon prime member it made sense to look at this when it wa time to upgrade love it
amazing product i bought one for me and wife we read alot of book so perfect and the selection is great book a must buy
love the paperwhite no glare easy to hold the built in light is also great for night reading i had the kindle app on my galaxy tablet but never used it because of the glare
the light and white page allows me to read in bed without disturbing my spouse
the kindle fire is a phenomenal item i bought for child year ago now and she cannot put it down great alternative to ipad
regnizes any voice including our grandkids no training required much faster than surfing the net for info amazon provides great capability cannot wait to add gadget
this wa a gift for my mom she love it work great
i had no idea that this device would be so much fun to use it is not an ipad mini but in many respect work just a well it is the best i have ever spent i wa able to root this tablet and install a custom rom which make this even better it nice to know that you do not have to spend a fortune for a big name brand device to get the same quality android experience
if you need to read a review about this product you have been living in a cave
work great for everything we want our daughter to do
easy to use providing many option and ability for add ons really great
this tablet is a good started tablet for child
my send alexa i refuse to call it echo this little toy wake me up every morning and together with her little sister help me avoid burning my food stay up to date with news play my favorite music ntrol hue light remember thing and read i slowly grew attached to alexa and now it is a part of my life that i probably cannot live without the one thing that i do not do with it is shopping sorry amazon and i shop a lot i find it cumbersome and unintuitive perhaps you can use it to reorder thing that you are already familiar with the sound quality is good enough every morning alexa play some upbeat music to jump start my day it is not a good a my ue megaboom it lack bass granted not that many people would expect audiophile music quality from alexa anyways the problem with alexa is still it rather disappointing app selection both quality and quantity but i guess the few good one still imo justify a purchase my advice is to get one and try it out for a uple of week if it grows on you keep it if not say bye alexa wonbe sad at all
excellent for streaming tv thru internet make an excellent alternative to cable tv
this tablet is great for a kid or it is amazing in quality for
love the quality and price paid for this tablet i use it whenever i m taking the bus
this is a great tool we use a alarm and bluetooth all the time
doe not pick up wifi very well apps take longer to download however regular software apps work great
not for the average mputer person very nfusing instruction i spent several hour trying to install the overdrive so i uld get e book from the library ran the battery down several time with no luck i got so disgusted i had to just put it down i m still trying because i refuse to give up thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too
bought these for my grand child for christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their tablet and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet
great product would definitely remmend fir other
i bought this for my granddaughter so she uld have it to watch movie and play game she love it and take it everywhere she go it is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her
the echo wa originally purchased a a gift for my wife and i that did not work well a i have not seen it since my wife u it to get ready in the morning she love to ask her the weather so she know how to dress and love to have her play music a she get ready all without going to her mputer she can also asks for store hour and phone number she seldom is interested in technology but ha told me that i can purchase another one for me yes
i got this during black friday for a great price i know this is essentially their older tablet but it still ha a decent processor and ha a micro sd slot for cheap expandable storage in short it run great and i set up a child is profile for my son so he can play the apps we added for him and do not have to worry about him running up charge etc because of the child profile
picture quality is great and wide variety of feature
i did get this on sale right before the holiday i wa looking for a kindle with at a minimum back lighting though it doe not solve all of the glare issue it actually made for a great tablet at a very low st price
practical and enomical ok to use fast and good for everyday use
first time with anything like alexa and still trying to figure out all her feature kid love to ask her question but she doe not connect to a many apps a i would like and doe not connect with my apple product calendar music playlist etc wish i d realized that sooner but still enjoy listening to podcasts audible book she ha great sound quality for music a well
my family received this echo at christmas and it is used almost daily listening to music adding to shopping list asking trivia etc we loved it so much this now life downstairs and we have an echo dot in each bedroom
i love the snap on ver that charge the kindle it is also very light
the echo allows everyone in my house to add to my shopping list love it
i like the fire tv because it is easy to use and i can get all my service in one box i also like the voice ntrol feature and the included game the thing i dont like is that sometimes the cache get full and the stream start to cut even with my m nection a faster dual or quad re procesor with more memory would be great
bought this a a gift for my mom send she love it
this work great i read a lot and i needed something that would handle all my ebooks it ha all the other bell and whistle a any tablet but i use it for the ebooks and one game excellent
i wa not satisfied with my purchase but for the price i guess it is ok
amazon fire way surpassed my expectation i have an ipad but wanted something smaller to read my email and view video while i wa at work i m also able to view excel spreadsheet without having to purchase another program battery ha decent power too
piece of mind that the little one wonwonder the world wide web and be exposed to thing no parent want to have to explain
i would remmend this to a friend is anybody with little kid
the tap offer all of the nveniences of amazon is alexa in a battery powered portable bluetooth speaker it ha a hand free option it work well both a a way to take alexa on the road and a your primary alexa device at home the tap doe not sound a good a other bluetooth speaker in it price range it is not waterproof and alexa doe not work at all without wi fi but still pretty ol and heaper than the echo
very versatile device that is nstantly updated by amazon price is very fair for this product
it work very well my nephew love it this is the send one is brought
always worthwhile to have or more
is a great tablet the only bad thing is the lack of space and you have to buy an sd card for extra space
i bought two of these amazon fire hd tablet in december a christmas gift both recipient are happy with these a gift i plan to purchase one in the near future for myself
i love my fire i have always wanted one for when i read

great tablet with reasonable price best one from amazon
i am still learning how to using it i use it for facebook e mail play game on facebook eventually i want to be able to use the camera which i have not figured out yet once do i will be doing a lot of picture taking â º
i own all three of the latest fire tv roku and apple tv out of the three a a pure streamer i d say roku is probably my favorite followed by apple tv and then fire tv however a a multi purpose device the fire tv win hand down and it is not even close the fire tv allows you the most customization freedom and versatility such a the ability to side load apps both roku sand apple tv are locked tight in that regard fire tv also feature a more baked in prime experience the fire tv can be a little slow sometimes and can freeze occasionally more so depending on what you install but overall not a bad box for the price
order two and love them great gift for anybody get case for them
awesome tablet and what a great price would buy this tablet a million time over
love how light and battery life awesome would remmend anyone to buy this device
we bought the echo for ourselves and enjoyed the feature so much we bought several a christmas present the music library is tremendous love having the shopping list a it synchs with the app still some learning to be done by alexa and our preference but overall very happy with this purchase
this wa very easy to order online and pickup nvenient and hastle free
my year old love it ol apps and easy to use
excellent tablet with nice screen i wish amazon would pre install the play store this would have been perfect
run awesome for a good amount of time unfortunately sometimes the device disnnects or asks to be refreshed during that time the remote doe not work and it is frozen on that screen other than that it run very fast and is a great unit the fix for that is unplugging and replugging
i like the camera is good and it is very fast wifi work awesome
work great for the price but it shove amazon stuff down your hroat like the fire tv and is linked to your amazon click buy if you haveit set up that way
this thing is awesome give weather news and traffic plus set timer play music and understands you you can even call people
if you enjoy ntent from everywhere and have amazon prime this is worth it one word kodi
this tablet is quad re cpu and ha plenty of space for you to download more apps
purchased this a a christmas present for my wife and she love it mostly play music on it now but i m sure it usage will expand a time go by
hand down the best i had a nook for year and rarely used it i have already read different book on the kindle and it is a much smoother experience

this is my send kindle i would be lost without it it is so nvenient to just throw in my purse and take it along wherever i go i love it
i have not used the product it wa purchased a a gift
positive not overpriced and extremely user friendly o remmend that user purchase an amazon prime membership if purchasing this item a there are always a ton of free tv show movie book and game included in the subscription price for item are also reduced if not there are occasional free and reduced price item however you have to look for them negative if you do not charge the battery on a nsistent basis there is a chance that the kindle is internal battery will not charge anymore this will require the user to return the item and purchase another if the user keep too many apps open the performance drop significantly the display ha a low resolution and the touchscreen doe not always respond a quickly a a tablet would

store salesman remmended the fire over roku which i had history with stated that you get more with fire what i find is that they are very different in how they actually operate roku is more user friendly while the fire is more tech savvy and can be open sourced to some degree one is good for very mputer knowledgeable on how to manipulate software and the other roku is better at a user friendly interface that is more preditable
this kindle is a huge step up from my original kindle the backlights and touchscreen make navigation super easy
great little tablet inexpensive so easy for taking with you without worry
i love the fire tv box it offer the voice regnition remote and an ethernet input if your wifi happens to be shotty

initially i purchased this solely for the purchase of ntrolling lutron light however after being a friend house for a bbq and watching them use this for music i decided to give it a try to see if it uld replace my sonos it cannot however i have found that i m much more likely to play spotify through this using voice ntrols if i m in and out of a room for a shorter period of time and not near a sonos to hit play too busy to pull the phone out for sonos app this thing ha also beme more powerful a more iot device and service integrate with echo or ifttt there is a tremendous amount of potential give it a try and spend at least a week getting to know alexa you wonbe sorry

have not had this long but so far so good it is nice when you buy a product and it work exactly how it is supposed to
the point of a kindle is to read it like a paper print and this product achieves that i nsidered the higher level product but settled on this a the best value option the product met expectation
we bought this tablet right before a trip out of town and it wa a good purchase eight year old crave entertainment and the amazon fire give plenty of that it is been easy to handle and ha not had any issue breaking down the charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet only the part that fit into the tablet itself and some of the tablet version of apps like neko atsume are not good mpared to the phone version but we are overall very happy with our purchase
it is a great value for the price point of the tablet

have had some fun with it but it really is not very smart and sometimes just plain wrong did you know that all of florida is in the eastern time zone and here i thought i lived it the central time zone alexa doe get the time right though and can share some good information and doe ok with music you just need to ask the right question in the form she understands and then she doe ok
this tablet uld be so much better if the apps actually worked decently the built in amazon piece for prime member is great and work flawlessly but it is not enough to overme the terrible app behavior and untless freeze they need to take a lesson or two from apple
it is easy to install and upgrade love the clarity
now that playstation vue went nationwide i wanted something something for live tv to replace my p i am now able to watch cable tv and ota through an hdhomerrun with no rental fee the picture quality is great and ha a great app selection

bought for my grand daughter and she love it she like to read and this is great for that
i have a kindle paperwhite before and just updated my machine the recent machine present much more clear and reach ppi besides the price is much more welme
buyer beware they say it is free tv it not you have to pay for everything i wish i would have bought this before i cancelled my cable
best reader in sunshine and darkness easy to use and re load
i love these tablet but the charging port are not the best i bought for christmas and my kid take excellent care of them i also do not them touch the tablet while they are charging they have only had their tablet since christmas day and they woncharge i highly remmend getting the protection warranty for this item
wish i would have bought this sooner i would get rid of cable if i uld find a way to watch sport on it but for everything else it great would highly remmend
it is a good addition to the gadget alexa help manage shopping list connects to phone using bluetooth to play music apart from the music on amazon prime alexa ha a pretty good llection of joke and can keep kid at home entertained i plan on purchasing hue range of light that can be ntrolled using echo soon
it an excellent tacky for the price it work well and the picture quality is excellent
not much need for this thing good price but make one wonder if they were on sale because they really do not do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet not impressed at all
i love this kindle faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing page and or book the self adjusting light level work very good in mine having the option on the frame to change page is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead this is the only reason why i do not give it a i love this reader
bought for daughter love the parental ntrol and curfew setting
move a bit slow at time but overall it work good
boy wa i surprised i never intended to cut the rd but after i purchased my amazon fire tv and directnow tv o thought i d give it a shot now i m saving per month have all of the channel i watched on cable and i m saving per month and very pleased
currently enjoying the learning experience we have not dived whole heartedly into the many channel option
not much of a selection for show or movie hopefully change
the amazon echo is an amazing piece of technology the thing it can do are endless and new thing are added weekly just amazing
bought for my year old granddaughter she loved it
tried to use it for and it is doe not work a ebookwhich is why i am not satisfied
the screen is mediocre the processor is good very little storage and you have to deal with ad every time you turn on the screen you can pay to have them removed for that price you can get a better screen more storage and open ecistem that is not tied only to amazon
once you learn some of the invocation it bemes easier to have alexa reply to your mmand request
alexa is very much fun and informative definitely a must for the modern life
now my bedroom tv is the smartest tv in the house the voice mmand make this a breeze to use it hook me up to netflix in sends instead of minute like the blue ray player on my other tv is
it a good laptop by hp keep getting the same hp update message even after update have been installed is worrisome
i originally bought this tablet for myself but my kid quickly saw the appeal and started using it it is been a great purchase and my kid have had a lot of fun with it and the price is really unbeatable
very good tablet at a great price nice size for all application
love it and work pretty good for what i wanted for
better than nook also cheaper if toy areally looking to use a a tablet not the best choice great for reading and basic searching
bought for a friend with basic need money wa not a ncern at all
i am a hardre hardback book reader it is always my preference i always said i liked the feel size of a real book over any electronic book reader boy wa i wrong i bought my kindle on a whim while it wa on sale and i absolutely love it i never imagined how much more i would read on the kindle i have gone through book after book after book while a hardback still sits waiting on my nightstand to finish it is a great size throw it in my purse and read anywhere the light is nice for darker reading situation one of the best feature in my opinion is borrowing book you can borrow one book a month free through amazon is kindle lending library but you can borrow a many a your want from your local library if it participates that is where most of my reading ha me from i love the kindle more than i ever imagined and remmend to any reader especially those like me who swore on hardback real book
this work great and allows u to watch tv movie and show when it is nvenient for u love it
the amazon e is extremely helpful and allows to enjoy numerous thing especially music
great for streaming medium and other online thing no lag since you can connect it with a rd instead of over wi fi if you are having lag issue
new kindle replaced my old kindle that had a lot of book to my surprise the book transfer worked well seems to work surfing the net music sound is only okay
there are so many u for this from shopping online to playing music to playing game this also can be used for homework help
it ha a good sized screen very good wifi receiver overall good product
very good for the price our kid love to play with it
i had been waffling recently on whether to upgrade my first gen paperwhite to the newer one i m glad i finally did the resolution is much better than my old one

this is very functional and user friendly great for kid too
bought for my wife a christmas present she ha early version of kindle she like how little it weighs and doe not need a ver with separate light she also like swiping to turn page rather than pushing a button it is easy to read and ha adjustable font only negative is after downloading a book she ha to search for it rather than it automatically appearing on list of book
amazon did it on this one i love my echo from checking the weather to asking random question i plugged mine up at the store and played with it for min with other customer and employee this thing is a must
overall the amazon echo alexa is a phenomenal product but will grow much more with time there are a few issue but that is to be expected
on christmas eve i went in looking for an ipad a a gift they were sold out and i wa directed to the amazon fire hd the picture quality is amazing hence the hd i watched a movie on it and the picture wa better than my hd tv i have to say i would buy this tablet over an ipad any day and it st le than a fourth of the price
i like the low light mode the extra memory and a great price mpared to the others
good purchase for what i needed it for easy to use
i normally read my ebooks on my phone but my son beoke his tablet and so i gave him mine and bought a kindle for myself i must say that i cant put it down i love it so much
this little speaker ha quickly beme a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kid have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purpose some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it doe the job for our family
this is my first foray into purchasing a reader i reviewed multiple site and opinion before i made a move on this purchase and not disappointed can read anywhere in any light
speaker sound real low not easy to use at allhave to pay for everything
would buy another and would remmend to all aaa
it the best device i uld have gotten for the amount of money spent
i am so happy with the kindlefire i bought the first generation kindlefire i wa happy with it when i bought this new kindlefire i wa happily surprised at how much better this version is i use the kindlefire mainly for watching movie reading book so happy with it

we are unable to connect wifi on this product we have tried to follow the instruction to no avail it is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table
what a great price this one is a lot different from the one i am replacing i personally do not think it is a user friendly but there is nothing that can be done about that i only use it for book nothing else

i wa a long time apple tv user but recently cut tie with the cable mpany and got sling and didnwant to shell out more for another apple tv i have had my fire tv for a few week now and love it i have not really used the voice ntrols that often but it work great i would definitely remmend it especially if you are using kodi
i am very happy with this tablet the worst thing is that my steal it all the time lol
it is a very ol device to have and ntrol home item by voice it is limited to it capability but update to include thing you wish it did like the recent add to calendar reminder and alarm love cutting on my light on by voice beat the clap on lol it doe have a hard time of hearing sometimes and i have to repeat myself and holler sometimes like it my kid
this is an excellent device and easy to use star if you have amazon prime and want to use what is included with prime but if you do not have prime any android tv box would be better at half the st
i should have bought more when i had the chance it is a mpact tablet and good for the value
it is limited to what smarthome item you program it for i have been able to turn light tv and thermostat up on or off using my voice only i m still working on item with ifttt for other equipment to do thing when i get home or wake up i found that i have to slow down when giving alexa mmands a she doe not always understand what i m trying to tell her what to do i had to purchase other equipment just for it to do what i wanted to do i would remmend that you do your homework and make sure you either have everything or ready to buy the other equipment when you purchase alexa
great device when working rrectly every once and a while it get slow with connectivity and the remote ha it day that it doe not work
the amazon fire is a great value for the st it is a nice size tablet to take on the go watch movie and video and check your social medium site and email it is a great gift also even for those who have ipads and laptop very nvenient and i highly remmend it for all age
we are super happy with the amazon fire we are using it more than our directtv quality is good and user friendly
very happy with tablet easy to use hook up to wifi immediately
awesome battery life and readability in bright sunlight screen size and weight is just right to hold it in one hand
from the small design this unit pack big power although the newer model ha an external memory port for sd card that make this even better the amount of endless apps and movie choice if you have prime make this essential you can still order show and movie without prime and many apps are free i would remmend the newer model and at least a gb sd card for heavy user or if kid will be using it to download apps a the internal memory run out pretty quick
love my new paperwhite kindle syncs with my older touch kindle and if i let one battery run down can pick up on the other love the ability to read my paperwhite in low light area which uld not do with older kindle
nice tabket for the money with many nice feature and durable
i previously had a kindle fire which i liked but this is much easier on the eye for reading and the battery last for day instead of hour it is great
the picture is crystal clear the resolution is amazing given the price
originally i bought the stick i ended up giving the stick to my friend because i had bought this a a present for my brother and helped him set it up it is extremely fast so i bought one for myself the fire tv is fantastic for watching anything
the fire tablet work great for what i use it for game email buying entertainment
we are happy with purchasing the amazon fire very easy to use and do not know what we watched without it
this is a great tablet for kid the protective bumper pad really doe help the unlimited warranty give piece of mind a with kid anything will break finally the yr unlimited warranty to amazon for show and movie the kid can watch awesome deal for the price
you cannot get much better than this for the price my only critique is that they might a well have not included the camera because it is useless but if you re using a tablet for the camera than that is already an issue good quality resolution fast for internet browsing expandable memory lot of positive to be found here
this tablet work well for anyone it however doe have a few quirk when trying to read an article it will just out of the blue send you somewhere else but other than that it is fast very clear bright screen
good choice for the price good performance and fast
pleased with alexa finding information easily accessible and fun to gather would highly remmend
i bought this originally for my wife because she is always reading and wa interested in a kindle though wa not sure she uld ever part with physical book she love it now with the family library option available we can all share our favorite book i m looking to buy one for myself and my teenage daughter this week actually oh and my wife ha given up on physical book after this she like the backlight when reading in bed at night and the fact that it last for at least a week on a single charge
i think this model is better than the latest voyage model
i use my echo to check on weather and traffic in the morning while getting ready for work also enjoy the music selection news and sport info
got the tablet for my grandma she wa able to figure it out and she doe not even have a mobile phone not bad for under
i really like the auto on off feature volume ntrol uld be more ergonomic
this little tablet is great for so many thing cannot believe the quality i got for the price i paid
i wish i would have purchased the fire before i bought my ipad mini i would have saved over
work well great sound wife needed a send one for her office
gave it to my grandkids age for christmas and they loved it
i exchanged a highly unsatisfactory insignia unit for the fire i wa looking for a inch screen but went to the smaller size for performance i have no mplaints with the amazon product other than the ubiquitous advertising
wa looking for something decent and inexpensive for my niece got this for black friday and so far it is been great internal memory doe not worry me because it will mostly be used for streaming apps like youtube and netflix i wish the ui would be better but overall the tablet is good enough for what i bought it for
i bought this a a starter tablet for my year old daughter we first bought one just for kid but the parental ntrols didnwork right so i just set up a password on the kindle for anytime it is in use with moderate supervision it worked out great she u it mainly for reading watching netflix and playing game
enjoying my alexa very much a very ol idea that work
love the picture and apps uld be better without the apps that you do not want and add your own
i bought this for my godson and so far he seems to love it he ha downloaded a bunch of game his mom like it because it is tied to her acunt and she wa able to set parental ntrols for specific area such a movie etc i do wish that it came with more than gb just purchased a case and screen protector separately because the kid version is way too much imo
good for alittle one for game and movie picture not so clear but not expensive
love the lor pink for granddaughter she love carrying around her own tablet wonderful product love the safety protective case great unit
amazon echo is are great easy to use voice ntrol
easy to use and very fun use it for my pc speaker and it is awesome
i am amused buy what i know of this and nowrealize much of what echo can do depends on how i research the resource and how much iinput information the bluetooth possibility are something i would like to know more of and how to use them
there is so much to do with the echo that i am still getting to know it everyday i learn and try a new skill great device great price
got my year old his own tablet for christmas easy to use nice size the review made me think twice but got it anyways glad i did take the chance
i just ordered mind minute ago is this the newest edition the kindle some of my friend got this and i heard it is such a great tablet
easy to hook up and use great sound i use this device in many way every day
the only thing that i do not like about it is that the screen is not made to be seen in the sunlight if i wanted to take it to the beach or poolside to read i would not be able to see it in the sunlight otherwise it is terrific
great price maybe too small for those who need reading glass but refuse to wear them during usage of tablet
like using it to play music answering question playing favorite radio station setting timer in kitchen telling joke apps for game are few question to alexa must be exactly worded or she doe not understand the question
got good deal on it from bestbuy off i would not buy it at full price unless you buy a lot from amazon and implementing automation at your house some skill are very useful like dish integration and smart plug etc
slow processor equates to slow internet browsing user i nterface is ok really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watch movie next time i ll just spend the additional money on an ipad mini for my kid
this is only a good product if have amazon prime acunt

we amazon fire is for our kid for christmas we chose these because product review were good and the price wa decent mpared to other electronic pad since having them they have been decent but not great the kid will turn them on to play game and their home screen do not always appear sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded the pad act like it need to re download the game and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pad turning the pad mpletely off doe not always help and sometimes we cannot even get them to turn off when they do work properly though the kid love them they are decent for a st time pad for kid for not a lot of money but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at time

i initially liked the product the work it doe and with the speaker but then with time you feel bored in specific if you are listener of hindi music a the song are repetitive amazon unlimited music doe not hold a very good library of hindi music sendly alexa is probably tuned to answer more of i do not know after purchasing i realized and read more review that google home provides much better answer to query put against it and ha a wide range of hindi music
this is one ol item it doe not take up a lot of space ha a great sound and is like having a personal assistant
this is very different from my other kindle it doe so much more the read book

i would not buy it again the software doe not seem a well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i do not have the same connectivity issue with it that i do with this i liked the feature available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issue i cannot say i would remmend it i have looked at review online since purchasing and have disvered i am not the only one that feel this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing
i bought this because i wa tired of watching youtube and twitch on my phone excellent display sound is decent not great but you can always buy a speaker the negative are it is definitely a fingerprint magnet and the spectrum tv app is awful the app work fine on my phone but for some reason on this tablet it freeze and is unusable all thing nsidered for buck it is hard to be beat

i am a huge fan of the echo that being said this is the last one i would buy the original echo is speaker sound much better and is hand free the dot ha great connection bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system i bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard the sound is not a robust a the original echo not portable no internal battery but good enough when in the yard to at least have music

nice tablet and very fast capable the storage option are way better than the previous model i would highly remmend this tablet to anyone in the market for one
i had no problem with this tablet originally had a cheaper one that would crash every time i went to use it
i am very happy with this purchase work perfect
i like the slick size and the whole voice remote now with alexa you can even ntrol your smart home device i upgraded from fire stick and the interface need getting used to i like the stick lay out
i bought this for my daughter it wa bundled with a solid bumper case and ha a kid mode interface she insisted on using her brother is ipad nstantly not to say there is anything wrong with this product it just wa not for her
it for a gift
better than i thought from a techie guy i m a big geek i have ton of box and electronic toy i even have several google tv which are now outdated i m pretty blown away by this box and the amount of ntent apps available for instance the unknown pluto tv app ha over hd streaming station some of them obviously are not great but it is definitely enough to keep you busy for hour on end some of the channel have an hour or two of programming and just loop over and over again but there is enough ntent on other channel to keep you busy for day if you re looking for the end all answer to cut your cable tv service firetv doe not have thing like live cnn amc and other cable station yet but you uld purchase a subscription for sling tv google it which ha ala carte live tv service something apple is promising to deliver if you have a current cable subscription you can get thing like hbo and netflix streamed to your box if you are already paying for it in your home cable subscription your provider pa through the hbo netflix etc programming through to this box so for instant if you had an outdoor tv tv in an attic or basement you do not need to add another cable box to watch movie it ha all the standard bell and whistle like netflix hulu and those sort of service the box is fast doe what it is advertised i have a ultra hdtv although ultra high definition ntent is scarce these day this box probably ha the most ultra high definition ntent of any other unit granted a lot of those ultra high definition video are of flyover of nature type video if you have amazon prime then you can stream several of their in house show in ultra high definition read more
we have been a fire fan since day one and this one doe not disappoint get it you wonregret it
i bought this kindle for myself last year and it is the best i have spent i hoped that my sister would enjoy one
i have owned a kindle fire hd before and this newer kindle fire didndisappoint it doe the job really well for most thing and the price you pay but do not expect it to be a top of the line tablet
by far the best small tablet for the money that i uld ever find i bought one for my niece three year ago and she absolutely love it a great buy
bought this to lay on the ffee table for quick email check and google search if you are looking for something to watch movie on or simple task then it will do ok not a daily driver for sure
our alexa stopped working so amazon customer service suggested i try purchasing a new adapter it arrived and fixed the problem it wa a much cheaper and easier fix than i anticipated very happy with this product

you really cannot get much better bang for your buck great device a must have

i absolutely love my new kindle i ll never run out of good book to read again best buy had it delivered day before i even expected it to arrive uld not be happier â º
i just look at the instruction buy some cable wire make sure you have internet walahhh
the fire tv ha a lot of ntent especially if you are a prime member apps are easy to install and use
amazon tv work great when paired with the kodi app
i enjoyed reading on my old kindle for many year however i cracked the screen i didnwant a tablet because i like how the reader are lighter and easier to read i read all the review for the paper white it meet all my need and is even better than the first edition kindle i love the higher resolution it is easy on my eye so i can read for hour great storage also
i ive used this for a month now it work great percent of the time alexa doesnt always understand you the mic doesnt hear you when your foot away
it came with loaded advertisement is the only negative

i bought this for my wife is birthday she u it all the time she look up recipe used alexa to set timer hand free check weather and news she is finding new u every day
we were curious about the echo for a while but not entirely sure how it wa supposed to mplement the household now we know in way that didneven dawn on u initially echo and alexis have beme a steadfast mpanion and assistant at the house i d highly remmend it
able to watch amazon prime now on our smart tv easy install and breeze to work
the kindle is my favorite tablet for reading book
i m writing this review after one month is use of the amazon fire tablet model aka fifth generation pro good though not great image quality long lasting battery amazon very good at updating device n not hd though amazon make no claim of it very slow battery recharging claimed quad re processor is rather slow particularly for beginner this a fine device for simple web browsing mmon app use etc camera and photo management are adequate app store is amazon is not google play and processor is much too slow for any kind of advanced gaming update are helpful device did not me with alexa ability but amazon ha since installed an alexa app for it is a reasonable value
great gift cannot wait to see my family is face when they open this on christmas
my grandson love it he wa very happy with it
i upgraded from the st gen fire tv to get k happy i did k look fantastic through netflix amazon
love my mine work great with prime and i have all my best movie
i use this amazon kindle for web browsing social medium nvenient for traveling but camera suck so use your phone for picture
if you want any one you do not care about losing get this it work well with anything you want to do from netflix to reading or browsing the web perfect for travel if you lose it or it get stollen oh well you deactivate it on amazon and your out better then losing a ipad or galaxy tab you brake it oh well out great for kid with amazing parental ntrols built right in
we bought amazon echo for my mother is christmas gift she is not that tech savy and she wa able to set up alexa on her own she love alexa and talk to her all day for mom alexa is amazing
love the size of the tablet for travel it responds to touch quickly and ha a great picture
amazing device i have found so much that can be done without picking up my phone love it you you will be happy you purchased it
good kindle not much different from the other one worked exactly how i expected it to
the echo wa set up easily and very fun to play the speaker is good quality for playing music the timer and shopping list are nvenient feature nice to have one
i love the paperwhite it took me a long time to get used to an e reader but the paperwhite won me over the battery last forever it ha a light so you can read in bed font size is adjustable it is so lightweight and it feel good in your hand great on your eye easy to use you can bring all the book you want with you when you travel i have an android tablet and an ipad and i prefer to read the kindle paperwhite no ntest
i have owned the echo for about a year now and enjoy the feature it provides although the tap doe not have the hand free feature of the echo i like it portability i m able to take it outdoors at home and using the wifi play music or even use the other feature available by just asking alexa the unit is well built and i really like the charging cradle provided
overall very easy to install i use stick on velcro to attach to back of tv to keep out of sight many apps available very clear picture and sound easily connected with one hdmi
we already had an alexa but this one is a great addition it is portable rechargeable and good sound
my year old grand child is loving this tablet she is really catching on to using technology she love this and play a lot of educational thing that wa available to her
got it on sale for great tablet but pretty heavy and thick great for kid
bought the amazon fire to watch playstation vueso far so good
even though it is a little pricy i like my new kindle voyage it look smaller but it is because it is only the screen no button it is lightweight you can scroll and turn page with touch screen press or with physical small button on the side it is automatically adjusts to different light nditions
it is perfect my granddaughter love it she is catching on so fast and learning so much easy for travel and on the go
speedy delivery product wa in good shape and it wa well liked by the user
the product is really crafted for kid n they just glue to it a it offer an array of rich topic apps etc
bought a gift for son based on positive useage of year old echo in my home
i really enjoy the fire tablet the only drawback is the short battery life however for it is a great buy in fact i remmended it to a family member if battery life were better i would give it a star
being the best husband i can be after hearing the wife say she would like a kindle did some research and saw that the paperwhite would be perfect for her reading habit
i originally had a firestick and it worked okay upgraded to the box and it is much faster and no lag definitely buy a keyboard to go with it
it is a good device nsider it low st display is not great plus the amazon version of the o is inferior mparing to android
i love it it is by far way better than apple tv and chromecast
this is the send one i have bought for my kid the each have their own tablet now a a parent i like that i can set limit such a screen time reading video etc you can ntrol everything it can be educational aswell their is alot of educational apps on the device to download such a wikipedia farmer almanac etc patent should look through and disver apps with the kid to get full use of the tablet it ntinues to update regularly
for i uld not ask for more aside from access to a ridiculous amount of book i can listen to music download apps play game watch video take photo rerd video front rear facing camera check email and surf the web although you have to pay for most book video purchase amazon also offer amazon prime for a month free after which make some purchase le expensive you can also tack on kindle unlimited free st month also a month after to download up to kindle unlimited book at a time a for the possible n the lock screen is set a a rotation of sponsored ad which is why this tablet is so cheap if this bother you you can remove the ad for on amazon the screen camera resolution and speaker output is not anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price the glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome but i purchased an anti glare screen protector to resolve that issue with the holiday approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget this would have been the perfect gift for me had i not already purchased it for myself
this is a great tablet for the price will definitely buy again
easier than reading a book i do not know why i didnbuy one year ago
im an amazon fan so it wa an easy decision to buy good battery life for music movie and general web stuff fit my hand size well power up quick screen brightness adjusts to any nditions i would remmend buying in store cause i had to return of them with a dead pixel the one i have now ha been good for several month
love it i would remmend to anyone who like streaming tv
i recently purchased this tablet a a backup to my ipad i find myself using it a much a my more expensive tablet
if you want to read book in an electronic form you cannot beat the paperwhite you can read it wearing sunglass in the brightest sunshine or the darkest room tablet may be more versatile but they are not a easy to read in various lighting nditions
this is a great product i love the amazon alexa must have if you want a smart house
really like reading a paper my eye feel good i put many book inside and easy to read like it
love the kindle easy to use and lot of free book to read
the amazon fire tv is really easy to use and installation wa super easy i have really enjoyed the voice search feature best purchase i have made in awhile
nothing more to say about alexa except that she is great
very good and best for travel reading i really like it and would like to refer with all
step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kid are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablet were notenough for him perfect for kid when ipads are way too expensive for a first tablet
the amazon echo is worth purchasing i wish it uld access a wider variety of music and information
very pleased with this product after downloading kodiak and the exodus add ons since then i have added numerous add ons just like getting apps from an app store it is well worth the st and i have not even bothered to maximize the potential of this little critter yet
i bought this for my daughter during the holiday and after four month of use it would no longer would charge i tried other charge a well and it is definitely the tablet now i have to go through the hassle of seeing if i can still replace it under warranty
i love my alexa i am learning new application every day i really like listening to npr news and to classical music i have ordered plug for light ntrol i am sure i will get into more smart home apps in the future
i visited a friend who had one and i wa sold immediately i love how all your streaming need are in one little box plus it work with alexa i intend to get alexa real soon
i bought this after being an avid apple fan for the last year i had old style two apple tv is and even bought a new apple tv to help with me cutting the rd to directtv after year i switch to using the apple tv with the directv now streaming service after the apple tv would no longer let friend or family airplay to it because of new update or let me load any third party apps i knew it wa time to switch it wa a great switch to the fire tv and i have not looked back i have been able to load numerous apps that are not available on the apple tv such a showbox and kodi my biggest mplaint wa the fire tv remote wa not able to ntrol the volume on my sound bar like the apple tv remote and wa not able to turn my tv or sound bar on or off the sideclick remote wa exactly what i needed i wa able to program the remote to ntrol power and sound level along with change the input on the tv i would highly remmend using the fire tv pro work extremely wellallows rd party app installationmuch cheaper than apple tvallows use of amazon music which apple tv did notns home page is not at visually pleasing a the apple tvremote doe not have volume ntrolsremote is not touch sensitive and ha a very loud click noise when pushing button
inexpensive easy to use good lor light weight
it is a great addition to the family very simple to set up and to program once you understand the programming the set up is great
fantastic better response then siriamazon prime acunt give you mplete ntrol
i truly enjoyed it i had it several month before buying an ipad
mostly good for shopping list and listening to music getting game sres etc hopefully will have real search function in the future easy setup phone app
echo is good for listening to music and quick information great for hand free timer and alarm
we love our amazon fire tv is this is our send one and we use them with netflix and hulu and our amazon prime video acunts they work fantastically and we decided to stop paying for cable a there usually nothing good on when we want to watchv anyway
the kid will have a lot of fun time with game and learning
you get what you pay for it work but is very slow
great entry level tablet for kid easy to use easy to ntrol
alexa is a great tool it is fun to use but the dot ha just a much functionality and seems to hear my voice better the speaker on the echo is better but when the volume u up high it cannot hear me at all the dot can connect to an external speaker via bluetooth or mm and it is a third of the price
got this a a gift for my sister she wa running out of book shelf space this wa the great idea she loved this gift and it ha a light so you can read this one in the dark
absolutely love this echo you can ask it anything and it help around the house
i wanted something bigger than my phone for reading i wa looking at the kindle fire and the regular kindle e reader i liked the paperwhite and voyager but they didnhave the ability to play audiobooks i decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading i can do many other thing with it for a cheaper price
bought this tablet for my fiance daughter after getting it home and set up i decided to keep it for myself great screen and work great with my pair of amazon echo i love it and highly remmend it
very good product i remmend to anyone to buy it
if you love to read or want your kid to read get this device that is it
so far this ha been a great product very easy setup and the remote fit nicely in your hand similar to apple tv remote but larger
so many improvement over previous model love the new page turn feature
le expensive than last year with so many more feature and bigger screen
i like to refer this product for low budget tablet future owner it ha all the feature needed in tablet at lower price good display long battery life good wifi connection better speed
my amazon echo did not power back on after we had a loss of power even though we had it plugged into a surge protector i am almost a full year out of warranty for my echo and amazon sent me this power plug for free and almost like magic my echo came back to life a soon a it wa plugged in with this new power adapter yay we have alexa back in our life hooray
great response time image quality is fantastic easy to navigate
previously had two roku device and ended up switching both to fire tv is interface feel much better and apps seam to respond better on this than the roku
i do not have a smart home but it doe so much more than that i got mine strictly for my own entertainment i have not been disappointed my daughter ha a smart home and i got to see what it did for her while ntrolling her light and thermostat is nice i am happy with playing my favorite song it will give me the forecast a i lie in bed it sang me happy birthday i am still finding all of the neat thing it can do
if your looking for an inexpensive tablet to get you started than this is the one quick set up and easy to use for all your basic need
this is clearly taking advantaged of kindle customer who lack a technical understanding of what it is go to amazon and search ac usb charger many listing starting at two for

i got this for my year old girl and she love it very fast she wa able to figure out the game and how to work with it i have some ncern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kid are using it battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok
i uld not be happier with amazon fire tv i had purchased the fire stick first to try out it a well a fire tv are a breeze to install fast easy and amazing i have the voice remote on all of them and it make navigating outstanding i m using the fire stick on my bedroom tv and the fire tv on my flat screen in the family room the main difference is that the fire tv ha a greater memory capacity than the stick it me with a lot of free film program game unlike the other streaming service music for prime member the option available to kid from toddler to grade schoolers are incredible and include both game and video it allows you to keep a personal watchlist for those thing that are you faves or that you want to me back to at a later date there is so much available with this that i cannot say enough about it it also ha all the subscription service that you cannotest with the free trial that they offer sling hulu hbo starz and much much more that way if you re really looking to cut the cable you get a great feel a to what is out there and how much it will st should you pick a paid service even if you just stick with what amazon offer freely and they add thing all the time you still would only be paying for the fire tv and nothing more definitely a win win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital service with this all you ll need is wifi and a tv with hdmi port and you ll be good to go
this kindle is really light weight and ha an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically very mfortable to hold and read i like that it ha page advance button on both side including the touch screen finger swipe to advance
nvenient to use for music news report and the weather love the hand free ability to adjust volume or to change genre

i love my new kindle it wa a birthday gift to myself best decision i uld have made a lot of bell and whistle i love it because it wa to navigate heck i am doing this review on my kindle
my order came on time and great price this item is a gift for a family member
i didnknow much about the device before buying other than the fun mmercials i figured that it wa internet connected and uld do anything i asked it to i quickly learned this is not the case you are not able to just plug it in and expect it to know everything on the internet it seemed it didnknow know some basic question it u skill where are like phone aps you have to enable each skill in order to use it when you want to use a skill much like an ap you have to remember the specific skill and then include that in what you ask it to do it seems like it doe home automation well and basic function but it ha a long way to go before it is a know everything on the internet
i am enjoying my echo it is more helpful then i thought it would be i am happy with my purchase
very easy to operate and nvenient to travel with
great star every home need one just program it like it work for you

i got this item for a great price i order it in the best buy web site and wa ready to pick up in min great customer service
the box work great it is mpact easy to install and all around easy to navigate the only reason i did not give the full star rating is that my remote keep giving out it will work most the time then it will just stopped i have replaced the battery that is not the issue i actually have to take the battery out and put them back in to some time get the remote working again i am hoping getting the remote replaced will be easy and hassle free
paperwhite kindle is great especially when reading outside in bright light like at the beach or in the backyard patio this is the main reason for getting it no glare
i love it
still learning all the thing it can do but solo it is a nice quick answer system and music player i now have mine hooked to hue light honeywell thermostat and a belkin outlet with a heater nice to have alexa turn on my kitchen light when i m running in grocery
take to many request for alexa to understand what you want have to ask several different way to get most radio station when you ask for rush limbaugh you get untry music station alexa must be sending me a message
very smooth operating system and easy to use for netflix amazon hulu etc
lot of fun great for getting fast fact playing a song or adding item to a shopping list that is on the app on your phone great gift idea

these box are great reliable and you can download what ever you want or need for your viewing pleasure
i own a business in finance and need to read a lot on varied subject the kindle enables me to find referenced book and download them in a few sends i have not tried but apparently you can even upload your own pdfs the font and screen resolution and lighting are extremely pleasant and it is easier to hold than a book i removed star because the highlighting and note taking system can get laggy image are sometimes hard to zoom on and you cannot py paste a quote but overall because of the access and nvenience it offer i highly remmend it
this fast charger get my kindle hd up to in about two hour much much faster than the regular w charger it doesnt hog two outlet when you plug it in this new design is taller and narrower than the old square charger so it doesnt ver two outlet in a power strip it about tall wide and deep it ha a usb socket you can use any kindle micro to usb cable of any length i use the enomical amazonbasics micro usb to usb cable foot with no problem it charge my kindle hd from to in about two hour my only quibble about it is that the two power prong dont fold into the body of the charger for storage a they did with the old version but thats just a quibble

my daughter love her tablet because she can carry it to all place
great ereader light and easy to use only issue is a bit pricey
just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon
small lightweight reader the paper white really doe work in any nditions
i liked amazon fire tv it is powerful and the result is amazing
flip between prime netflix and hulu quickly and easily lot more
i had an older kindle and some of the feature were easier to understand but i do like that i can keep track of the book page if i choose to use that feature in the paperwhite edition
i much prefer this over multi purpose tablet the screen is incredibly easy on the eye i can read it in bright light a well a in a dark room it is easy to hold with one hand plus the ui is very easy to navigate i love the ability to highlight make note and look up definition did i mention that the charge last week after reading one book about page in print i still had plenty of charge left
i love my firebox so much i bought one for a friend so much awesomeness with it
work great with my harmony remote but she is not very smart siri work better for most item
this tablet wa purchased for my son it doe exactly what i want it to do which is play game and surf the web namely youtube great value
i do not want to get too negative on this because it doe what it is supposed to however i m not sure how amazon justifies charging half that and i d feel a lot le disappointed it is nothing like the last generation ver which wa hefty and substantial that thing uld take a beating this one umm not so much pro i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grip it on all four side and hold it very securely no more metal prong slide release gizmo it look quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last one n flimsy the leather is extremely thin and unpadded wonstand up to much abuse scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you ll likely ruin it the actual ver that fold over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate it is about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard i uld bend it in half with almost no effort if i had the notion ver ha no lock closure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model it should have something oh well it is what it is i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so it is not such a big deal to me but i wa expecting more especially for this price
great price work great i have no mplaints about the product i would remmend to any one that love kindle
the best gift for my year old niecegreat tablet
it is great for streaming my show and playing my game like candy crush
much better screen resolution than my inch fire
i bought this for myself on black friday and am very pleased for a fifty dollar tablet it ha a great display and battery life it is capability are below many system requirement of application and game meaning they may not run at all or if they do poorly that is fine for my need a apps game are not my focus if you re buying a tablet for game apps i would remmend looking past the amazon tablet and over to full android o tablet or ipads a the google play and apple app store have muchhh more option in that case it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capability i use my amazon fire tablet for reading searching the internet shopping from amazon and watching movie from my sd card it work great for my need the volume is fine and it doe have bluetooth so i have my bluetooth ear bud connected to them most of the time it is the perfect size and weight and doe not feel budget note the invisible screen for this tablet are such a pain to install and in my opinion not even worth it if you want to protect the screen i would remmend going with amazon is fire case it is very nice quality and the ver flap flip over to protect the screen when you re not using it my point if you know what you re getting and are ok with that you re going to really appreciate this tablet
i returned the item because itt wa not wireless it always needed to be plugged in in order to work otherwise it wa a great product i wa looking for something that uld be taken from level to level a well a outside with ease

i bought two of these for my great grand child i charged them and played around on them before i have it to them and i wish i had bought one for myself everything worked great i think this is a great purchase
i like this a lot for an entry level tablet i am able to watch video and set it up to read book there is some lag at time but nothing too bad i had to add a memory card because the gb is small some apps can be downloaded to the memory card but it doe optimize itself and will create space on the hard drive the ad are only on the lock screen never when using the tablet
this is my third ereader in past year and kindle paper white is my favorite enjoyable and clear reading no matter what the llight is even in bright beach sun or subdued night time reading touch screen page turning and menu are a delight access to kindle store for book downloads and plenty of storage for many book are just some of the great feature

this product is amazing it is so helpful and they update it with new skill all the time i think it is one of my favorite tech product i have ever used
my only wish is that you uld sync a bluetooth speaker to take the music playing on the echo unit to another room
i wa looking at the kindle and ended up buying the paperwhite for the backlighting which work great the battery doe last week a mentioned in the detail i wish i would have waited a few week to buy since they dropped the price

we love it still wanting to find new tool to use with alexa without making monthly payment to do so it doesnt advertise all apps st we got iheart radio on a fixed budget this wa a gift if you uld tell u more we can do i would love to know not tech savy at all i know because we are told we are ha
great hardware i owned the fire stick before getting this it is well worth the extra money load way faster and much le buffering i love amazon prime wish there wa better newer more frequent movie but for being included with all the other prime service it is a deal and the fire tv is the perfect way to access it

this is just a good a a laptop of ipad why waste money on something expensive get this
a must for amazon prime subscriber lot of medium ntent for playstation vue subscriber it is speedy and fast work great noticeably faster than st generation amazon fire stick high quality feel of the remote ntrol smartphone app work grea
i have tried the google home smart device and i have been much happier with the amazon echo it ha a good microphone i can speak mmands from across the room it almost always responds rrectly to my question mmands the smart feature work well and i am very happy that i can stream whatever i want to it a a bluetooth device it is an overall better product than google home but the speaker volume is not high quality at the louder level i do not really need to crank it up that often so it is adequate for me but that might be a more important feature for others overall i am very pleased with this product
this tablet wa an upgrade from the nabi jr for my year old and she really enjoys it there are so many apps book video and it entertains her much more the only thing i would remmend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally
good value ha all function needed and good screen size
a while ago my echo power supply stopped working at the time amazon wa out of the oem power supply and provided me with a replacement from china that one worked but wa bulky and not a good looking a the oem one so i decided when amazon had caught up with back order to reorder a real power supply very glad that i did sleek stylish power supply for my amazon echo work a it should and hopefully will last longer than my previous power supply
it is a tablet that st you get what you pay for it is not more powerful than an ipad but it is in my opinion more durable and is easier to pack when traveling i only use mine to watch video on the road it doe have trouble connecting to certain wifi spot but this ha not been a problem at any airport get the touchscreen lag but once the video start going there ha not been a problem it st le than the price to fix a broken screen on an iphone why pa it up
ok let is face it kindles are not the fastest nor do they me with a quad re processor but they are great for simple reading and light web browsing but for on sale it wa a steal thanks best buy
very nice product work seamlessly very easy to setup easy to down load apps and ha a faster processor you can down load the movie song and other stuff if you connect the hard drive voice activated remote is an added benefit
we bought this for our son for christmas he is it is exactly what he needed plenty of game he can watch video etc but i can feel safe with him using it thanks to the easily set parental ntrols
excellent base model e reader nice to use inside or outside
i purchased the inch device also purchased black ver i played for it and asked if i uld get it set up and wa told it would be more dollar i did not have more dollar so i left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free i wa disappointed i had to get someone else to set up my kindle
i bought this echo when it wa first released and i just uld not swallow the st it is a ol speaker that allowed hand free operation but wa just too much money since then the disunts have been much more meager but it is beme so useful i have smartened up my home and ntrolling my light entertainment system and security system ha been amazing
i love my new amazon fire tablet easy to use and great for all level
this is much faster than the fire stick stream clear every time
we are really enjoying all the benefit of having alexa she greets u every morning with a fun fact news weather devotion read kid a book in the evening she turn the light out play a medley of song to sleep we love prime membership all the great thing it add to alexa and now read she will be added to apple iphone we will be buying more for other floor of our home the speaker quality is also very good we highly remmend you buy one or more

i picked up the amazon echo a few month back i m mostly thrilled with it occasionally the echo fails to execute a mmand like alexa play the sre on tune in it will reply sometimes many time in a row uld not find on tune in this morning it managed to find it after nsecutive error so there are some issue with connectivity but i love the addition of the echo to my home now it is time to upgrade light and thermostat

i do not know why it take long to me on and it go off on me my kid have no problem
this is just what is advertised on the box it wa very easy to set up and use
if you re getting this for a value tablet it is a great choice profile ui is lacking my main reason for the tablet wa to give my kid a tool to use abc mouse they have to be logged into the parent acunt to even use it so it defeat the purpose of having a kid profile
the amazon echo doe is doing what it is supposed too work great
i bought the item for my goddaughter and she love easy to use and durable reasonable price and great feature
wa not sure if this product wa too gimmicky or not but we have placed it in the kitchen and use it all the time still learning about all the thing it can do but we get the news weather listen to our favorite music while oking and ask it some dumb question just for fun it really doe find almost every song you request and i just started a shopping list worth the st

this tablet ha it all amazon offer ton of free apps hundred of thousand of free e book and ton of free game the tablet is intuitive and intelligent i seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite show and reading article book and periodical what i love most is that the tablet doe not place all apps on the device but u the user miro sd card instead for up to gb of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more game apps book and movie that can be downloaded and enjoyed it also allows the owner to share the device with family member delegating each member an acunt personalized and tailored to that individual there is even an option to create child is acunts extra bonus i am able to mirror the ntent from the tablet onto my samsung smart television i will definitely nsider amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchase it maintains a charge for a good deal of time alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it i can charge it in the evening and use it for several hour the next day sometimes two day no one will ever create a tablet that is more nsiderate of the owner end user

the screen is just right for size me w plenty of extra goody from amazon and audible among others the only mplaint is the display in bright direct sunlight requires adjustment to full bright or i d have given it star

awesome video streaming device great picture quality easy hook up out of everything this medium device offer i must say the sound quality get star if you have this device connected to your surround sound you will not be disappointed at all the only reason i gave it star and not is because i cannot connect my hard drive to watch my home family video is the usb slot doe not regnized my home movie on my hard drive or thumb drive

originally purchased the echo for the novelty of it but now find it useful for many thing i have it connected to my ebee thermostat lifx smart light and harmony hub so i can ntrol my a c lighting and tv cannot wait for expanded integration to further enhance the experience
good size for my toddler and resolution is very good
my nephew is going to llege next year and we want to give him a gift kindle suit it well for him to learn and study

very great purchase she give the weather and sport
i bought this a a gift for my mom birthday and she love it the screen size is just right and it really fast for the game she play
truly i should have tried to get a refund i threw out the packaging before i realized how poorly it work this charger only work every third day when held at a particular angle the planet almost need to align for it to charge my kindle mplete disappointment
i got this tablet for my year old daughter and she love it
great gift for my dad who cant get out in the yard anymore like he used to he is not tech savvy but he got used to the kindle pretty quickly
it is a perfect gift for kid and great warranty
love it this is so much better then paying for cable tv there is so much to see you can see and even have to pay extra for it to view movie
great budget tablet a lot of feature easy interface and wonderful picture
easy to use lot of apps so far have really enjoyed
a you have seen in other review this can break your dx but not if you put a little double sided tape at each right side rner always move the elastic band so that it hold the right edge of the kindle into the case against the tape and never never swing the back open if you let your kindle dx swing freely back and forth the way the page in a printed book do when you hold it by both the front and back vers the plastic part of the case will break so do not do that note in other review that some people even without the tape have used this case for month with no cracking of the case i have to assume those people always move the elastic band they might also have been reading with the case flat on a table but if you use the tape and the band you can read in any normal position note that the dx weighs oz and the case weighs oz for some people the dx without case might be suitable to hold in one hand with the case you read with this resting in your lap or against your knee when you lie down or on a table the mbo is a big and heavy a a llege textbook but you cannotell this is an expensively made quality product
very satisfy with this device it doe everything that i want it to do
wanted to bring mputer life to big screen do not have smart tv so this wa perfect
i bought this for one reason and thats kodi it an awesome device for that and with the sd card reader it easy to install and get up and running highly remmended
enjoying my gift amazon and taking it everywhere i go
had to return a digiland tablet that i got for my daughter for christmas and best buy didnhave another digiland so they let me get the kindlefire instead of the digiland my daughter like it all except for the fact that she cannot get the google play game that i have on my tablet
bought this for my mother in law for her birthday loaded it with book and music and made her the happiest lady in town work great a a reader and also for music when paired with a good set of blue tooth headphone
i bought this product at best buy instead of online a i wanted to get in the day i wanted it just the voice activated programing is worth it alone and the quality of the sound i wa using my phone for music and it wa not the best quality and the battery would run out this is a great product a it solves both of those issue and more
perfect for what my year old u this for watching program and playing learning game
good product need a few more thing added on but work very well

it work great with the our new kindle
my son purchased this he is happy with it but say that it ha been updated and the newer one is better
so simple to use my only mplaint is the inability to change the background without going through all kind of step and using a special app i bought it for my yr old son and he love it

this tablet make reading and watching video more enjoyable
i had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but i would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it when the kindle paper white came out i decided iâ ll give it a try i love reading in the dark with it and that it look like the page in a physical book i also love the word wise it help to review word you didnâknow later if you want growing your vocabulary
i returned this with the reader in the same box
this tablet is great for my kid small enough for my toddler to hold and watch movie and play her game
will buy this product at this price range again if needed
i had the fire stick ran ok did what i need to do but wa slow then i got this and it run like a champ plus a big factor why i wanted this wa to ethernet port
bought the two tablet for two of my younger grandkids so far the tablet have held up well my daughter like having the ability to limit what the kid can use the tablet for
in an effort to cut the rd we purchased the amazon fire tv it ha all the apps we needed vue hulu netflix prime obviously a well a hbo showtime and the network tv station apps it is easy to navigate and with a little setup we re cable free would totally remmend
mpact and very versatile really very useful to keep thing up to date

i would remmend this tablet to everyone that want a tablet it is real easy to play game facebook and google
great addition to our home entertainment setup connected up with hdmi and wa working within minute
my daughter love this tablet she drop it and it keep going she cannot put it down
i like this e reader but wish the screen were higher resolution it requires decent light to look good but it is easy on my eye the screen update involve flashing the whole screen which i noticed le over time the advertised month long battery life is just standby time it last much le if you are downloading and reading book
my son and granddaughter love them clear screen and game play is great
this is a great product light weight i wish it ha wifi to download from online
great for thing i need it for and is easy to store and put in my purse
had the roku before this and had a big problem with it buffering all the time this one work much better
best thing that ive ever owned my review is a mment i left in response to someone unfair inaccurate star review sorry to hear that your echo is useless mine on the other hand is awesome just today alone i used it a an alarm clock to wake up turn on the light and music to wake the kid for school check how much gas wa in my tank without going to the car re order toilet paper and laundry detergent for a price cheaper than the grocery store hear the news headline while drinking the ffee alexa made me when she turned on the ffee pot roll a sided die for a dungeon and dragon game with my one kid who managed to avoid summer school pipe music into my home all day order pizza for dinner and get help with the kid algebra homework after dinner we played jeopardy on it after the show aired and used it to dim the light inside and turn on the porch light outside when it got dark and i uldnt get up without disturbing my sleeping baby on my chest who incidentaly fell asleep to the echo playing soothing music she can also tell you fact about everything you probably dont know including starwars which plea the kid tell joke play rock paper scissors and can call you an uber have you tried activating her ever increasing fuctions via the alexa app oh by the way her speaker sound better than the bose speaker in my car so yeah
love these box use them on a regular basis would remend
bought this for our year old boy nice to have a micro sd slot the processor seam a little slow but seems to work sufficient enough for him great parental ntrols
i love this tablet because i uld ntrol my child his time with it it is working out really great
this is a good tool for reading without losing your bookmark
this doe k netflix hulu amazon prime video and playstation vue doe it all and work flawlessly have used amazon fire stick before and there is lag no here with this product
first one had issue from the update that wa loaded upon installation returned and waited several week before buying a replacement seems to work better
the fire interface is much better the kindle fire which ha had problem with email the interface is similar to a smart phone which offer a learning opportunity for novice smart phone user i both this fire for rose because of similar interface and her older kindle wa presenting problem the downside is the ad that pop up when it awakes from sleep mode but you cannot beat the price this unit make a great gift and two of our friend have purchased the fire
is good for the kid the only thing is i have to get a sd card for more memory
performs a described always reliable dependable
nice device i like to use it to read book online
i purchase of these tablet for my grandchild xmas present i loved it so much i will be purchasing one for my self
love it glad i got the one with voice mmand do not have extra speaker so this work better than the dot for me
very easy to use love that you uld talk to it and take you where you want
great tablet for my daughter doe everything she need to do with it and easy set up she love it might be the best present she got for christmas this year
my kid have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablet have started to beme outdated we have since switched to these fire tablet to help extend their gaming while if they have never had a tablet before the speed are ok but im afraid the processing power of these kid version might lag over a short amount of time and they will just beme a picture viewer time will only tell
amazon like to push their ntent and this tablet show that a good amount of ad distract user at time but overall a good tablet for a child to get entertained with
had a problem with my purchase but best buy made it good they are very good
i am big fan of kindle fire this particular one is very good a a basic tablet for e book movie email and anything basic internet wise the resolution is low however movie still look good they sound good and all in all i m quite pleased the only issue someone may have is that it is not an android amazon may not have the vast amount of apps that android do but this is something that can be overme so bottom line goody reader good movie and television application or apparatus and all in all good for the entire family
this is a better option then the fire stick for your main tv the fire stick are good for bedroom but the fire tv ha k and is much faster i like that it can be wired to get the max speed from my internet
i bought for my sister is birthday she really enjoyed it it is very appropriate and fit her
there are not enough function on this tablet but it ha great battery life
amazon mayday functionality is not available and this wa unexpected other service and functionality a expected
great product would remmend it this to others have a great picture
this device i exactly what i wanted also i have purchased the prime membership with amazon which is great for ordering amazon product that give free shipping movie music and tv show check it out definitely remmend it
very handy
easy to u good for young child to u watch move play game read book would remmend to other
so far i m enjoying my wireless headphone and sound great
great value at great for a kid tablet you dont worry about kid breaking an expensive tablet
summary say it all really it work but it not really very useful
my last kindle died right before christmas i wa lost with no way to read my book went to best buy to look at all the different one available found that the voyage wa the best for my situation being backlit wa perfect for the many different place i read car work restaurant and plane
it a good product speed price and apps are apt
easy to use easy to read the screen light weight
the tablet wa bought for a few family member two of which have bought several kindle book but only the price is the only note worthy thing about it if you buy it for buck you have pay another to remove the ad and since this is from amazon there is no google play to get more app selection true you cannotry to side load the google apps but the average tablet buyer wondo this also the battery life is poor mpared to tablet like the ipad mini or other decent android slate i d remmend a samsung tablet or an ipad before i would remmend this unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money
if you own a tablet or smartphone you already have one if you do not one of your friend family will give you one of their three spare these adapter are ubiquitous while they re not all exactly the same they all do the same thing worth about
i looked at the review between the stick and the box i choose the box because it connects to the ethernet
like the fact that it is strictly an e reader wished it wa a bit larger like the fire hd tablet but pleased with my purchase
omg this product is excelent good batery and hd screen love this
best device for kodi work perfetly no issue at all
it ha great picture quality all the application seem to load very fast
this is a nice tablet for the price functional for your basic need
had to buy two for each kid of mine they absolutely love it
great for kid of all age
definitely easy on the eye for long reading session especially when mpared to the lcd screen of smart phone and tablet the only issue we had were that it drop the connection to our wifi network and then wonnnect to the kindle store i do not think it is an issue with my network since all our other device do not have the connectivity issue we had with this
great for night reading no bright light to hurt eye
bought it a birthday gift for my son he didnlike it at first because he is ise to the android system he like it more now that he is figured it out and for the price it is ok
the paperwhite is very nvenient to use outside and inside small enough to carry and great battery life
for the little price i paid this wa a good buy for the kid i prefer the amazon tablet for my kid so they can be more involved with reading
it is ol and work well however i find it sort of stupid that you have to activate each specific skill that you want to use before it will register what your asking
i bought it for my year old daughter and she love it her friend even loved it so much they went and bought them too
for the price this wa a great tablet for my kid they love it
i mainly use for listening to music and it work great to have between the kitchen and living room i wa already an amazon prime member so set up wa extremely easy family like to ask alexa silly question it is a little entertaining
fairly easy to set up and easy to operate some innsistency with wi fi connection but overall a solid buy
this product is great and i really like it especially for kid
purchased the tablet for my month old daughter since i notice that she love phone screen and tablet keep in mind is not intend for kid her age but make sure there is adult supervision plus the tablet cannotake a good beating ton of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting a well without causing any damage to the pink case daughter is teething lol i m a amazon prime member which give access to ton of show and free apps so if you have prime you cannototally take advantage of a full library of entertainment some of the apps are great even for my month old daughter work great to keep her entertained also when she is older i have ton of option to change and ntrol also i get my own side she cannot do anything unless i give her action n average battery life hour top of nonstop use and also wish that there wa a way to lock the screen while watching amazon netflix or any other video app so when my daughter tap in any direction or anywhere that the video would not stop playing
i purchased this box in hope of using it for the new playstation vue service which it did run pretty well it doe everything they say it doe but one of the main issue i had with the original and still have with this is the interface the layout for the main screen and the ad they throw in your face are just ridiculous after using roku for year the nvidia shield tv and the new apple tv i would remmend any of those over this device any day they offer a much cleaner interface and more functionality for the most part except playstation vue
i already had purchased a fire stick because i am a gadget nut and well reason heh i decided to move up a part of a rd cutting drive and this unit really shine with more mpute power and buffering space it doe a really nice job even on fast moving source material i also like the voice input
what a ol device to set timer play music read you the news turn of off light and change your temperature all from saying the trigger word work great
awesome gadget to have in the household even more of a plus when you link it to all the supporting smart device like nest etc
good inexpensive tablet for kid it is nice being able to set up an acunt for kid that limit screen time amazon is underground apps free apps and disunts on ebooks add to the value the only n is the limited built in storage only gb free after you acunt for the system software so an sd card is highly remmended
meet my need for watching hulu netflix youtube
the amazon fire tv is an all around great product for a great price it is a little more expensive mpared to the fire stick but it is well worth the price difference the fire tv offer k mpability and also seems to be a little faster it allows me to watch all my paid subscription it one place such a netflix hulu and even amazon prime without have to use my p all in all i would remmend this product to anyone who ha paid subscription it work well with them and let you view them all in one place
i enjoy echo a it doe so many thing play music provides news weather report and so many other skill i can even check the status of my amazon order
this is my third echo the secret is the array of microphone it hears you over music and in your natural speaking voice very helpful and a good speaker easiest way ever to connect your phone to a bluetooth speaker alexa bluetooth connect and you are done
not long enough for battery life nfusion for amazon app user to be careful if i plan to use in the future
my four year is very tech savvy better than some adult great for shaping her real world experience
i purchased of the amazon fire and i am very pleased not only with the product but the price wa fantastic the child are thrilled and they have found it very easy to operate
the paper white kindle is much better than the original great for reading in any light one of my better purchase
spend the extra money on this v just a fire stick
a greatest gift to me wow it is a masterr piece
home automation is right around the rner with the amazon echo great mpanion period
if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing shopping etc i do not know that you can get a better deal however that is about all you can do we found out the hard way that the fire which we bought to replace a misplaced ipad so maybe we were just spoiled is pretty limited in term of the apps you can download forget about any google based apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the android or apple market place i love amazon itself and do not have any major issue with the product i got for the price i paid i just wonbe going the cheap route in the future hindsight being i should have spent the money to just get a new ipad since that is what we were used to
great tablet for the grandson they love it and it fit all their need for facebook email and reading
i used to be able to find these with fold in prong wish there wa that option but it simple and well made
it is a good a an echo great sound nice and loud but but the button that button i would give this star and buy more of them if it wa always listening while plugged in other than that it doe everything an echo doe it is smaller and due to the battery portable i like it i do but it is not a useful a the echo in the situation i use it the most
bought this for my daughter and she love it it help with her homework and then keep her entertained after fir the price you cannot go wrong at all

very good product and easy to set up i have used it everyday and enjoy it

i m so happy with my kindle it is so easy to order book and it work great to read at the gym
i really like the bigger screen the only downside is it take a lot of power so the battery wear out faster than the smaller kindle
although we have not utilized any of the smart feature we will eventually do enjoy asking question and listening to music entertaining for the family

i like being able to just tell echo to play music or asking for the weather also work great with general question only thing i m not too happy with is it sometimes pick up what the tv is saying and attempt to do something with it looking forward to adding smart device to the house and integrating echo with all of that
good product remmend it to everybody very easy to set up
just what i wa looking for to putin my guest room it ha a good picture
easy to set up great picture love it keep my kid entertained and they love it also it wa a gift
this wa a birthday present for my sister and she had no trouble getting it set up for use i wa happy to find one with gb not an inadequate gb my other purpose in buying it wa to test on a cheap machine just in case a procedure for installing google is play store that wa a success and i got a fire hd for myself
definitely better than my prior kindle i do not need reading light anymore
love the personal assistant function and listening to music and audio book
great purchase very pleased with our tablet
very nice quality product east to set up and use
out of the box this is a very capable medium streaming device able to stream from most all of the popular medium streaming service but once kodi is side loaded and nfigured it is unstoppable
bought the fire tv excited about the k support the first night it refused to load video ntent i uld only stream music now it refuse to load at all it ha mpletely stopped responding to the remote remote feel cheap
great for intertainment very good device effective better than cable tv
faster than my firestick in navagating around and doe not freeze a much
i purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check facebook and watch netflix i wa a little bit disappointed to find out that there wa not a vudu app available i hope that one is in the development stage i knew that this wa not a full out tablet when i bought it but had hoped that since it wa based on android it would have the major android apps
this table is realy nice for starter this table have lot off free apps it is easy to use and u can put in an sd card for more space
if you re already a prime member than this is the streaming device you want to go with with hd k streaming you re set with any selection the apps you use have
it is just what i wanted i love that i can listen to what i want without using my phone
small enough to carry and work fast enough for small job
it appears to be much faster than the firestick i can access movie without it having to buffer
easy to use i am not able to access any music i am looking forward to getting the lighting package
a reader but the processor is not fast react slowly
i have an amazon echo and an amazon dot love the functionality decent sound for what they are i just wanted something portable for outside
the kindle paper white provides an excellent reading experience
alexa can make your life easier and answer all those question you are wondering about when sitting around with your friend and family great to play music also and answer sport weather and trending topic question
talk to echo to tun on my light and set timer all the time
i love that alexa can be ntrolled without having to press any button she ha a decent amount of range that she can hear your mmands from it doe take some timing to get used to her but soon enough you ll being to reap all the benefit of an amazon echo currently i have two wemo plug and phillips hue lightbulb set up to my echo and plan on adding more alexa mpatible smart device i love how easy and seamless it is to get all my device working off alexa it is also a bluetooth speaker and can get very loud i love that it can connect to my amazon playlist or my spotify playlist and can play any song i want that is available i highly remmended it to everyone that me in my home and love to show what she can do
need to be more simpler parental ntorl still need to be better
small mpact great for the beach easy to read in the bright sunlight love it you wonbe disappointed
bought this because it is lightweight and easy to adjust display for in bed reading have difficulty reading physical book a my vision is changed i enjoy using this kindle although i have other reader including nook ipad and kindle hd very pleased with this purchase
an okay reader reading from an ipad mini is better under all nditions except outside in sunlight plus with the ipad you can play game web search etc the kindle library function is not nearly a good a the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your book on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not a great a reviewer indicate a there is still the sun glare on page that you have to deal with although at least you can read with it outdoors the kindle also suffers from a shadow along the bottom of the screen the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the light that are shining upward for night time reading draw your own nclusions a to whether that is good engineering it is worse on some of the device i saw than on others kindle serf the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently get damaged i would never take an ipad to the beach but the kindle is almost disposable in ntrast maybe star is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad if apple ever make their device so it can be used outside without a glare then i do not see any market for the kindle at that point not sorry i have a kindle but for what i decided to buy it for reading at beach it is at the price point where it is not really worth it i still read paper book for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading
i picked up this tablet primarily so my husband uld access his favorite apps while at home without having to squint at a phone screen work great
great tablet for the price highly remmended me with ad is the only downside
purchased this for my son decent tablet but not optimum
bought this for my kid easy to use set up parental ntrols so they do not shop on amazon and it is quick
i love this kindle it syncs without needing to prompt for it downloads new book quickly and the backlighting is effective even at low level so i do not disturb my sleeping husband when i want to read in bed it mpact and lightweight size make it easy to carry anywhere and mfortable to hold
the best ebook reader in the market the text is crisp and i love the backlighting
the ease of use is great the feature are great alexa voice mmand work great very pleased with the amazon fire tv box aa
seems like a good value though i m not sure how much it allows amazon to spy on me major problem doe not connect my wifi at home my android and lap top connect and the fire connects elsewhere not sure if it is a wifi problem or a fire problem will contact amazon to see if they cannotell otherwise i would remmend
since buying this we listen to music on it get information from it we love it it ha a great sound to it we would definitely remmend it
enjoy using it outside so i can ntinue to use my kindle no matter where i am
i am happy that i purchased this tablet because it ha beme very useful when i do my studying and for social medium it is a cute size so it fit in my purse easily the only reason i do not give it star is because it doesnt have the ability to add some apps such a chegg snapchat and among others
bought it on sale for le than buying it from amazon my only mplaint would be that i should have grabbed instead of just one
while it is not perfect and can be slow at time it is a good value for the price
she doe not go a day without reading something on there she say it work wonderful outside which is exactly what she wanted she also ha a fire but doe not work that well for her outside
i love my new kindle fire hd it is a great tablet for all age and easy to navigate i highly remmend this tablet for everyone

easy to use and setup great option to have for kid netflix disney jr pbskids all are available for download
great value for money however the screen lag a bit after input once you figure that out then you just need to be a bit patient
for the money this is most likely the best tablet available this tablet will do everything my samsung galaxy will do i wish amazon had this available before i purchased the samsung i would highly remmend this tablet

we needed this amazon fire tv in order to watch amazon prime on our new smart tv which we also bought at best buy it wa easy to set up and work great but it didnme with a connecting rd and the salesman didnsay it needed one had to make a trip back next day
wonderful e reader i love my amazon fire i travel a lot and i do not leave home without it
the amazon echo is worth the st for the speaker feature alone i love the ease of being able to tell alexa what music to play while i mostly used alexa for playing music my whole family enjoys asking her question additionally the shopping list feature is useful i look forward to learning about the many way we can integrate alexa is skill into our everyday life
if you are fan of io and ipad then you will not like this product i prefer to give it to either kid who want to play and watch video or people who love to read only if they amazon prime acunt
love this way more than the old fire stick so glad i upgraded it wa easy to install and i m once again enjoying my show

i love it work great for what i purchased it for
exactly a discribed love the product i would remmend it
just got this a a christmas gift and it doe not stand nothing to secure it to make it stand you can get it to stand maybe to watch a video but do not touch it it will fall down easily certainly do not stand it and actually use your fire hd with this ver you cannot fall right over i feel really badly for the special person that bought me this waste of money i had already bought my own ver for a lot cheaper that ha more shock protection and that one wonstand on end but at sits securely at a tilt which make it more useful for me the cheaper one i bought on amazon also ha a magnetic closer to the ver stay closed this one doe not not sure how to tell the person who bought me this that i do not like this one at all i ll feel bad telling them and they ll feel bad hearing it bad all around
awesome product for a great price love the reward program
the battery life is not great and it need more memory but the value is pretty good and my kid love it
we got this product for our year old i love the parental ntrols only downfall i have noticed so far is it take a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app wise on the parent login on this product
the speed the great the kindle fire ha a lot of apps to choose from and ha not frozed on me yet once you figure out the parental ntrol it work great with unwanted charge
battery life is great kindle unlimited is lame web browser need work
i have several echo dot around my home but this make it easier for me to carry into a room that doe not have one and ntrol thing around the house listen to the news or music it hold a great charge
it work great for all like to surf on the internet
my son love his tablet that santa got him for christmas
it is really a good product to buy for kid a lot of educational game they cannotheir favorite kid show from youtube netflix etc the ver is really good i m gonna another one for my daughter
i love the amazon fire tv this is a great device
i purchased a kindle for my year old son and he love it a long a the wi fi is working properly he is able to stream video perfectly there is also an option through amazon that allows the user to download video to play later downloading and playing game is very easy unlike a child tablet i purchased for him previously the only negative i would give the kindle is it may not always have the game apps that itunes and google have but i have not heard any mplaints for him well worth the money
son wanted for his birthday it ha been great for music list and information
great little tablet to take with you great for kid
great product for great price a described pleased with purchase
i purchased for reading it ha been everything i have expected
echo is love echo is life and i have to write
love it my kid love it nice to travel with nice picture
great take along and travel size it exactly fit my need
i bought this a a gift for my mother and she loved it
although i did like the roku navigation a little better the amazon fire tv ha given u everything we need to feel good about not having cable anymore we started with one and have gone back to buy more
the price is low because amazon u their add to subsidize the price the actual tablet work well the biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the amazon store there are many android apps available in the google store that are not available in the amazon store i primarily use the tablet for bible gateway dish anywhere play some game read the newspaper and facebook in the future i want to try to use it with my local library
great for ppl that use amazon and amazon product the price wa great to
bought this tablet for my mom who ha never owned one before honestly for only buck this thing is pretty good it can have a bit of lag from time to time but otherwise very nice my wife had a first gen kindle fire when they came out it ol to see how much this amazon ha matured their o
i read all review about the tap so i decided to try it i love it the tap keep me up to date with weather news etc i use it every day
amazon always make a great product long lasting device that never over heat or cut off while in use
i love the paperwhite i can read it in any light without glass i always have a variety of book to suite my reading taste i got a rocketfish wall charger for a great price at bestbuy and it is so much easier to charge my kindle i have been reading for almost hour on the same charge if you love book you have to get one of these my house would be full of book but now i can get book i would not otherwise purchase because of physical space limitation i have over book on my kindle and it take up le space than book many site offer free or reduced price book this expands my reading appetite to other area i would probably not have even nsidered before i love my kindle my only regret is not getting one sooner
very nice size now only there is no google play store so cannot use google chrome cast to watch movie on tv a tablet without a google play store is a disadvantage
great tablet for a low price it ha a lot of bloatware but still worth it
very portable and usable without the eye strain that is part and parcel of using a back lit tablet for prolonged period of time able to read at night without mpromising the ability to sleep later due to the suppression of melatonin caused by the bright light of a tablet a decent ver is a must to protect the unit it is also is easier to hold
love the screen lors and the easy accessible apps and internet
i bought these for my son and i m very happy with my purchase they can do everything on these that they need to do and the price is right in case they drop them in water
decent tablet for an affordable price value value value
it is actually a very good product for a decent price not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use
this is everything the echo is but portable you re not getting the same sound quality but more than enough for the backyard or beach a recent update wa made to give you the option of using the button or voice activated ntrols
great amazon tap you cannotake alexa anywhere love it can do the big alexa can do and more no know issue safer
ask any question about anything including playing music favorite save time by getting information asap
this is a perfect tablet for my year old daughter we were notlooking to spend a whole lot of money since she ha broke two already the only thing i wish you uld change is the home screen you cannot customize it like most tablet but other than that great speed the camera is ok and the battery life is great
really really really really really really awesome
this is so much better than the amazon fire stick for what i use it for
i bought it for reading book and it work very well for that purpose
love it i didnthink i would use it but it turn out i use it all the time
perfect size for me speaker clarity is amazing and produce a great picture
this device ha a lot of good feature once you pay for amazon prime your able too watch a multitude of movie
i m an android developer and a such have owned and operated maybe android device and io device in the last five year honestly the fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablet x it price i find the ui a bit cluttered it take a fair amount of swiping to get where i want and the home screen stretch on a bit with the default arrangement but it a wonderful way to read book check the internet and do general web browsing and since it a major name brand tablet it very easy to find screen protector and case at even five below which fit it perfectly too many cheap tablet are such a small specialized item that you ll never be able to find replacement part or matching case overall one of my three favorite device out of or so
got two for my kid for christmas and they re awesome and also got lucky they scanned to le than advertised price woo
great for smaller kid who are too young to play or get a turn to play on xbox game with sibling
so glad i purchased this productive it use it all the time
the tablet work good good price point would buy again
love my new kindle fire love the reasonable price at best buy
not what i expected i am not satisfied with the product
this speaker ha great sound and is very easy to use
fire tv work even better than the fire stick very fast smooth with little to no buffering
great bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of alexa
got this on sale during black friday great little tablet for the price it is not fast but get the job done
this tablet is exacting what it is an inexpensive decent tablet i got it for grandchild to use for game apps and book from amazon
one of the best tablet other than android out there
great speaker and the sound is great use it every day love being able to use alexa when attached to my network
amazon fire tablet is ol very useful especially for my son playing game downloading free game and ebooks
i liked my kindle fire better kindle fire wa easier to hold and easier to use
i bought this tablet a a replacement for my wife is fire tv hdx a her battery life is starting to decrease a it is getting older unfortunately she wa not happy with it a the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise the next step is which is way too big and ha le hour of battery life and i wa disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it wa not able to dede hevc like the fire tv box we have connected to our television this unfortunately is a show stopper a we cannot view the movie library we have on this tablet we will wait until a newer version me out that is improved
easy plug and play great little addition to the tv experience
smaller size easier to hold and put in my purse love being able to read it at night and not keep others awake
thanks to a knowledgeable low pressure salesperson i wa ready to buy my first tablet this one wa the right price on sale and i have not been disappointed every few day i learn more way to use it besides checking e mail checking out library book audio book it stay charged for day even with regular use i remmend it a an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablet
we have multiple fire stick and fire tv is in our house they are flexible and customizable big fan of this device
we actually purchased this a a christmas gift for our son however my husband ending up keeping it for himself he u it at night to read book in bed
bought for my year old it ha held up to her expectation which at time might be higher than mine a kid show far le patience
just what i wa looking for needed a book that i uld take on a vacation
i have had a paperwhite kindle before and i wore it out i love the paperwhite so much i bought another one it my rd kindle loved them all no better way then to read with the paperwhite and not bother your bed mate
happy with the echo it is a really good device will remmend it to others
i bought one and gave this one a a gift much appreciated and great price
this version of it is harder to use prefer old one
great price for a starter tablet easy to use and able to watch video and read book only downfall is poor external speaker if not using headphone
i bought a few of these a christmas present for my family and they have been a big hit alexa is able to regnize voice from across the room even while oking talking or playing music in the background it is a lot of fun to ask her question and see her response and a she ntinues to grow learn there will be more useful option to take advantage of
amazon fire tv is worth the st for me i watch a lot of show the game ntroller and game not so much they remind me of the old style joy stick game sorry i bought that part it hard to use
i had to pick this up for the deal of the day when i saw it
i got this for my kid a a gift so he uld read book easier and it ha helped a ton
great and inexpensive tablet which meet all my need and expectation
easy to set up and work great right out of the boa

long battery life good screen reasonably fast alexa
fun to work on new task and ask random question
my only knock against this product is my girlfriend u it so much i barely have a chance to read on it
i love the fact i can read in bed at night and the backlight is adjustable so it doe not bother my husband sleeping only negative is it take a few longer sends then i would like to power off
it wa a good tablet really easy for kid with great security
much lighter than my last kindle i love it great value for the price
the fire wa purchased for me for after i had a knee replacement i used it to view and check my email facebook netflix xfinity movie and tv show
i am no longer sitting alone in the basement watching netflix using the kid is xbox connection i can watch netflix upstairs and still remain somewhat involved in what the rest of the family is doing

the fire tv is much faster and more polished i highly remmend it
love the new fire tv i use it everyday to stream tv and movie good quality product
this wa and still is a great price for this tablet newly added expanding expandable storage help with storage issue included ac adapter and cable

this is a great kindle super easy to set up and transfer info from old kindle
have not used it yet salesperson did not sell me the rrect rd so i uld set it up

great item to used can get alot of apps and game
we love our tablet waiting remmend it to my friend
love the paperwhite best kindle yet easy on the eye
if you are not tech savvy know someone who is to be able to get alexa to respond amazon wa kind enough to email me to offer support i m afraid the first question will be is it plugged in i m not tech savvy but i also have some sense
got this a a tablet i would feel ok to lose it is better than expected
my wife and i both enjoyed our kindle voyage so much that we had to buy a send one this is our first e reader and it uld not be more user friendly it work well in all kind of environment and lighting nditions a definite winner
this is a fun valuable tablet we three of u all enjoy game the reading story
great black friday deal love the tablet remmended
had a regular kindle and this one is just a light but with a backlight so it help with night time or train reading when in tunnel a lot faster too a it is newer
great little tablet especially for the price doe everything i need it to do only mplaint is you have to rennect it to wifi again whenever you turn it off and back on and sometimes it wonnnect to certain one possibly due to security setting other than that i love it
i have had my kindle for a few week now and find it very easy to cart around and to read regardless of the lighting situation i m not crazy about the nstant ad for book in genre i m not at all interested in but that is about the only negative i have found so far
i brought the fire tv to get rid of cable i m able to watch all my favorite movie and tv show
i bought this for my niece and she love it work great
i have used chromecast before but heard a lot about it voice remote and other benefit so purchased this one it is good but i loved casting from my browser it doe not have default browser or in app store probably i can install one using adb also it is somehow slower than chromecast and take a log time once it go to sleep i will remend to someone only of someone know adb and can add on apps
this product is really useful got to use it at a hotel
i purchased the amazon fire tv to cut my cable and use it for play station vue it ha worked great it is super fast mpared to the fire stick i tried the roku a well but for this application the fire tv wa the clear winner i liked it so much i bought one for all my tv the roku didnhave a guide menu and that wa a big issue it also work great with netflixs picture quality is great probably better than what i wa getting with cable overall this is going to save me a lot of money and i am not missing any quality or channel
i bought this a a gift for a teen i already have one and love it being able to select a new book to read any time of the day is great i am a library user so wa not sure i wa get much use out of a kindle i have grown to love it many free book are available and you can share your selection with others function allow you to increase font size read it either portrait or landscape great for reading in bed and screen brightness is adaptable can play game on it and you need wifi just to acquire new book you cannotake it anywhere to read your book
doe everything i expected plus thing i didnknow it uld do
i have been using the paperwhite for about year now and this unit definitely beat it the adaptive lighting is amazing and page turn button are quite useful if you are looking for an e reader then this is the one for you
i got the tablet for my two year old son and he love his tablet
nothing is ever perfect i m sure my product ha some flaw in it which i m okay with a long a they do not effect the usage i m happy sometimes take a send to register me pushing the letter but nothing too big
i have no idea why i insisted on paper book for so long this is so easy and awesome
fast set up k mpatible and for more storage usb and sd card port
load of apps available netflix playstation vue hulu etc very useful to setup in a basement with no cable outlet
i wa having issue with the wifi for my main laptop so i needed something that i uld check email and writer post on now i mostly use it to play game and watch show through apps with all of that the battery only last for a little over hour before it need to be charged the tiny charger that me with it is not that long so do not expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it is charging so if you need or want something that is bigger than the average phone screen to watch movie read and check email or read book i think this is a good bet
alexa is ok for basic weather and turning on off a light you have linked on your network she still ha some issue understanding basic mmands and i would love to see skill from major airline that allow you to check flight before you drive to the airport the music sound quality is good and you have to be an amazon prime member to really see value there hopefully in a year it will turn out to be a good investment
i wa using this for a while it wa x faster then my kindle th generation yes gb of ram but the app store made from amazon is not the best so i downloaded the google play store to get the apps i mostly used i only use my kindle fire had for book and reading or watching youtube or the web i m giving the rating star
this is my third kindle each one ha been excellent my most recent purchase wa the paperwhite because of the built in light i really enjoy reading with especially in dark place
we already had a st generation in the medium room and a firetv stick in the bedroom we have the stick to my sister in law which she love and moved the old firetv to the bedroom and the new model to the medium room we use it for netflix amazon prime and plex all of which seem to run a little faster and handle mkv and mp video much better
this is exactly what my wife wa looking for i would buy again
i do not care for the lack of storage or the strange arrangement and naviagation through the software nonetheless it is nice for it price
great item for great price function a expected
from the moment i set up the box i have not had any problem i restart it from time to time being that it is a small mputer so to speak

i really enjoy this kindle it is fun to use and ol
my wife had a nook that she loved but it broke the least expensive one are more than i wanted to spend and i came across the fire excellent price for a android based tablet with the fire o and reader with a simple hack you can install the nook app so you can keep any previous nook book a well a using the amazon book store she love it being prime member she also u it for video
purchased this device for my son and really enjoyed it ended up buying another after a day of using the device pro fast boot time clear sharp display long battery life light weightns add on lock screen inability to remove apps from the home screen can only move them to a folder screen show more fingerprint then say an ipad or nexus deviceoverall this ha been a great device and hasnt had any issue i play game of war on the device and watch hulu netflix for the majority of my use for an ebook is it smaller but doe the job

pro light easy to set up if you have an amazon acunt parental ntrol good use for little one excellent camera qualityns touchscreen can be sensitive at time
the kindle white is an excellent ereader which is lightweight it allows you to hold with one hand with no problem additionally there is enough room on the side to hold with two hand without making page nstantly turn
i had an older kindle that i still love but it didnhave the backlight this one is lighter weight and ha the backlight making it perfect to carry with me everywhere i go so delighted that my husband thought to get this a a christmas present for me to enjoy
for the low price it is very speedy and ha sufficient storage space while it doe not have google play the amazon app store ha most of the same apps or a workable alternatve

this ver is a replacement for the initial ver that broke my kindle framewhere the top hinge go into the kindle the metal on the original hinge system wa too light weight to withstand having the ver fold all the way back on the kindle and after just over a year resulted in the hinge beming bent up towards the frame and it cracked the frame on my kindle i understand this new kindle ver is supposed to have rrected that problembut the hinge system look identical to the one that wa on my old ver i hope that over time again about a year plus it woncrack the frame in the same place again on my new kindle i am so thankful that amazon replace both my kindle and the book ver a a result of this problem i would remend that after about month use it would be wise to remove the ver from your kindle and see if the top hinge is beginning to bend upwards towards the frame and if so contact amazon before the frame of your kindle break where the top hinge insert into your kindle
my daughter love it she love the book that she can read
i do not have wi fi so i cannot use the device i m returning it i wanted something that my father uld use a an e reader i thought i would be able to download book via my mputer using the usb cable you cannot do this unless you are registered you cannot register unless you have wi fi amazon need to fix this this is a major flaw

amazon fire tv is a great medium streaming device i made the decision to cut the cable when sling tv started providing the espn family of channel on it app but the question wa which device to get i wa already an amazon prime member and had a netflix subscription so i needed to find a device that had those apps plus sling and hulu amazon fire tv and roku were the only device to carry all the apps that i wa using and wanted to use i read many review and both device seemed to be good so i rolled the dice and got the amazon fire tv it wa super easy to connect to my tv and home network i wa up and running in under minute have not missed cable tv for a single minute i like amazon fire tv so much that i got a nd unit for another television in the house with a good hd antenna and streaming medium device you will never miss cable best of all i am now saving over month

i enjoy the kindle fire but it is not meant for heavy lifting good for reading book and web searching but amazon app store doesnt have many of the normal apps found in google play or apple app store great value for the price however

the amazon fire tv is a really good streaming unit i cut the rd about a year ago and i have a roku that i also use only mplaints about the fire tv amazon push their service at you if you can get past that it is worth it the wifi connection is not a strong a the roku i have had to basically leave the fire tv upstairs router is upstairs and the roku downstairs when i have tried to use the fire tv downstairs it buffer ntinuously the roku ha never buffered i like both a both offer some channel not available on the other i ll look into wifi extenders so that i can use either throughout the house

it is my first time to buy a disunt product on web it is is fantactic i definitely like the reader if possible i want to buy another one for my friend at such low price
my fire stick is one of the best electric device i have ever bought

i have a lot of thing in my home automated and we use alexa a a part of that i d wanted a portable alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a tap late i ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable alexa which is not nvenient i purchased a dot battery pack and it worked okay but once i dropped and broke it i needed a new solution i knew that amazon had added voice activation so i bought a tap it is great sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi rugged alexa device we can port around outside
easy to set up and durable design free time is a great feature taking parental ntrol to the next level the screen resolution and camera are amazing
these amazon kindle started off great and are only getting better i really enjoy all the new feature the new one have
my daughter absolutely love this tablet it ha a lot of great apps that she can choose from in the app store too she is had no problem with her tablet i have even had fun using her tablet and it is simple to use
the fire is a decent tablet it mostly u the amazon store so you are limited a to some of the apps if you want something not hd to watch youtube or search the net then it is worth the purchase for the price it is a well made product
this is a great product i already had wifi thermostat so when i bought my echo is connected very easily setup for the echo wa quick and easy and i now have light bulb i can ntrol with it also it is a great and fun product
i bought the fire hd casei use it mostly for class work very good would be better if it had bluetooth
exactly what wa expected easy to read portable good battery life ha add which are annoying but do not interfere with reading not idea for reading manga or mics but work well enough

my kid love the kid fire they use it every single day it durable i can put parental ntrol on certain thing great buy
with a great child proof case this wa the perfect tablet to start my little guy off with
simple to use ha it hiccup but for buck it the best bang for the buck purchased for my year okd to replace an older generation model
our tablet is fast and work very well i am pleased with the amount of apps that amazon offer
a great way to start cutting the cable rd might have to buy another
this is my nd fire and i wa so sad when it crashed love my new one but giving star bc the need to update the charger at the bottom it stick and you can easily break the inside i wish they would change that

this item wa so great for our tv streaming need we went back and bought another one for the other tv only down side is the remote is so small it is easy to lose beep alexa tell u a joke
great for my four year old she is able to access all her learning game with ease
i enjoy the my amazon echo so much i purchased a dot for my bathroom
amazing infection by amazon no wonder their stock is going up the roof very addictive
gave tablet a a christmas gift she u it all of the time and love it she wa thrilled to get it i bought the extended warranty so that the tablet would be vererd in case something happened to it her mother had seen it advertised and i bought it on thanksgiving day
it took a moment to figure out how to set it up but once that wa mplete it work amazingly it is a little smaller than i prefer
i m an apple guy but got this tablet because i m a prime member and the price wa right work fine but i think the ipad is easier to use
my kid use these thing daily we had to replace two after about a year one got smashed and the other ha the digitizer die great on trip a they typically keep the kid quiet
this amazon fire tv box is amazing the picture quality is awesome
alexa amazon echo is the perfect personal assistant from to do list to music alarm and so much more i have it on my night stand and the plan wa to eventually put it in the kitchen for the family to use but no she is mine my wife is so jealous lol but seriously great device lot of fun and very useful
i use this to voice ntrol different product around the house it can integrate with light switch and my nest for example
i have not been a fan of anything android but amazon did this one right i have had none of the issue i have experienced with other android tablet and it work great for shopping browsing reading and listening to music
my kid love their kindle it the perfect tablet for adult and kid to share
it wa a hard choice between high priced echo v the cheaper dot but i chose the echo i do like having the speaker internal and i will be able to add the dot later on to other place you can download apps to have alexa more adjustable to you
i highly remmend the firestick to any user great for any age
i picked this one up to replace an older one that had stopped working i like the back lite and it is not a bad size
love the backlight of the kindle paperwhite i would definitely remmend to anyone
i brought this tablet a a christmas gift for my yr old son it is the only present that he is still to this day playing with he love his tablet
great tablet for a beginner i m impressed with it feature
this came with the kindle paperwhite i bought a a birthday present for the love of my life see that review
bought this a a gift so i cannot speak on how it function however i researched all kind of tablet online before purchasing this and it wa a great deal
exactly what he wanted and he is very happy with it no problem
so easy to use and surprisingly good sound use it all the time
crazy that you have to buy these separate for some kindle product that should me with one
it is a positive addition to the household i enjoy having alexa around the house
i loved the kindle fire so much that i purchased a send one for my husband
this product is well thought the kid seem to like the apps
i use this device in my office to stream music and keep up on the news overall a good experience so far
this version of kindle wa not very impressive to me navigating wa easier on my older kindle this model is smaller also i have had an issue with charging on this device since i purchased it when it doe accept the charge it will charge to rather quickly however the battery life dy out so much faster a well at time when i am using i will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is nstantly making a ding noise off and on a the charger connection doe not fit well keep falling out i even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue it did not
my mom loved it user friendly even for the non techie
great for e reading on the go nice and light weight and for the price point given definitely worth the purchase
got this a a gift for a friend she had a little issue trying to set up at first but got it going eventually
got this for a friend a a birthday gift he seen one that we had an fell in love
this wa a replacement for a kindle paperwhite that wa lost i did find the old one after buying a new one and now everyone in the family want it
tablet is great for child is learning game and doe appear to hold up on it is own for quality and strength under close supervision sound is loud and image quality good work well with our wifi price wa great also
this ha to be the best of all amazon product for the television you can store more memory and the rom speed make no lag time on any show after this i will never buy a fire stick again
it wa great product the price which i got it wa great
i would highly remmend purchasing alexa make sure to get all of the update that she is capable of for example you can do sleep sound she will even tell you the weather sport excetera
it is a nice looking ver will keep the fire clean but not particularly safe in a fall i have the black one it is very professional looking no padding whatsoever it doe wake the fire up when opened and shut down when closed but that ha never been important to me my problem with all of the case is that you have to hold the ver out in order to keep the camera clear and it make clicking the shutter a little awkward i d like to see an opening on the front ver that match up to the opening on the back so you can have it folded in half and still be able to view the subject
great little dash cam that doe not get in the way bought two and wa defective out of the box but returned and got another nice lor screen and a lot of bell and whistle for something this small
if you re looking for a tablet to read book surf the internet this is perfect
i m just beginning to learn all the thing one can do with this so far it is great for general info oking timer game music weather news joke will be checking out accessory next a household must have
restricts use of some web page including barnes and noble where i have a library useless to read the book in my barnes library
we only used this for music and playing game with question with the echo now we are using it to automate lighting in the home a fun toy that ha beme a useful tool
biased in favor of right handed person but performs a promised it would be nice if a lefty uld move page with his left hand a a righty can move page with his right hand
i purchased this tablet for nvenience and wa surprised at how easy it is to use and how well it performs it downloaded all my information from my paper white tablet and i wa able to download e mail and other important apps
bought two of these for both of my kid they absolutely love them
it get a lot of use since bought my eye will not hurt a much a using an ipad
wa such a hit had to buy my niece one a well but we re sold out everywhere after christmas
nvenience with alexa is changing my home setting it up with light bulb thermostat audio radio best investment ever
i really enjoy my echo i listen to music audible book weather the news i talk to my mom with it because i bought her one also this had a really amazing speaker it is really great with answering science question and anything you can find on wikipedia the only down side is amazon doe not have a sever like google doe so there are a lot of question you may ask that the echo cannot answer i really remmend this if you have amazon prime or the nest thermometer or any of those smart gadget that can be ntrolled with echo if you do not have these item or prime i would get the google home you can listen to music and book using the different google apps with the echo you can order from prime you cannot link the echo with other echo device yet to play music on all of them at the same time yet i m hoping that will change with time
bought for husband is grandmother work great for her she ha not called for help after setting it up with her
bought for home automation but havent gotten that far yet good for music book weather etc
my bf got me this a a birthday present from my son it is just like my although larger i cannot tell the different between the regular and the hd and i game on it i m not sure if it st more but would not waste the money if it did
i read many review before purchasing i can see why it ha such a high favorable rating the picture is clear and crisp even when not receiving a shd signal set up wa quick and easy i love the streamlined remote i m going to really enjoy this for the superbowl i would definitely remmend this tv to anyone
i really wa not sure if i would like this thing but now i carry it everywhere and have it loaded down with ebooks to read
i have purchased the fire stick in the past now the box doe everything the stick doe and i can expand the memory which is a huge plus for me also being able to plug directly into a cat cable help with streaming
although it is not really a necessity it is truly fun to own alexa is not a savvy a siri but the ability to play any song on mmand and with accessory turn device on and off is worth the expense
i love how this box allows me to mbine my netflix hulu amazon and a bunch of other useful hub in one it is user friendly and the voice remote is a lifesaver no more typing in search box
amazon did a good job with this box the factory andriod allows for plug and use or modify it up
cannot beat a tablet for that actually work
very clear hd video love it and at a wonderful price
i wa not really impressed the remote broke within hr of using it and had to return it
this is a great table for an amazing price it is perfect for reading book playing game checking email etc i would definitely recmend this
we really love being by able to play music with her
extra feature are nice and upgrading from the kindle paperwhite wa fairly simple amazon did an automatic system update which wa not ol there should have been an option to update when we wanted not when they wanted
bought this to replace one i had from about year ago why did i wait so long the newer model bigger screen is so nice and it is so much faster
having the freedom to pay foe what you want to watch instead of a package
ordered multiple product both are great one i have purchased before
i got this for christmas and love reading book on it you get no glare and my eye do not get tired i previously used an ipad which wa too bright and tired out my eye this reminds me of the real paper from a book
the tablet work fine it is responsive with good resolution it is too tied to amazon it requires too many hoop to get apps such a zinio to work until amazon loosens it grip i remmend only at a very good price
bought for kid they stay charged through play all day hr and have been dropped and slammed a few time already but still look perfect and work just like new
made a nice mother is day gift
i absolutely love reading on the kindle paperwhite it is great being able to sit outside and read and not worry about the glare it is very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand
i bought this tablet for my child it is great and me with parental ntrols i would highly remmend this tablet
i wa somewhat disappointed to disver alexa uld not seem to answer what i thought were fairly simple question mileage distance between location etc additionally i wa not mfortable upon disvering the product nstantly rerded nversations
we love this fire box it get all of the channel and even new movie that are still in the theater
bought for my daughter because i love mine so much easy to use can see in the dark to read before bed not so bright a a phone so it doe not keep me up
easy to use and integrate with nest and philip hue i like that new feature seem to be added frequently
what can i say we just love it we listen to the news briefing every morning and music during the day
great product i would remmend have no mplaints
it is not the greatest tablet i have used but it is by far the best value for the money
very user friendly amazing and interesting you have all the help that you can get just by talking to alexa
there are many thing i love about the amazon echo it read me the news every morning news that is tailored to my interest it will do simple calculation or set reminder and alarm but most importantly it interface with my smartthings hub and allows me to ntrol all the light and electrical device in my house a well a the temperature with my voice
cannot beat this lil tablet on value purchsed on black friday so we got a great deal good battery life and the user experience is good too i have had no problem with it and i am happy with my purchase
good screen resolution very handy easy to operate mpact great reading device
i bought this tablet for a gift for my nephew it wa a bargain on black friday i have not heard any mplaints from my nephew yet the only thing i did not like wa the setup it took too long
very easy to set up and to use i have not used the voice ntrol yet but will soon
i bought of these i didnwant to pay the price for an ipad since they were a gift for my pre teen very satisfied with my purchase and the kid were able to get their gaming apps n they take a while to charge that is why i m giving it star
this is how to watch tv via streaming using the fire tv that is also k mpatible love it
the kindle fire replaced my old and broken kindle reader and ha exceeded all my expectation and requirement i plan to buy a in the near future and pa the to my wife to replace her kindle reader
we purchased this tablet for our year old daughter she love playing learning and interactive game this is great
very good product with many new feature each week good learning tool for young child with teaching mathematics history etc
i purchase i f these tablet for my grandchild i wa very surprise iof how great they are i ordered one for myself this is a great tablet
not happy at first a battery wa totally dead when i got it however after charging it is working ok
i had to go through tablet before getting this one which is the best that i have ever had
good tablet for the price it is gonna be a good present
the quality of display is better than expected for the price keep in mind that this is not an ipad apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation very satisfied with the product this review is for fire hd gb
best small tablet for the money good resolution for a small tablet doe everything i expected and more
i want to start out by pointing out that i honestly wa not expecting much to begin with i wa just hoping for something backlit to read with at night my problem with it is that it wa slow to the point where it wa almost unusable just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you re new to amazon fire this is not representative of the experience of owning one
gift for yr old grandson very easy for them to maneuver around great charge life we have to force them to take break
i love the fire tv and have had no issue it is very easy to use and setup
the voyage when it worked wa great the page turn make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp making it a real upgrade from the paperwhite that said it started to freeze up quickly after i got it hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon and the price of early adoption sometimes because overall i uld not be more pleased with the working voyage
so far this kindle work great have used it in the dark and on the beach and have no visibility problem very satisfied
great gift for mother is day for aging parent not too difficult to navigate
this saved me on my cable bill good quality thanks
lightweight fit perfectly in my hand good screen quality make reading even more enjoyable
unbelievable quality for a great price easy to set up and awesome customer support
using it in the kitchen mainly it ha good sound work excellent a a oking timer also alarm for certain event thruout the day nice music source
got this for my niece aged they loved it and so did their parent really keep them occupied
i like than is mpact i can carry on my purse i do not need to worry for book mark and i can be reading book a the same time
i believe it depends on how you want to use it i bought this for my young kid and they are loving it they can do basic stuff like surf the internet watch youtube and play some game the only mplaint that i have is that sometimes it doe not charge even if you have have it connected for the whole night you just have to restart the pad so that it can charge but that is the only glitch
this tablet wa well worth the price it is a little slower than an ipad but not by much work great with clear quality on the screen
there are many apps for the fire box and there are many u the picture is very crisp and set up in a breeze
i think the rd need to be a bit longer this would enable you to read while charging
this is good for traveling light but still possessing research powerful especially in wi fi area
i wanted a bluetooth speaker i am glad i got this i like playing the game and asking it question
about what you d expect from kindle bluetooth connectivity battery life all good
this piece of tech is amazing and functional i liked it so much specially in the morning to check weather news and listen to some music high qulaity and solid
i had researched the product thoroughly and it performed a expected
i really love this product i like to order product why talking to alexa haha
small and easy to use this wa a great value on black friday
great product perfect size and weight doesnt take up much space user friendly
easy to set up lot of great apps to pick from to expand it usefulness great selection of music
the best product that i have ever watched a movie on i love the amazon tablet it is doe amazing thing
great tablet we wanted orange which took a little while to get shipped but came in uple week
i had a kindle and liked it for year the paperwhite is much smaller but with a bigger screen the backlight feature is fantastic
i wa really surprised how easy it wa to use and set up i may be looking to add one in my man cave and bedroom too great device
this is a basic tab i bought this for my sister you cannot really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon acunt and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive but i wa still able to use it for game and internet browsing i had difficulty using it for anything more camera wa not the best
the amazon echo ha beme a critical appliance in our kitchen admittedly we bought the echo to serve a yet another ol toy to have around but we re finding that it is a great addition to our life the top used function for our family is probably the simple to use timer function but a close send is the ability to call on any artist we want to hear with amazon prime music it is well worth a few buck a month to get the music service and the sound quality of the device although not audiophile worthy is quite good our family is still exploring the many great tool available with alexa but i can say without reservation that it is a great device to have for any household
very nice streaming device very smooth and super fast very minimal glitch
my kid like them so much i buy of them and i got a real good deal on them
i love it for my kid they r enjoying playing game and watching kid cartoon
great reader for the price mpact lightweight print and back ground lighting can be adjusted for easier reading some people may find this helpful if they have vision problem
fun to quiz easy to set up still learning all of it is capability
i purchased this mainly for streaming tv since we canceled our cable work great and ha a excellent selection of apps
i love having alexa my fave thing is the shopping list i look through my home and ask alexa to add item to my list so i never forget anything
my first kindle must have been defective a it wa overheating because i bought it at best buy and their return time wa over and not from the mpany all they would do for me wa give me a disunt on a send one i finally accepted and the send one ha worked perfectly this is a good option for a cheap tablet
it is a good kindle for the money to much junk on the carousel
uld be a little smarter and they stopped including the remote with it u gotta buy that extra before it wa free
my year old son love it seems to be well made
like the large screen for reading book and watching movie

little disappointed in item very hard to turn off but it is easier to read
this is a mpetent tablet at a bargain price unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system amazon is take on android essentially remove all functionality that make android great to force you to use their service and apps instead of google is if you re a tinkerer or do not mind doing some software hacking this is a pretty easy fix you can hack google is apps and service back into it resulting in an amazing and amazingly cheap android tablet unless you re willing to do or hire someone to do those software modification you ll probably be disappointed if you are it ll be the best cheap tablet you ll ever own it look like it might be great for kid even in it stock state i do not have kid so i uld not test that but i added a star for that possibility unmodified starsmodified star
the amazon fire stick is mpatible with a samsung television
alexa is a great device to have around the house you can nveniently add thing to your shopping or to do list or get a quick snapshot of the news and weather alexa ha fun feature like playing jeopardy and question the only downside is she is not connected to the internet so you cannot get answer to random question like if you were asking siri hopefully that feature will me soon

if you are a major amazon nsumer the echo should be your first choice spot on the range across a noisy apartment is great and using it with my prime acunt feature are awesome there are quite a bit of skill you can add to increase the function for example your alexa can ring your phone if you need to search for it or use it in an emergency to contact a loved one work great with hue and wemo and i actually use it regularly for shopping list weather and other entertainment news update adore my echo

if you are a hardre reader this is your kindle the light make a huge difference to read under any nditions itâ is a big improvement from the standard kindle if you are unsure between one or the other go for the paperwhite itâ is worth the extra money
this tablet is excellent hard to imagine all these feature can be in this unit for under it is a must buy especially if you have child who like to use your tablet perhaps buy them one of their own for u it is one of a few tablet we own but it is one we are glad to have

i bought this for my daughter for christmas i cannot seem to keep her off of it now what a great buy
i bought this item for my kid for and enjoying lot mpared to other tab this is a great bargain pro it easy to use battery is excellent work for long even while game are being played strong body and very good touch sensitive n screen resolution look little grayish not bright enough which probably is good for kid eye while playing longer
very easy to use kid love it only downside are lack of certain apps and the speaker are weak all in all a great tablet for under
the sound in this is on par with other high end portable speaker that however is really just the tip of the iceberg if you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking also this work if you have phillips hue so you cannoturn the light off and on with your voice
it doe everything any other tablet will do you cannot beat the price the only bad thing is the camera it is a sharp and clear the picture me out kinda of dull but other that great little tablet make sure you get more memory
been a kindle fan since keep getting better i thought the original paperwhite wa perfect however the extra storage and speed are needed and a welme addition
great cheap netflix watching tool for the child
my previous kindle wa dying and i wanted a new replacement fast i went to amazon and while they had one it wa back ordered a month expecting to pay more i went to best buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it wa available at my local store and i uld pick it up the same day

great tablet for kid very affordable great introductory tablet for first time tablet user
i bought this reader for a trip i wa planning i must say it is awesome the size is just perfect to throw in a backpack and the resolution is very good for this pricepoint you cannot go wrong purchasing this
ol new product and it make everything so much easier to just say what i want and have alexa find it for me
i love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glass pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading i m right back where i left off love it capacity is unbelievable
if you are using amazon prime you definitely like this table a it can stream the video audio reading book easy to carry with you
for what it doe it is great for me a good alternative
if you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant then this is the product for you the tap only listens to your when you push the button otherwise it is deaf to it surroundings you get the awesome power of alexa provided by amazon and no worry about anyone listening to you surreptitiously
i bought this for my living room tv work great no issue what so ever
easy to use and great resolution for viewing high definition ntent
i am so happy i chose the echo over the google clear sound listens better than google more knowledgable than google answer all question rrectly
awesome
this is my rd kindle by far the best one love it
an interesting addition to the home easily regnizes speech from multiple source and is able to answer most question it is a bit mplicated to get all set up and to determine what is free and what requires subscription work very well
my daughter love it she u it with ease which make me an mommy very happy no mplaints i would definitely remmend this product to a friend very helpful employee at best buy a well
best speaker personal assistant out there do not buy anything else
my son seems more than happy with his b day gift he love it
i bought this for my wife and she love it she is an avid reader and doe not get much time to do so this wa a perfect gift so she cannotravel with it
love this product will not go back to satellite or cable
great size for my and four year old to handle even with the case case also durable
affordable price the tablet wa a nice christmas gift
wa easy to set up excellent sound quality for the price
decent tablet i knew it would not be fast but it doe get the job done and it wa relatively cheap
i have really enjoyed using alexa and have found it more useful that i thought it would it ha really inspired me to start to use alexa mpatible product to make my home smarter
i love to give my friend and family echo is now i can give them a white one this is my most favorite gift of all time
i have not been able to get alexa to answer most question and it is difficult to figure out how to delete your prior question i think it is more of a novelty and good for playing music but if you think you will be getting great info your online web search is far better this is very basic
truly enjoying this fire my last kindle fire is only year old and work great but want a front and rear camera camera take good picture also like feature of alexia
i really love the back light on the paperwhite i upgraded from an old kindle keyboard with a lighted case and i love having the backlight built in i nsidered the voyage to get the page press feature but am very happy with the touch screen
i had one of the original kindles and gave it to my daughter when i got an ipad a much a i love my ipad it is not ideal a an e reader after a trip or two this summer to the beach with a good old fashioned paperback i figured i d try out the new kindle paperwhite i m so glad i did it is small lightweight and hold a charge for day i love it and have been reading book after book since my purchase
this tablet is great for book audible book music and all thing amazon the included browser silk is not the best i purchased expanded memory gb sd card for about more and a ver for about the biggest issue i have with this unit is that it is slow when mpared to an ipad and it tends to freeze every so often for about x more money nsider an ipad instead
i would of never have nsidered getting alexa until i house sat and the owner had one i love music and she uld play every genre keep in mind you have to sign up for monthly fee it is so nvenient just to ask her to play music and the sound from such a small unit is phenomenal i also purchased the starter kit for the light she will turn them on and off by your request and you can set it up on a timer which is great when you re out of town
i now have three dot echo and am a fan i really enjoy the capability of echo and ease of installation
easy to use ha a nice clear picture me with some good apps
kindle fire ntinues to be my fav device to keep in touch with family and friend internet facebook messenger email movie book music doe it all i m never bored
the echo ha been fun for the whole family it play music and interacts with everyone and the outme is very entertaining
still need more mpatability for thing it ntrols need some sort of access to map
this is my send kindle fire the th gen is an even better experience glad i preordered

i love this so much i bought two also bought one for my parent it is really easy to start up walk you right through the install process i highly remmend
i wanted to upgrade my kindle fire first edition this one is really nice graphic are superb a is the speed in loading i do not know yet what else it can do a i have not explored it thoroughly it is like a mini lap top and ha a camera that take very clear picture and ha wireless connection to the internet
love hd qlty video awsome selection from music to tv show
having had several model of kindle reader i can say that this is the best yet and is definitely worth the extra st
it pretty good for the price my only ncern is the quality of the picture not an hd one my daughter mplain when shes taking pic
it little improved than previous version good deal at this price
super easy to use and very gentle on your eye i have tried many e reader but i ll definitely stick to this one
i am always happy with the product i purchased especially the kindle fire the are reasonably priced i have one is for my granddaughter when she she visit
i really enjoyed this purchase will by this product again
i wanted the amazon echo since last year just waited for it to go on sale i am still learning but i love asking alexa to turn on my music from pandora it is great ordered the dot for my bedroom should be in soon
my grandson is really enjoying this product and it is standing up well to his use
i bought this amazon fire tv to reduce service from my cable tv provider the unit itself is small and unobtrusive a i already have an amazon prime acunt setup and registration were simple and straightforward the unit work a it should it is fast and the voice search work better than i expected i have only had the fire tv for a few week so i cannot speak to long term reliability so far absolutely no problem with the unit fire tv is a great addition for amazon prime subscriber
it is good for small child they cannot get to setting too easily
i exchanged the paper white that i had bought for this voyage this is thinner lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite still getting used to the archive system since i had a nook before bit of a learning curve but i like the kindle interface better than the nook the book suggestion and shopping for book is much better the only thing i miss is that the kindle doe not tell you what battery you have left it just show you the bar in the battery symbol
love this tablet ha all the best feature of a kindle and a regular tablet it is easy to use and doe exactly what it is supposed to do with zero fuss
it a nice tablet for the money but i just didnlike being stuck in the amazon universe
i am very pleased with this product i am able to play radio station from across the untry
this amazon fire ha some nice feature that my old kindle fire hd did not like a camera and microphone for video chat i wish that it keypad would do swiping though i miss that and am not a happy with the autofill on this model overall though it operates well the browser uld be a little faster
bought two of these for both of my niece birthday and they were the hit of the party both love playing with them

i love this product im using it more and more each day with the added skill
bought this tablet for my yr mom so far she is enjoying it and having no issue it is her first one and she is finding it easy to use and learn new thing
for book game and internet it is perfectsound is a ittle weak
amazon fire tv is the best to use with kodi app that allows you to have all the movie without any additional charge
have not figured it out fully yet but can do and answer many thing
my niece wa very excited with the use of this product using it like table and mparing it to an ipad
i wa surprised to find it did not me with any type of charging rds so i had to purchase one and then found my sprint htc d charger is faster i would not purchase again st item i have ever not liked i have purchased from amazon
i have two one for each tv in the house i do not even use my apple tv anymore since i can also play hbo go and nefflix on amazon tv and there are several amazon only show sort of like having another netflix acunt
work great would remmend for anyone looking for a good product very kid friendly
i love the echoi m really enjoying all of it is feature
nice tablet from amazon ha a good screen on it and plenty of memory
i bought the echo primarily for operating my home automation rather than for music i have a sonos system that i use for music the echo work great enabling me to adjust the lighting and temperature at multiple home all from my own home it is great because it internnects discrete system using my wink hub i have lot of lutron casetta wall switch and nest camera and thermostat which alexa can ntrol
bought for lil brother it a ok tablet for a kid especially apps like wwe and cartoon
bought this for my husband he is been asking for for almost a year well it is a great device informative and fun and the music channel are phenomenal i would highly remmend it
i purchased these for my grand kid for christmas to watch kid show on and these were a great price for what i wanted
u good for my family i remmend yo my friend good program good signal
really ol device always finding something new to do with it
hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on
wa looking for a simple tablet to use during my mmute this fit the bill app store is limited but this is good for simple web surfing or watching video lightweight too only thing i do not like are the ad on the unlock screen but this is minor nsidering the price
bought tablet for myself something wanted something for travel and easy to store this wa perfect for my need bigger than small screen phone and smaller than mputer i have had no trouble with wifi or streaming such a hulu or netflix a mentioned for the price you cant beat it
i use this mini tablet at the gym to watch streaming tv and movie show easy to setup take a bit of time to get used to various screen touch screen is a little slow to respond bluetooth connectivity is not automatic i have to try and connect the same device every time i use the tablet overall very good for the price
like the speed the inch screen is great work well
i do not know much about this tablet and have not quite figured out how to use it yet but it seems like a great little tablet for a first time user
we bought the amazon fire tv device to watch streaming tv and it work great love the guide feature
doe the job
i love kindle e reader in fact i had purchased paperwhites over the year the design is absolutely amazing it is my most favorite device for long reading tablet like ipad are no mparison on this i also believe this is the best gift for kid
bought this a a gift for my friend daughter work really well good tablet for about dollar i did opt for the year protection just in case something happens in the year
supera smart always ready to answer any question
have been very pleased with all aspect of the fire hd good performance for the low price
love using the echo to add stuff to my wife and my shopping list turning on and off light in our house and for getting some daily news read to u soon will be adding an ebee thermostat so we can voice ntrol that too
this is a great tablet for the price would give it star if it had included some sort of instruction manual otherwise definitely remmend
i wanted to get my kid a tablet and this wa the best option glad i made this decision my kid love the kindle
great item the sound is good the microphone is very sensitive alexa is good and hopefully will get smarter with more added feature
this wa a gift for some kid in my family great tablet for reading and playing game apps
it is great tablet for the price the only downside it is a little slow at time
great addition to the family room movie on demand and very smooth streaming
this tablet is a great value for the price you can have multiple acunts on the same tablet and pick which apps are available on the acunt for your kid
not much to say here cheap fast and very functional i wa able to install google play store and everything work perfectly best tablet in it category if you want something better you better be ready to pay time the price
didnthink i would use it much due to the my lack of use of siri however this understands most thing i ask and is fun for the family it also doe not responds to question discreetly for thing that kid uld ask example is santa real answer i have never met him
i love the echo but i hate the fact that it doe not have a rechargeable battery i would really be nvenient if i uld take it on the beach or out to a park without having to worry about having a power source with me other than that it is great
this wa an item i bought for black friday because the price wa really low i love it it get the job done great travel item is exactly how much it is worth the sound is low but again for a good inexpensive travel tablet this is a best buy
for this one of the better tablet you can get a it fairly fast and ha a solid display
can use it for best streaming can watch all the show in best quality nice piece of equipment when we have nov
easy to use quick setup fantastic screen and the lors are vibrant
love this kindle it is a great value for the price
so long cable well worth it all you need plus more
between my wife and i we have three apple i pad i purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter it is an entertainment device you can serf email watch movie on line and it make an awesome remote for my fire tv it really pay off if you are an amazon prime member it ha a version of the amazon echo but not quite a the echo or echo dot i love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage perhaps they cannoteach this process to apple after using this i have to admit that i have purchased my last ipad
le lag than the stick ethernet port option is nice not too much need though if you wont use extensively if your a passive user go stick if you ll everyday and even want to do gaming go box
brought this a a gift for my sister and she absolutely love it great product for the price
my son really like the larger screen to play game
after enabling thing you can ask it to do something love playing music
very happy with this basic ereader battery is great visibility is great even though it is not a paperwhite and form factor is mfortable special offer ad are totally non invasive and i hardly notice anything especially since i use the reader with wifi turned off sometimes i wish the power button wa on the top of the device rather than bottom where i feel i m more likely to accidentally press it but hardly a true problem
bought one for my wife and i i got the white one she got the black one started reading through stephen king is entire bibliography really loving it and really loving the device great battery life and functionality highly remmended if you are thinking about buying one just do it you wonregret it and make sure to set up your local library digital acunt to rent book for free
easy to use for a handicapped person i love it
i guess since i m saying that this is perfect for reading star seems cheeky it is just that since i m used used using a tablet which is definitely faster but at least i can read anywhere and there is no glare from the sun and it is not too bright which help with eyestrain
love it very nvenient simple to install no more cable
am used to kindle fire which i love no light to read by in the dark hard to navigate this wa a gift would never purchase on my own
so far i love alexa i have order stuff threw it i can ntrol my smart home from it set my alarm to wake me and water my lawn also doe voice call now
good tech product but need more basic information nstantly state that not able to answer my question at this time might need more information on how to program for more ntent information

i enjoy using the echo to tell me a joke stream some music or answer a question i find it useful for setting timer alarm or turning on off light
i got this a a christmas gift for my son and he ha really enjoyed it
this is a wonderful way to cut the cable rd we have amazon prime so our viewing membership is paid and there are so many tv show series movie to watch especially with kodi loaded on the unit we rounded it out with an inexpensive sling membership which give u the live tv we need for current news and network show we are saving so much on our cable bill and uld not be happier with our viewing experience
i enjoy my alexa i just have to talk to her and she also keep me connected with my family
unting back this is my th kindle since they came out i have never had to replace one that died but sometimes i want the newer feature this one is to replace the older book only unit that is starting to be un operative that i take to work for reading during lunch i d have probably just gotten another reading only unit like a paperwhite but these were le expensive plus can carry movie music etc like my kindle hd fire can easily let me shop on amazon can access free underground apps i really do not need it for game though and it is simple to use minus u power quickly like the kindle fire hd i have to charge it daily to every other day i set a password very highly remmended to prevent unauthorized u or purchase it ha given me minor problem with book by marking that i wa on a different page than where i stopped and it link to the other kindles and they go to that page a well for some reason accessory like case are more expensive if you want to store a good deal more you require an sd chip for gb
for dollar i would buy this tablet out of

i bought two of these for my parent while they were visiting these were an excellent choice a my parent are older being able to adjust the font size the backlit display touch screen all easy to use feature my parent read alot and have said many time now how much they enjoy them
i wa looking for a good cheap tablet for general use and this fit the bill the one thing that hit you outright is the build in marketing amazon u in the tablet that you cannot remove for instance the home screen is filled with link for amazon video amazon book amazon gift etc etc you anremove them but i found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them after that install a free app for a file manager then go in and rename the folder is that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide you will also need to install adobe reader to read pdf file since it is not installed another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it after a while though you get to ignore it performance is great fast and easy to navigate the built in browser ha everything you should need battery life look really good i had the screen brightness at about power and it looked good the screen black level is really good and the ntrast make the lors sparkle if you turn the brightness up too high the lors begin to wash out a little amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotion of amazon product once you get around that you see the value you get in this tablet
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
this is perfect for young child and me ready to use straight out of the box the case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold once you sign in with your parent acunt you can set up your child is profile and it is ready to go easy to navigate menu with great parental ntrols this tablet truly delivers safe ntent and game for hour of enjoyment the key is to load new ntent while you have access to wifi so the book game and video are available while traveling

i got this fire tv because my fire tv stick didnget good wifi reception in my bedroom it ha wired networking so it work great it is snappier than the fire tv stick and doe the same stuff
so i love love love e ink i m not even a big reader butis this magic technology that no one seems excited about there is literally ink inside the screen that move up or down electronically so it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance i like the kindle paperwhite and it doe everything i need but this particular version doe not have the same pleasing page lor a my year old kindle which is strange but i really needed the light to actually be able to read when i usually want to read so when the light is on it is pretty nice the interface is rather slow which is to be expected given it is not a traditional lcd screen it is literally a printing press but i wish the interface had better way to organize and change the order of book the other problem i had wa that the first one i received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen where the light diffuses through so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel also there were a few random stuck black spot the next one did not have these problem amazon will replace it for you if it doe
this is a great entry level tablet it ha full functionality and is well built the only thing i do not like is the slow processing speed but it is more than worth the money
bought this for my daughter for christmas she absolutely love it she ha been on it since she opened it
seems to just be a novelty which ha worn off

my grandbabie love their kindles this is the th kindle i buy for them
i love streaming tv with this device work very smoothly have had no glitch whatsoever
so far the only mplaint i have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product i had one for just about week when i noticed a definite issue staying connected my wife who ha had her kindle fire for month said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it i started removing them even to the point of restoring to factory setting several time after trying for about a week it simply would not stay connected to the internet it did stay connected to our wifi i contacted best buy but since it had been over week their policy is they cannot help unless you have purchased the extended warranty from them they said that is amazon is policy i contacted amazon and after a fairly brief support chat a new kindle wa on the way to it new home i have been pleased with it since it arrival it doe most of what i need email facebook minimal web use saving wear tear on my laptop
product work ok it is user friendly i do not really need or use it much after purchasing it for those that like it what a bargain
wa excited to get this product for it sheer portability alone doe not need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our echo dot but wa pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and volume we prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker and it hand free mode is a great updated feature though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it doe drain the battery faster
bought extra for a gift plan to give it for a christmas present
chicago is fabulous fountain is a big disappointment i read about it and expected beautiful picture instead there is a lot of print hamilton is the kind of book i like history chernow always writes very interesting biography i have read several others

my kid just love there tablet and they are very much worth the price
awesome only ga e four star because in order to allow a child to use it you have to set a password pin and ecah time that child go to use it they would need to enter it which would have been too much for the yr old that i bought it for a a christmas gift
for the price it is quite useful especially for having people over
this device can be a very load speaker i mean really loud it also can access amazon prime service without a mputer i like this little tap
would definitely remmend work well with iphone
love it easy to operate very reasonable price on sale
best tablet on the market for the price without a doubt
the two main purpose i use the echo for are the flash news briefing and a a bluetooth speaker alexa is not any more intuitive than siri or google assistant
it is pretty bright and the battery for this device last pretty long
very satisfied with my purchase would remmend it to friend and family
good for leisure reading for fun not for student
i bought this to replace a firestick i gave to a family member faster due to it ability to connect via ethernet to your router it also ha the ability to allow a hard drive to plug into it a fantastic device
this is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
i love the fact i cannotell it to play a song or turn the light on and not have to get up
this tablet is ok for a kid i wa expecting more because it is a fire brand

fast response voice mmands are ok but not always accurate highly remmend
great tablet great price perfect gift for your child my daughter love it
i thought it would be good for my year old he doe awesome on a ipad but uld not get the hang of the kindle fire

from what i cannotell my kid love these i do wish there wa an option to keep it on the kid profile though
amazing what echo can do look forward do more with the update that me out
i bought these for my niece for christmas because their older version kindle fire did not have a storage slot and they were mplaining that they had to delete thing off of them in order to use them i keep getting huge thank yous from them every time i see them they are so thrilled to have them and be able to use them without deleting anything
great for kid just learning to use a tablet for the first time
i wa attracted by the price of the base kindle but in the end opted for the paperwhite a it wa illuminated and had rounded edge which felt more mfortable definitely worth the extra few dollar in my opinion my local library offer free loan of ebooks which i have been taking advantage of there are also many free book online sample and classic with expired pyrights battery life is good and the device is lightweight even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare i prefer this to a physical book which i never expected
an amazon fire tablet for need i say more worth every penny
this is great product the tablet are made tough and great price
this device is very easy to set up a long a you know your wifi password amazon acunt information and a tv with an available hdmi port fyi you must have an amazon acunt to use this device
great tablet for the price i enjoy the ability to seperate my log in acunt from my kid is acunt
i use it every single day in the kitchen for oking timer to listen to music and to ntrol light in our house it ha definitely made our busy life nvenient highly remmend it if you are thinking of automating your house
my daughter love it except that she cannot connect to her chromecast
i found this tablet to be very easy to use and really liked the dual camera it ha
when i first got echo for my wife and i we really didnhave the highest expectation it wa really something we got to entertain guest now that we have had it for a few month we have found so many u for it turn on light when we me home ensures door are locked before bed ntrols the temp in the home play music we love it
like the screen easier to read happy that we bought it
love the kindle paperwhite it is so light weight but best of all i can read outside the light also allows reading at night and doe not bother my spouse only problem i do not like the case i purchased online and no vers at best buy or target
this is so much better than the kindle that i purchased year ago it is much faster and i really like how long the battery last before needing to be charged
the amazon fire hd tablet is a high quality inexpensive piece of technology that work great for anyone looking to purchase one that wonbreak the bank
i wa surprised buy how light and mpact this wa but still strong enough to do what i needed
this tablet uld be so much better if the apps actually worked decently the built in amazon piece for prime member is great and work flawlessly but it is not enough to overme the terrible app behavior and untless freeze they need to take a lesson or two from apple
the fire tv ha been a great addition to my home theater it ha a polished interface and quality feeling remote i especially appreciate the fact that there is an ethernet port included on the fire tv overall i have been very satisfied with the fire tv
i love this device it ha a host of information but you must ask the question in the rrect order the music library is really good the joke can be a little rny like all joke the alarm feature is good and the look and styling is outstanding
i brought tablet for my yr old son it wa okay for him but i wa not crazy about the amazon apps it wa a decent tablet though for that price
grandbaby wonput it down love itshe is dropped it too many time the blue ver ha protected her tablet every time
tab is good and fit for my req and battery life is also gpod
for reading game facebook twitter minor surfing the internet this is a great device it is small but not so small a to be difficult to read fairly quick and dependable for the price it is hard to beat
i purchased this tablet for my daughter and she absolutely love it it ha parental ntrols also which she doe not love
bought this e reader a a gift for my wife and she love it
got this one for only added a gb micro sd and a nice ver it is not an ipad it is not nexus it doe not run android well kinda but i got a high quality and well equipped tablet for le than a hundred dollar
priced for the modest budget but is totally capable of performance to satisfy the basic need of entry level tablet user
great device to entertain the child while traveling
i have been watching the review online and checking with friend that have purchased the echo to see how much they liked or disliked it feature last person i talked to went on and on about all the thing there were using it for and that persuaded me it wa time and amazon prime day wa the perfect opportunity to go for it amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info taining mmand center there are so many ol and awesome thing it able to do that i ll hit the highlight that work for our household first we love that it follows your voice in the room the circle lighting will show which direction it is listening the speaker is wonderfully balanced so whether listening to music the news or to alexa speaking i have nothing but high mark for it sound quality given it size next set up after downloading the app to our iphones wa quick easy and very intuitive the more you look over the app the more you will realize a world of skill that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them we have added thing to shopping list while asking about the weather and our calendar of event and then asked alexa to change the temp of our nest thermostat in various part of the house simply by saying her name and then our mmands sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pa through she is always there listening and ready we have ordered some led programmable light and i can hardly wait for alexa to help set the mood in the house room to room all from a simple voice request even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone tablet and watch that can ntrol device it huge to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion i am a regular amazon prime shopper and reviewer if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the echo please mark the helpful button it tell amazon that folk are in fact reading review like this thanks
we love this so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this

it is not a very powerful tablet i needed something just to view netflix and some other video not to mention play some music and look at photo other than that i think it is too weak not good for gaming for the price though you cannot beat it
good tablet for the price good for reading book and most apps
overpriced and should be free with kindle purchase
i bought this table for my year old nephew and he love it a bit small but for him it good
the echo is so much fun and versatile it ntinues to grow with more apps that are nstantly being developed
work perfectly for a a small tablet for checking facebook and playting game the screen is so much larger than the phone for easier viewing it is nice that it cannotake picture but the quality is not up to most phone
i tryed the gb to see if it wa any different from the gb and found little difference may hold more apps
it is a great tablet both of my kid have one would buy another one
love the firetv box it is faster than the firestick had more storage space n allows for ethernet cable connection for more stable connection if u get a tv with roku built in there can be interference between box n tv dont get roku built in tv with this box
picked up one of thear love it easy to set up and install great price

the battery life is great last on a bus trip to kept he quiet
quite an upgrade from the original fire the deletion of the carousel wa a welme change the new turn style approach is faster and more nsice still do not know why a chime sound also miss the ease of making note while reading there ha got to be a better way to organize book trying to figure out series trilogy etc is impossible and if you buy a series in a set then the chance are good that amazon wonpick up a new purchase a a book already read
best divine for streaming movie and tv show the wifi and processor are fast
we needed something easy to use for our bedroom tv watching it wa easy to set up and with our wired connection it function very quickly and is easy to navigate with the simple remote
i wa looking for a reader that wa just a reader i did not want a tablet the paperwhite is the perfect choice for me it is very easy to use and ha a clear reading surface it is a great size and i can read outside inside and in the dark i read the review and then went to best buy to see it it wa everything the review said some said there is a gray area at the bottom of the screen but i did not find that i highly remmend it

the protector wa not made for the fire a it wa to large and had no direction that were herent worse purchase from best buy ever
it may not be a speed demon but this tablet run very well and the fire o is easy to navigate and use i m taking off one star due to some annoying limitation like the fact that the o make you use it own browser at all time but overall it is a smart buy if you want to test a tablet out

the biggest drawback to this product is the lack of any instruction user manual included with the package you are forced to experiment with the ntrols to boot it up and start using it if you are adventurous and pc oriented it is no problem if you are not good luck

this is what it ha me to you can now buy a quality tablet for amazing work well just uple thing it u amazon app store not google play store it run an o called fire which is based on android o so you may not find apps that are available the same a android of urse all of the big name apps are there but if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hand for not a lot of money this is a great choice amazon ha a philosophy they want to make money after the sale so that is why they get you in at a low price also they have created a revenue stream by selling ad when your screen time out it will post a screen saver wallpaper that is an advertisement if you want you can go to your amazon acunt pay a one time fee per unit not per acunt to get rid of them
bought this for my year old dad it wa to mplicated for him to use i uld not figure enough of it out to be able to explain it all to him in the time i wa visiting him returned and bought a different kind

i bought the echo and a few hue light bulb when the radio that i use to listen to npr new in the morning died on me i have been very happy i didneven have to set it up to find my radio station i just said alexa listen to fm and she did it just like that my kid ask her to check their math problem for their homework we use her to check the weather before getting dressed in the morning the lighting set up wa super easy alexa is a nice addition to our family
a must have if you are a prime member i love alexa plus the kid love it too they keep asking question to alexa
my kid love the product really durable after drop
the echo ha the best integration in to amazon for shopping purpose it also some excellent integration with other smart device such ha logitech harmony and smart thing however it is not quite a intuitive a the google home device or able to answer a many question so overall good for home automation not so much for asking general question
i have one and like it so much that i purchased one for my son it can be used for entertainment or to ntrol a smart home
allows my teen to access apps and internet while still reading on down time between game
gave a gift the recipient powered down his ipad and is giving it away

my godson love it he is only and think this is the best thing ever
i wa looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that i uld use it to read musical chart off of when i perform and this little tablet ha been a great solution for me the screen is sharp and bright the wifi pick up fairly weak signal and make good use of what is available the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate it seems built fairly well and for i m happy
perfect for checking email small but not too small to watch my favorite show movie would highly remmend
for the price hand down best tablet out there excellent for reading in bed without disturbing your partner thanks to the blue shade mode
i had the firestick but decided to get the box based on review and am happy i did because the box is much faster and better overall
amazon fire tv work very well with the sony play vue i purchased a send unit for another tv the response time is quick and the alexa voice search so quick and good it beyond good i do not use the wifi function although i have a wifi in the house instead i have a ethernet cable plugged in for both unit i would most certainly buy this unit again worth every penny i spent on it
best tablet i have ever owned super clear picture amazing sound the battery last forever brightness is adjustable so it is great for reading or game playing around on the internet
this ha to be one of the best technology purchase i have made honestly i wa simply looking for a good quality bluetooth speaker when i found the echo it wa around the same price range a the speaker i already had under nsideration but echo doe so much more i purchased the lifx light for my home wifi connectivity and ntrol them via echo alexa turn on the bathroom light or alexa change hall light to blue i love it the sound quality for music is fantastic and the amazon music library is packed full of all of my favorite song i also use echo to check the location of my package get news and weather update every morning while i get ready for work and keep an easy to use shopping list seriously love this thing
moving to this from the first generation paperwhite appears to have been the right move i love the new size it just feel tiny and perfect in the hand the new automatic brightness setting work quite well i do wish i uld crank up the force required to activate the page turn button however a i have frequently hit them accidentally the page turn button do work with glove on which a great for reading in a tree stand
we re finding it hard to navigate this thing others mostly the young one think it is easy
the backlighting is great and it is much easier to read and turn the page from the original kindle highly remmended
work whenever i want learns my speech pattern and i can use it listen to music whenever i want
ok for a entry level tablet great screen for watching movie good hd image
didnwant to spend on the echo for someone who is not use to using a bluetooth speaker great buy and function well
the type resolution is fantastic and the screen brightness auto adjust mpensates perfectly for both dark room and full sunshine on the beach

i love it because it is functional and mplete for i needed
my mom had been wanting one for a while so this wa great
tablet is a bit smaller than i imagined for an tablet and thin and flimsy i do not like super thin tablet the lor is a bit washed out and there is no way to make the lors darker or richer frustrating that you cannot use google play store and the sound is not very loud either it is ok i expected it to be better but for simple u it is fine photo are also grainy and faded it doe rerd in rather low lighting which help me personally and the battery charge hold a long time the tangerine lor is also very nice and it is fairly simple to use overall i would have expected a better product but again for simple use it is ok will upgrade to a better product eventually i wa spoiled by my lor nook
i love electronics and thought the kindle would be nice but certainly not something i needed it is a reading game changer it is so easy to take with me hold a charge for such a long time but the best part of all is how mfortable it make reading my eye are never strained i can read in bright sunshine or a deep dark cave being an audible customer i can switch back and forth from listening to reading and the paperwhite always keep my place it is just amazing
it is a great product the sound quality is amazing would remmend this to all my friend

i bought three of these for my kid age to and it work great for what they use them for my only wish is that it came with google play store but we were able to install that separately and work well

small table for a small price mparable to other tablet option on the market but not a user friendly a i d hoped i prefer samsung and the google playstore initial set up took a while citing the table to uld not locate wifi but it wa on an accessible and in use by other device at the same moment with accessibility for the fire tablet to also connect eventually it connected but the ability to use the tablet function tool etc with ease wa disappointing to myself adult and child i purchased it for however it is a great first time tablet and priced well
gave this to my wife for christmas to replace her well used first generation kindle she love it

the kindle fire is are a great product to own we own and our whole family enjoys them easy to use
this product is pretty spectacular when you have thing to pair with it i personally have hue light in several room in my house and the echo pair seamlessly with the hue device making ntrolling the light via voice simple the only touchy part with that is terminology you say to get the light to turn on and off i have only had my echo for week so i am not an advanced echo user by any mean however this product seems to have endless capability and only developing more daily my only problem came when trying to keep my echo paired with my dish box so i can ntrol my tv with my voice this feature seems to lose connectivity easily and ha proven to be slightly difficult to re pair after the initial pairing of the two device other then that the echo ha been a great addition to my home and very user friendly
i had a kindle for several year that i thought wa adequate until i purchased the paper white what a difference with all of the added feature this kindle offer i like the light with it is brightness feature most of all the ease of use make it a great e reader for everyone i highly remmend the new paperwhite

i think the tablet is great it is plenty apps and book for child to read and interact with i also like the option that they do not just have book that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good all around device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it
is easy to use great to look up word you donâknow a you go along itâ is also great that the light isnâshone up into your eye it make it so that they donâget easily tired and they donâhurt
pro hd quality for low price work really well with my amazon acunt to access multiple amazon feature with extreme ease uld not be happier i have ipads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet love it
good value for the price and for the child the apps are enough to let them play and read
bought this a a gift at holiday she love the size and ease of use good reception performance
i love the inch kindle fire great graphic and easy to handle and read from
had a great experience with my best buy rep great job
i have mpared the kindle fire to the samsung galaxy tab a the kindle ha a longer lasting battery and it ha a fire o it offer a wide range of amazon feature such a free e book movie and game that are only offered with the kindle fire
great starter tablet got these for my grandson they love them
the resolution is obviously more subtle than my old kindle but the back light is not very even especially on the bottom it is a mmon issue for the new generation
my husband gave me one for christmas and i love it my entire family u it my son is visually impaired so he ha access to so much with alex
i enjoy this reader due to it large storage capacity for my growing library and the ability to navigate to a given location in no time flat the bright but adjustable lighting is very welme a well
poor choice the product did not work after only one week it froze on me and i wa unable to get it to go to the factory reset i would not remmend this product at this time i will call amazon back to ask for my money and a refund after going on line i see that this is a mmon problem a problem that they should solve
i like the speed of the fire tv i use to have a fire tv stick then upgraded to the fire tv i m very satisfied
firebox is awesome would remmend to everyone great option
i liked this tablet because it is easy to use and i like amazon product but if you are looking for something simple that doe not break the bank and get the job done this product is for you
bought a a gift she love it great with amazon prime
would remmend this tablet to friend and family this is my third kindle product
the amazon fire hd is awesome easy to navigate lor is beautiful
i absolutely love my amazon echo i purchased the echo dot for a send room i love to play old school music and it ha found some really fantastic music very helpful in answering most question i have so much more i am planning to do once i learn more
pretty good tablet i use it for my year old daughter she really like it very practical small travel size device for when we are traveling back forth on the road very sturdy keep charge long time a reliable piece of technology for my family for my tech need
great sound and voice response easy to set up and use
we have book and learning apps on it he love it i think that it is all around good tablet for kid or adult
bought this for my wife who swore she would never give up paperback book now she u this one all the time it is the perfect size to fit in her purse for trip too
my daughter ha been enjoying it since her birthday
i love the fire stick but sometimes not crazy about using wifi the fire tv can be hard wired which limit some buffering issue not that it is ever really been an issue it is still really easy to use and setup just like the fire stick
fast and easy to use kid friendly simple to navigate clear and clean picture
great multimedia solution i do not have a smart tv and this is a perfect solution all apps i will ever need are available easy to install and get started and yet very easy to use great product
smaller than i thought and processing speed is not very good with that said for the price you cannot beat it
like the size and ease of use hold charge easy to download book easy to read
this is my first kindle and i have been very pleased with it for what i payed for it
it is okay doe what it is suppose to amazon is kind of annoying but otherwise good buy
i love my kindle i prefer this to the fire because i only want it for book not application and i can read this screen in the sunlight the battery life is good and even better if i turn the wifi off i m very happy with my purchase
it a nice tablet however it uld be better but you get what you pay for
this amazon fire tv box is perfect for kodi and is really fast
it wa awesome kid love it this is simply amazing
i bought this product based on review and it fit the description a a near perfect reasonably priced all purpose kindle reader the screen is front lit display allows me to read under all lighting nditions from bright sunlight to dark without eyestrain i bought the paperwhite a a supplemental reader for my samsung tablet so that i uld read outside after several month of use i m finding that i do all my reading on the paperwhite i read several hour a day and the battery last four or five day under that usage which is a great change from my tablet which needed a recharge daily usually at an innvenient time i remmend buying the mpanion leather case because the case put the paperwhite to sleep with the ver is closed extending battery life
love alexa so much fun to ask question and get information
this box ha it all doe k and also ha a super fast quad re processor ha great wifi ac and also ha the ethernet plug in great streaming machine but the best thing about it is the price
i have had ipad mini is before so this tablet in my opinion cannot mpare however that being said i bought this tablet for the purpose to watch netflix and read book on in my opinion it handle these two task perfectly the screen is not a clear and crisp like other tablet but hey i didnpay for it either i like this size and it seems fast i d have to say i like it a lot on another note i m giving this review only star because i am absolutely annoyed at best buy and their shipping this is about the rd time i have ordered a product and had it shipped to me and best buy said it would be here at a certain date and ups screw it up every time do not have any issue anywhere else but always when i order from best buy and have it mailed to me anyways the tablet is good for the price and i d remmend it over any other lower end teblets
i love this i have bout three of these for my grand child and one of the wind up getting a different tablet and i wa able to keep it for myself instead of returning and i just love it it wa nfusing figuring out how to download on it but one of my grandchild figured it out for me
i like the fire tv much better than the fire stick
reading in bright sunlight is now easy on the eye
i have had the old hd amazon tablet which i use with the student at the school where i teach got this tablet on my first day at this job to keep at home and use the larger real estate of this tablet is fantastic along with the new version of the o
bought this for my mother for christmas i wanted something small enough for her to handle and reliable decided a fire tablet fit the bill and best buy had plenty in stock
it is a good piece of technology it is just not connecting to the wifi
we love this fire tv just hard to find show for now
never knew i needed a tablet until i got my hand on this one
i m in love with alexa this is the most amazing piece of technology i have ever owned
i got this for myself the price on this is amazing for what you get yes i would of liked to get an ipad because i m very used to apple an i have a iphone but the price difference between these it pretty much a no brainier for me
took sometime to learn all the thing it can do very easy to set up
great
they had the tablet in stock and it is nice that it ha the child setting
overall it is okay i do not like that it take forever to charge
this is perfect for my year old i love the option for acunts the kid acunt is very streamline
my child loved it and it is great learning tool
got it during black friday weekend at a great price work good no problem with them
easy to use long rd
excellent product easy to use mostly used for reading and utilizing aps
hat off to amazon the echo i started with not have dot too in the home music alarm to do list shopping list and just home automation is awesome i m in the nd century now
bought this for my father a he had my old kindle easy for him to use
great tablet phenomenal value for the money i have bought one for everyone in my family
since i do not like to read the news i just ask echo for my news update and getting the weather for any day for any city and state is a snap
i love my firestick but the addition of k streaming is worth getting the firetv it seems to be noticeably faster a well
my year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet he did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the feature that this wa the tablet for him he can connect to our home wi fi to access the internet you tube and game we monitor what he is accessing for safety purpose this is much smaller than an ipad but is very mobile and easy for kid to use i bought a case for it to protect it from drop and allows my son to work from multiple angle on the tablet
this tablet is for my daughter and she absolutely love it
i use it for game and movie it great good picture quality great sound uld use more storage space but i guess thats why they make sd card
need more apps and ha bug that need fixing
i only bought this because i wanted to give my friend one and she wa not getting the new one lol i had heard there wa not much difference between them so didnplan to buy one before they were wrong it is so much faster going into the store browsing turning page and opening book i used to get aggravated at the lag time and rarely bought book on it used my phone to buy because it wa so annoyingly slow to respond speed wa the first thing i noticed the screen look a bit clearer though i wa happy with the old one is screen too it is worth the upgrade
my yr old love it he stay on the pad for hour and never get bored
it worth every penny the kid loved it our home is quieter then ever
good for the price ended up returning it for the model up that had some extra feature
this is a great tablet this wa the best one i got
well a good table for under it is not bad i ended getting the toshiba k tv with built in chromecast so i need an inexpensive table so i would not use my phone turn out that the tablet doe have play store so i wa unable to download google home this tablet would be great for kid for a started tablet you can also ntrol how much time kid can spend on it unfortunately it wa not for since it didnwork for what i need
i would highly renmnd this product to anybody i use it on a daily basis
it is small enough for my daughter to carry around she loved it
the best streaming box on the market hand down just buy it thank me later
small yet powerful hdmi connection k capable amazon ntent plus android framework nearly perfect
i had a kindle a uple of year ago and didnlike it but with the great price and wanting to get another tablet i bought this one and am very glad i had some trouble setting it up due to password issue but now it is easy and offer lot to do and for sure more for me to learn i highly remmend this product maybe for someone starting out it doe a much a an ipad in an easy to carry package great photo email everything and the price cannot be beat
love it even though i do not have a lot of other smart product that alexa is mpatible with
i will remmend for other parent to buy this product
love the lor easily to navigate and add apps need a memory card though
if you dont need the voice activation of alexa or want a smaller footprint and something that you cannotake with you nsider the tap almost all of the functionality of alexa but in a smaller and le expensive version great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternative
this product doe exactly what i expected it to do loved it so much i bought two
it very nvenient it small and it work awesome can put in my purse or
this is a pretty good little tablet for a beginner i bought this for my year old son and he love it
i love my echo my son had one since it first came out and frankly i wa not that impressed and didnthink i would use it i love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them i decided to try it and thought if i didnlike it i uld take it back well wa i surprised ahead of buying it i had already set up more of my amazon prime music playlist and the library too then i also went to pandora and created more playlist and station there that saved a lot of time set up wa so simple no problem at all i find i use the news briefing every morning what is on my calendar for the day or a specific day and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod i usually do not unless we have mpany also adding to shopping list and to my google calendar i use all the time i would say the negative are if you have the volume up higher she doe not always hear you for the mmand another learning curve is the mmands themselves it is hard to remember exactly how she want you to say the task right now i am writing down on index card the skill i cannot seem to remember such a mindfullness from prime which play quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between amazon prime and pandora if you do not say the exact playlist name that you made she cannot find it easily overall just love it i looked into buying the echo dot to place that in my bedroom but wa so disappointed that they have sold out and disntinued it there is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar but i liked the fact that it wa a plug in not internal battery that only last a few year i wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the tap ha a charger unit with it more bulky not excellent review but the dot had great review
great tablet at a very good price it work for everyone in the house from downloading apps game to reading
kid love it and well integrated with harmony remote
it wa doing a great job charging my kindle but now it take almost all day to charge
the paperwhite kindle is the best option for someone who is just looking for a kindle to read on and download book would not have chosen a different one at all
the kindle paperwhite is an awesome alternative to a paperback book great reading and lighting in all angle and lighting nditions price is great mpared to similar device great at what it designed for i highly remmend if you want a dedicated reading tablet
this is my send fire tv box and it is a great upgrade from the first gen model i had the buffer time is lightning quick faster than my roku the k work well and the amazon esystem is actually more mplete than what the apple tv offer very happy with this purchase
it is not a easy to use but battery life is great it is just taking time for me to get used to it
we al love them it is great for netflix and everything else
you really cannot go wrong here it exactly what you want out of an e reader and nothing more
bought this gift for my wife and she love it work a expected
it is great for kid at this price not it not an ipad can only buy from kindle so apps are somewhat limited this edition added a sd slot to add storage
i m very happy with it the sound is far superior than the echo dot really like the fact you can use it a an interm if you have multiple echo home
i purchased this for my daughter and she love it i love the user friendly parental ntrols
i love my reader i love that i can read outdoors and i can choose the size and the font of the text i love the new battery life it is for real i can go day without a charge in fact i have never run out of power and had it off the power for day the only thing i wish is that it were just a little bit larger but i love everything else about it i highly remmend it to anyone who want a good reader
easy to use simple interface and the right size for quick and easy web surfing and movie watching
my kid loved this tablet and use it almost every day battery life is pretty good for how much they use it
the tablet is great for young child they really enjoy it can be slow at time and they get frustrated when that happens
no the best tabler is loaded with bloatware from amazon
great for kid and adult easy to use and carry around
easy to use kid friendly plenty to watch great price
this is awesome this item wa a gift for my elderly father in law who is not too tech savvy didnwant to spend the big buck with an ipad so this wa a great alternative
i think this is a great product solution especially for the price i needed to replace my portable dvd player i have young kid and still wanted something to play movie on the plane and during car trip after looking at my option i decided on getting them both a kindle for about the same price of dvd player head up the disney anywhere app take some work to download the movie on the kindle but there is a way you have to access it through amazon movie in order to download them i got a microsd card to store the movie on and so far so good they held up supplied game movie and when there is wi fi they can play abcmouse to get some learning in there too great buy good luck getting those movie downloaded

very easy to use mfortable and easy to see screen lot of book to choose from
the more i use this the more reason i enjoy it the staff were great and helped me set it up
received this tablet a present for young grandson while i am not an amazon tablet fan do not like hybrid operating system this device meet all the requirement i had hoped for ease of use optional micro sd capacity and plenty of internal memory
portability perfectbattery greatease of use excellent
we have enjoyed the unit and have used it a lot since we purchased it
this device ha changed our home automation system to make it usable it integrates with so much and doe about anything you cannothink of i am excited to just see how far they take it
i think that this tablet is only good for reading book it is not very fast so you wonbe able to do anything else
this tablet doe what it supposed to do however if you have one of the newer smart phone with a large screen there just is not enough difference in the screen size to justify a send piece of equipment
my nd would way rather have a fire any day than an ipad
easy setup nice o no issue whatsoever voice regnition in the remote is sweet and work well
the kindle paperwhite is absolutely a perfection it is perfect for just picking up a book and instantly starting where you left off the lighting is so realistic it feel like you re just reading real paper definitely a bargain
absolutely love this tablet this is the send one we have purchased for our year old our year old ha one a well
i purchased the kindle out of sadness at first to nform to the non book life but can honestly say i m glad i did my book reading ha gone up easily and this mpact guy ha made all the difference easy to use easy to store light to hold doe not bother my eye just magnificent i would suggest this to anyone i found the back light better on the eye than the paperwhite and the battery is great
love that i do not have to clutter my living room with dvd
the firestick is great and sasy to use i tell all my friend how great it is i have purchase one gor my travel
i had been eyeing the amazon echo for a while now best buy had a sale for off normally it wa so i jumped on it i absolutely love my amazon echo it wa everything i imagined it would be and more if i had to do it all over again i would have paid the

got this to replace the samsung tab a that samsung tab lagged a lot but i have not seemed to have a much problem on the fire tab the only downside is that the battery dy fast
great tablet from amazon i work quickly and smoothly
i had to return my device due to wifi signal dropping maybe i just had a bad unit
i dumped cable after using streaming and playstation vue i have one fire tv in my bedroom and loved it so i bought a fire stick for downstairs the fire stick wa slow by mparison so i upgraded and have no issue with the fire tv the fire tv is worth the extra money the variety of service offered and the speed pay off if you have a good connection i do not have k but i can only assume it will be a quality stream when i do
gave a a christmas gift she love it did have to pay to ship it though
this is the first tab my niece is using and she is just loving it
so this is my send fire tv and just like my first one i love this one just a much my advice is you are debating between the fire stick or the fire tv pay the extra money and get the fire tv
tablet wa reasonably priced would say it is a starter tablet for kid kind of slow on response but the kid enjoy it
the kindle paperwhite is the perfect e reader the screen resolution size and capacity make a mplete package if your objective is to read this is the optimal product if you want to play game or are enamored with lor for magazine viewing do not purchase this product
alexa is always there when i need her play music tell joke know how to multiply add subtract keep a shopping list and a myriad of other thing really fun
love my echo great for the kitchen have used it often purchased one for my son and he love his too
life battery very good search engine very good very fast

i used a kindle many year ago but didnlike the size or the weight or the lack of backlight this solves all those problem i find the screen is a little small for my vision when i increase the font sizei need to turn the kindle page more time than a book page but that is me otherwise it doe well turn the page smoothly and is easy to use
love this unit help me stay ahead of the game everyone should own one
fast lot of ntent right step towards cutting the rd
the device ha several interesting application for reading a well a mpleting necessary task for enhanced medium
they love it and when they are here that is all they want to do but i do limit their time on it
great product for the you cannot go wrong with purchase
the amazon echo is an essential piece of technology to achieve the mplete smarthome experience two thumb up

we bought these kindles for a gift for the kid on black friday the price wa amazing and they are durable i know we will get our money out of them i love that there is parental ntrol you can password protect area where you do not want the kid to disver yet overall great value for the price
this thing is great very quick streaming and no issue so far love the voice ntroller on finding show or movie
is nice for reading sometimes the screen is a little slow hate the ad on the main screen
i love the option that you have with the fire box over other like product
it wa okay but most of my apps were stripped down version on the hd fire it wa inexpeisve but you get what you pay for the o is is pretyy premitive the hardware doe fell nice i would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person
great product good speed nice resolution for the price
i purchased this to use playstation vue and it seems to be working well i also use if for youtube and netflix quite a few review mmented on the remote losing connection with the main unit but i have not had that problem
the tablet wa cheap and a great deal the kid love it it is very nice because it ha a kid mode and a separate parent mode

i got this tablet for a senior that is learning to to use a tablet and learning navigate through apps and the internet and adjust to a reader
i have several amazon kindles already this wa a nice reasonable st tablet for my little one i have been quite happy with the kindle device
the amazon echo is a fun item to have around the house it is amazing what you can ask it the possibility are endless
work great
this speaker is great for the price i love how the speaker is degree so you get the same sound in any part of the room
we decided to buy the amazon tab due to the great price on black friday we returned them
this is an awesome tablet it is fast with great picture
we got these for my kid for christmas and they absolutely love them all i did wa set up a free time acunt for them to play and watch video best part is that is all they can do so i do not have to worry about them going anywhere off limit
this tablet is a nice gift for my granddaughter they spending a lot of time reading book on this and they have a fun time with the game love it
i bought my fire tv last month and i like it sofar i can use alexa on remote ntrol not even to search in tv program i can ask every question for some reason youtube app is not installed by default and there is no web browsing app installed by default the default untry address is turkey and if you do not change it you can not install some apps because of restriction installing apps is tricky for some apps i think it d be nice to have more flexibility on software aspect of this device other than that i like everything about it
returning for a replacement it got wet and quite working for a child is device it should be better made
they love it work like it should without too many issue
this is a great tablet at a great price it wa easy to set up
got this to use with my smartthings home automation system use voice mmands from the echo to trigger automation much more nvenient than getting your phone out and loading the smartthings app sometimes it ha a hard time understanding what i say
i had the first generation firetv and it wa great i wanted something that wa a little faster for playing game and also for using with plex plex work so much better on this generation than the first more of the video that i have can be played direct instead of being transded game also seem much smoother on this device than the first generation but it is hard to tell due to the limited type of game on the amazon app store if you are looking for a device that can stream netflix hulu hbo go amazon prime video and espn and still be used for casual gaming then this is the device for you
cannot beat the fire tb at wa able to root it in about min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab i mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great only mplaint is the processor is little lacking mpared to phone with the same spec
great tablet drop it many time and it still working
love the tap the speaker is nice likenit ha a charging cradle it can sit on easy charge
me in handy at work allows for quick online pizza order ha great game available and help me pa time reading a book when visiting the doctor
this is a great tablet for the money i got it on black friday and am so glad i did get a few of them for the entire family the biggest thing that sold me on this is that i am able to use parental ntrols and not worry about what my little kid are watching reading or playing go buy it for the family you wonregret it
alexa and i are best friend she play music tell joke reminds of my shopping list and on and on she is great
this newer kindle reader is great it is lightweight easy to hold and the battery last long i will definitely remmend it to friend the white lor is especially classy looking
i would remmend this to all of our friend and family it is worth every penny good warranty me with a free subscription work quickly and is very durable
pretty good tablet keep the kid interested which is why i brought it
my first reader wa a sony and i loved it but it wa getting old and quit working well so i did research and everyone seemed to like the kindle paperwhite and so that is what i bought i like it i do not love it like i did my sony because it battery need to be charged every two week the battery in my sony lasted much longer than that between charge but other than that it work great and is easy to read in any light sunlight or indoor lighting
wire tv work perfect if you want all of your steaming in one place
nice addtion too my television it is so easy to use
i purchased this for my daughter for christmas i own one a well and i love it
i bought this a a gift for my boyfriend who wa looking for a simple e reader he loved it it is simple without the fancy feature of a tablet but it work for what he wanted to simply read book the no glare screen and optional back light are both great feature
the only mplaint is that you get a year free of amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel
this device work well and however there is no clear way to tell what programming is free with subscription or what requires a fee
easy to set up the parental ntrols and safety feature make this a great purchase
bought this for my dad food christmas and he love it
it is fun for the family to use echo alexa ha been of help to answer question that the kid ask many time related to their homework also work great with rd party product like nest is will keep getting better and better over time a more ntent data and integration bemes available for alexa
the kindle paperwhite is a great device it is easy to use and the size is very nvenient when i take it on a trip it is like having a whole library with me mpared with the kindle app on my cell phone i find the kindlepaper white a lot easier to use and the size is better it is easier to read and it feel like a book
i have cancelled my cable best purchase i have made in a long time the picture quality is amazing
i really like the amazon echo it give me information w o my having to log online alexa is voice is clear and the information ncise i like the sleek look the blue ring that allows you to know when you have connected with alexa there have been quite a few question she cannot answer hopefully a we beme used to the echo and how to phrase question our luck will improve
it is ha the perfect setting for my kid usage keep her away from all the inappropriate stuff n she ha easy access to any downloads that interest her only downside is she cannot access youtube kid
the tablet is very functional and it is offered at a great price it had everything i wa looking for in a tablet i am very pleased with my purchase
i love the amazon echo it a great device for finding answer to question or listening to music on side note it is a great learning tool for a grade school student love playing question getting the local weather report and keeping shopping list
fun to have and the kid can get all kind of info from alexa
good for the price low memory but good descent graphic easy to use
i bought tablet and my family wa not disappointed
we are enjoying alexa for her flash briefing of the news music on demand calendar review and shopping list we have not even begun to touch on what alexa can do cannot wait to learn more
amazon fire is perfect for family on the go it fit well into backpack purse and briefcase
best buy had this product when no one else did ok
this one i got for a relative who enjoyed ours we love listening to music asking it question and getting the weather i know there are more feature but these alone make it a winner
cheap and work great awesome beginner tablet amazon did a great job affordable and great for something just to have and play with

perfect for a graduation gift when you are unsure of what the person find interesting
this really is not a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck i bought this for about just to kill time on a uple of long flight so i didnwear out the battery on my phone i definitely would not remmend using this for reading a the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at i only used it to read some mics and play game on a screen bigger than a phone so i got what i wanted out of it
paid buck for it and with that you cannot mplain great for a general use tablet
good for light user i bought tax it is worth than price

i have used kindle e reader since amazon introduced them year ago all are good product and each new model ha been a worthwhile upgrade the oasis is no exception even from the highly touted voyage model it is expensive but the lightweight design improved backlighting and battery ver are worth the additional expense for someone who read frequently this is definitely a good investment

very nice matte screen that is easy on the eye if you want a ebook reader this is the best one
product worked a described no issue with performance and it wa a simple setup perfect for web browsing and video
what great interactive feature understands mmands very well except when music is loud why not add a digital or analog output so it can be used in njunction with your home audio a well
product seems to connect to wi fi pretty easily so far ha been pretty durable and held up to a uple of drop good picture and it stream game pretty easily
it is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e reader the voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trip i feel the premium for the page turn sensor is little too high in hindsight i would go with the paper white and save a few buck
great tablet starter for kid and also like that it me in different lors

i wa looking for something easier to read email with than my phone but small and light for travel this is just the right size i have an inch tablet but it is too large and heavy
this product is very amazing it fast to answer and it doe so much more love it
i originally bought this solely for the boingo app however it ha a large selection of apps and i now use it everyday

i bought this for my daughter it is our th kindle bought within the family the touchscreen is great and my daughter love it in fact those of u with older model kindles are jealous
i would highly remmend this kindle it is user friendly and not to big but large enough to see easily

my niece love it of urse her older and wild sibling like taking it from her but overall she say she love it
great device and ha great sound the voice activation is very tight and once you realize how alexa answer she is very helpful
this ver is made for the kindle dx and fit it beautifully the problem and it is a big one is if you accidentlly try to open the ver from the back which is very easy to do you can damage the kindle without even realizing what is happened my husband did this and cracked the kindle frame within the first week of owning the device fortunately only the frame wa cracked and the kindle still work we cannot however remove the ver because of the way it hook into the device the hook closure must be bent because of the accidental attempt to open the back ver after the incident we attempted to clip the back ver to the kindle but found this to be cumbersome and the clip would not stay in place we are just extremely careful now but the damage wa done almost immediately i hope this design flaw ha been fixed
bought this for my year old granddaughter she loved it easy to use and excellent display i am nsidering one for myself now that i have seen and used hers very light also
great for everyday use price is right easy to setup use
i bought two of these this year and i love my fire tv it is very fast and fairly cheap the customer service wa great when i bought my fire tv i can watch my amazon prime hulu netflix everything from one box i will be purchasing one more cuz i love them so much specially when you stream using an ethernet cable which the best this box is really fast it doe not buffer
i do not care for having to close each window separately i would prefer to be able to select close all or exit all
this amazon fire is fine for just reading and minimal research and investigative work apart from e reading it is slow and unresponsive
would enurage others to purchase if they are avid reader can go anywhere
fun disvering u for the echo i can already see that the more i use it the more useful it will beme
i did the preview about this tablet before i buy it it is a good tablet for the price and it is not too heavy
while the fire hd tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive unit for basic web surfing email and especially shopping on amazon web site this tablet performs well although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some site the screen resolution is what i would call adequate but not on par with other high resolution and far more expensive tablet out there overall i am pleased with this tablet so far
i bought this for my son and ended up leaving with one for myself for a tablet i cannot mplain it doe what it say and ha expendable memory my son love his and i m satisfied with mine
i m a traditionalist who love real book and buy mostly hardvers a a nsequence i resisted getting a kindle for a long time i ll have to admit now that i wish i d gotten one sooner a tremendous amount of research must have gone into the way reader interact with real book because nothing about the kindle get in way of actual reading
i bought this primarily to be used a a kindle ereader and this is a good product for this st the only drawback is that i cannot access all the apps available on the google playstore and have to be ntent with what is available on the amazon app store
it ha sleep timer capability alarm i use it at work or use it at home while i m in the shower and i ll bring it to friend house and we use alexa to gain information or just have fun quality a it loud too
got this for my hisband who is totally not tech savvy he ha been able to download some game for himself plus navigate a little bit on here a major step for him
lightweight good screen quality a bit slow but a good purchase
light weight easy to take with u from reading to facebook for all your little need
love this i usually read at night so i do not need a light on to use the kindle to read
bought this for my granddaughter and she love it
love this for my youngest he had a nabi but it just wa not a user friendly a this is
i use to have the original but it didnlight up so it wa a deal breaker for me now i can read anywhere at anytime
i wanted to find away to get rid of my extra cable box and that wa it it give me even more than my smart device
my family and i are enjoying alexa great for playing music setting timer adding to shopping list etc still finding new and useful thing to do with it
our family ha made a echo a part of our ordinary day to day life from playing music to asking question to just playing with the thing
we love it that is me my wife my son daughter in law grand girl all love it
i m very glad that i made this purchase i do not often bring my mputer with me when i travel i enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the paperwhite
i had a lower end kindle for year when that broke i decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit the back litghting is nice for reading at night but the touch feature are too jumpy it jump page instead of just turning to the next one it is cumbersome to buy through amazon and difficult to see the list of what you have i do not know if i d buy this one over the lowest end one again
small light but mfortable to hold with either hand if you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting the battery last for week lovin it so far
work great for asking question that we used to google the sound from speaker is good ask alexa to play music is a go to you need to purchase amazon prime to have access to music but there is movie streaming also and free shipping make that a good value
i love my alexa i renamed her mputer because of star trek we have so much fun listening to music playing game and telling her to clean the house with our neato botvac or turn on the sprinkler with our rachio irrigation ntroller a we learn more ol thing this personal assistant can do the happier i am we purchased one we like it so much we purchased another for our bedroom and a dot for our daughter room they work together a an interm system too so no more yelling for one another or texting admit it you do it too we can now just drop in and talk to one another i am planning to ntinue purchasing item that alexa can ntrol and look forward to the advancement in personal assistant technology so many thing she can do already i highly remmend getting or or
i am very impressed with the tablet for the price it is great apps load up quick and look great on the tablet the o is easy to navigate
this is the best gift anyone uld receive talk to you wake you up sings you to sleep turn light off i love this thing
this is a great product very inexpensive and a great gift for child
i bought it for my medium room it is great faster than the previous version
we have several kindles and this is the latest version it packed with amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for u this new version me with gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great one problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your acunt so if they are for different family member kid they may end up with the same stuff on them my kid mainly use them for game apps and youtube video which am seem to work great the sound is good and the hd video is nice overall happy with it and the price wa good for this type of tablet
easy to install and worked great highly remmend
i purchased of these on the black friday sale each and received them in day had to wait until christmas to have them opened by my kid to see their potential great tablet and feature especially kid mode but have only one mplaint so far one of the tablet had a bad digitizer right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet hence only giving this item a star rating a this issue should never happen right out of the package however bestbuy is doing everything to make sure i m a happy customer by price matching when the item is available mpletely sold out everywhere other than that issue this tablet is user friendly fast processing web browsing decent battery life and great wifi connection doe not drop signal like other tablet would remmend
i looked at several brand and read review of tablet before making my purchase and the amazon fire wa by far the best i purchased mine from best buy and they had a great price le than i highly remmend this product it ha plenty of room for game book or just to search the web i love it
this is a great starter tablet or tablet or kid i bought one for myself and gave two a gift my daughter love hers and u it for homework game video and video chatting with my sister i use mine to play game and web browse a well a watch video when i am waiting somewhere i love the amazon music feature and use it to listen to music both in my car with the bluetooth feature and my bluetooth speaker system i have amazon prime so my experience ha allowed me to get the most out of my tablet but i cannot imagine using it without prime my only gripe is that device on the same prime acunt overlap ntent which is a bit innvenient when i am trying to keep my ntent separate from my daughter is it is still a great buy and i am satisfied with my purchase
this tablet ha so many apps with game movie and book that it keep my nephew entertained for hour on end
i have one in every room it doe everything from playing music getting info and i use it for an alarm clock
i bought this a a gift and my nephew really enjoys it
the smart home integration in this device is amazing great sounding speaker with a full rich sound voice regnition is very good uld hear me from across the room with no problem
from me to me love this tablet and the price wa
i love just being able to wake up in the morning and telling alexa to play my music so simple and amazing that is just a beginning of what it will do ask anything most of the time it is answered just awesome
in the two week that we have had the echo we have put it to a number of u and have hooked it up two are samsung smartthings home automation system it take some tuning and learning to understand what work but it doe work reasonably well interpreting what you are saying a long a the environment is not too noisy it is very nvenient to be able to put on music
we love it kid n all everyday use for u we do not use cable a much ch a b
i absolutely remmend this product to anyone who ha a amazon prime acunt very good sound from the speaker highly remmend
this is a good tablet for child and adult too however there is an issue with the port and charger cable we did not even have this tablet week before it would barley charge took it back to best buy and they said they uld not fox it and imagine the port is not vered under the manufacturer warranty so now i have a tablet that take a uple day to charge it really frustrating
got a great item for a great price i m totally in love with this item well worth the price
i previously purchased this item for my son and daughter a christmas present they both enjoyed it so much and indicated they used it primarily to play music and ask question they have also used it to utilize the alexa skill i e playing game use a a timer etc i purchased this item in anticipation of the impending integration with the sonos speaker system which i have installed throughout the house i am very excited to learn that the integration is ming soon and will provide another review once i have had an opportunity to operate my sonos speaker via voice mmand
for the price this is an excellent tablet i have a high end laptop that doe nvert to tablet but at almost and the foldover design i normally just use it in laptop mode i also have a high end phablet sized phone so i wa not sure how often i d use a tablet and did not want to spend ish on an ipad the fire ha been a great in between so far on day i use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day and do not have the need to use my laptop the speed is zippy the screen clarity quality is good enough storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable for now i use a gb card giving me a total of gb but the expandable can go up to gb tying into amazon is nice since i have amazon prime basic web surfing email facebook work great the only bad feature is the camera video quality but that doe not matter to me since i have my high quality camera video rerder on my phone only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen lor brightness uniformity is perfect to my eye once it is up running really enjoying the kindle mponent for book magazine reading a well overall probably the best i have spent in a long time
good product did care for the remote but product still good
a a video streaming device the fire tv is great especially if you re a prime member it is more powerful than most medium box on that market especially if you re into gaming which is where that extra juice shine in fact ton of android game play great on it you do not even need the optional ntroller for most of them and there is something to be said for playing candy crush on the big screen but for more serious game like grand theft auto tale from borderland modern mbat or knight of the old republic really well you might want to invest in a ntroller for some of them though not all game support the ntroller natively so do your research they run very smooth and without any noticeable frame rate drop though most android game do not really push the hardware anyway so this should me a no surprise but at the very least this doe mean you ll be able to play top of the line android game for several year with no problem some apps have their own version specifically for the fire tv so you ll want to make sure to get those one if available you also may be wondering what the difference is between the model and the previous launch model well not much the newer box is capable of a k output whereas the older version only went up to p but since most people do not even own k tv this feature probably wonbe too useful that said it is nice future proofing a k tv beme more and more standard the fire tv will be ready there are smaller change here and there but i m not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what anyway if you re looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual netflix youtube hulu and of urse amazon also let you play android game and play them well it is worth noting that you cannot access the google play store without rooting the system to install it first though even then only a limited selection of google play apps is even mpatible with the fire tv a of now so it might not be worth the trouble especially when amazon usually offer mparable if not the same exact apps anyhow but it is worth pointing out all the same
sturdy nstruction withstands toddler use or abuse
greate good love it watch what every i wonsjdhfhdhhsjx
easy to carry easy to read easy to get book and download nice to have a dictionary within your book able to download book newspaper or magazine
easy to set up and user friendly this is my send device we have added to our home
amazon is kindle fire line only get better a price get lower this is my rd kindle fire purchased the first still work well after daily use for more than yr a sleeker new design make the product look more relevant some definate improvement over the earlier version include the rear camera moving the charging port to the top and a crisper clearer screen the operating system seems to have been upgraded a well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini mputer which i think help it a well hold a charge for a good while under normal use am already thinking about replacing the other to the newer generation model absolutely will remmend amazon kindle fire to anyone who will listen
this is a kid friendly tablet good for gaming and learning game a well glad we got it
voice regnition is astounding with only a few hang ups mostly because of my accent great app to aid alexa in to do and list new skill are added often to even further alexa is u only thing i would change is the ability to connect to another bluetooth speaker for pandora radio
purchased for a xmas present and it ha lived up to the hype
this wa so much fun after we set it up in our kitchen
i already had the kindle fire and this kf not only ha a bigger picture screen but is faster
this wa perfect for entertaining my month old great grandson during car trip shopping and bedtime
i purchased this tablet for my daughter and within day after purchasing it the screen went mpletely blank it wa not dropped and didnget wet it is also very limited to apps you can download on it many apps would not work after being installed i would not remmend buying this tablet
i am so glad i purchased the paperwhite it make reading better at night because of little glare and dimmer than my fire or ipad wa finding it hard to justify buying it but i m really glad i did
there are definitely better tablet out there but being able to read book surf the internet and play game for is a no brainer
my year old niece cracked her screen on her former tablet i needed to get her a replacement this tablet fit the bill exactly a great screen relatively fast cpu and best of all it is cheap i wa able to find instruction online for installing google playstore in which i then gave her the tablet she love it
i can say it doe regnize every accent but there were too many question unanswered
this is a very good product my kid do homework on it
i love my kindle voyage it is light and oh so easy to use it is wonderful to have so many book in a portable format
great tablet work well wa a good gift for a begiiner
i bought this hoping to get a responsive android streamer but wa disappointed with the performance and the k that wa somewhat limited i decided to return this and get an nvidia shield which offer more value instead
steep learning curve great for music and ntrolling light
the amazon fire tablet ha came along way since the kindle version this is a full android tablet loaded with many great feature price range make it excellent for kid too
lovely upgrade for my sister from an old ipad gen
it is extremely light weight and easy to carry around great resolution i also purchased the protective ver
the device work a advertised with very little set up
this amazon fire is on fire meaning that it is a hot buy at best buy it doe everything i need it to do have not had any problem
great buy and good starter for a smart home if you got all accessory
wife love this thing she read nonstop on it she cannot put it down
i bought it cause i wanted to read more that didnhappen i tried and i just cannot read on device i need old school paper between my hand
i bought this to add voice ntrol to my smart thing light and other device it wa easy to integrate and work very well also purchased an echo dot for verage in a send room only slightly disappointed that the assistant is not a smart a the google app on my phone still pretty good though
it doe not always know what you are saying but for the most part it pick it up pretty well i hope it get better with time for the amount of thing you can ask it to do but for now it is totally worth it
i wa looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my need
the fire tablet is a a great size and work well a an e reader there are also some nice apps available but i wa disappointed that although it is billed a an android tablet i wa unable to use some apps available from the android store
i bought my kindle about month ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge
the fire tv with quad re processor is significantly faster than the older dual re make using streaming a breeze
easy to use and great parental ntrols to limit or access ntent
it is been very helpful around the house and i now plan on buying dot to place in certain section of my house
fire tv box is awesome i use it everyday love streaming k ntent super smooth streaming especially me with alexa it is a must have never need a cable box or dvr again add an sd card and plenty of room for game all your apps

i am absolutely in love with my alexa echo she is so easy to use and her voice rengination never give me any trouble
great product for a great price cannot get any better
i have been thinking about getting an echo for my family room i am glad i did we listen to music the news etc if you have an amazon prime acunt you will get even more out of it i love it when my grandson me over i play lullaby to put him to sleep i cannot wait to try some of the other feature
have several dot those that i want to play music over i have hooked into an external speaker rather that spend close to on a sonos speaker plus the st of the dot i choose the echo a the best solution for the bathroom got the white lor fit great on chair rail white rd is easy to hide one unforeseen issue is that it doe go load enough that i have to wait for a break in the music before i can ask alexa to skip or turn down volume
i uld not pa this one up for the money buy them for your kid so they can stay occupied for hour and get fat
hello is is good product to have and buy i would trevmoned it
good if use of tablet is low and not very mplex lor quality is only average
work great until i had forgotten that amazon fire did not me with google playstore i looked up how to add playstore to the fire there are many video on youtube that showed how to add playstore to the fire all seemed to add it ok but the loss performance of the fire wa noticeable there were several apps that failed to work at all or lost feature one example wa lifetime it wa slow to load and failed to bring up chromecast one reason i hoped for this app would work wa my samsung and vizio smart tv is do not offer this app i found a old tablet i had forgotten i had i loaded lifetime and work perfect i guess what it boil down to it you are after apps on the playstore get a non amazon tablet it is just easier to use apps should work and you do not have to fool around trying to adapt playstore if playstore is not critical then i m sure this a a great little table

all my friend had the amazon fire stick but i wa not sold on streaming video since am a crazed videophile when i read about the firetv i decided i wa ready to try it out i must say that i have beme a huge fan of youtube and the video quality of some ntent in k is amazing this is a good upgrade over the firestick
i bought it for my mother in law i am her favorite now she love it
this wa an affordable device that allowed me to play music while at work it also doe quite a bit more but this wa my use of the product it wa le expensive than the ipod
i love the echo it is super user friendly and the sound is great for the size
upgraded from first generation kindle work better than expected
great tablet for kid they love it it is also great that you can download music and movie through amazon prime
good product for the price obviously it is not a simple to use a ipad or galaxy but still a great option for those who do not want to break the bank
friend were pleased with gift will be buying one for their family
the fire is performing everything i would wish for in a tablet browser is working fine and i enjoy reading on it
bought this mainly for my grandkids to play the time limit you can set is great because they do not argue about who is on the most
we are trying to make a smart house and alexa here is the best alexa turn on everything we ask her to a long a we do not speak too fast she is great for telling news brief weather update sport fact and nversions she even play the amazon playlist if i am in the other room she can still hear me if i speak a bit louder i love alexa
the kindle paper white is great for anyone who like to read on the run the clarity of the type and the lack of glare make this perfect for any reading environment
my previous kindle is home page wa more intuitive than the paperwhite i just bought
the amazon stick very nice and easy to set up i would remmend it
it is a bit flimsy but doe stand up so i m not mplaining
this is a great starter tablet for an year old
i bought this to replace a year old kindle fire hdx that i had just dropped on the floor i sort of panicked so after doing a uple of hour of research i picked this tablet just to be on the safe side i got additional gb of memory i installed a uple of game none of them memory hog and a okbook app in addition to downloading a uple of book and dictionary i can honestly say this is the slowest tablet i have ever had just rotating the screen take sends and that is if there is only one app open opening a book or magazine cannotake half a minute and god help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you re oking amazon is obviously more ncerned about showing you nstant special offer and apps than having satisfied customer since there are no other fire tablet available for whatever reason maybe they re being disntinued i ll be replacing it with either an ipad or a galaxy tablet
i love this box family time with my family a a very low price
i purchased this tablet for my year old niece and it work great no issue at all she mainly u it to watch barney and elmo episode easy to setup parental ntrols for safety easy to handle especially for a child very small and lightweight remmend to all
work great love watching all my show from a single source now
love alexa she doe some much great sound level for music
wanted something to take with me i do not use a smart phone quick look at the web when i m away from the desktop also some game
it wa a good gift for the price and had many feature and option
great for reading at nightlight is perfect on the screen
amazon fire tv ha everything you will ever need in term of streaming i only carry local cable channel since purchasing this box
got a great deal from best buy on amazon echo during a day sale event use echo a a untertop speaker more than anything else in our dining area kitchen and the sound clarity is amazing ha turned into a great every day mpanion
amazon tap is awesome very happy with the purchase
i recently dropped my cable provider and i had been using the amazon firestick which work great the fire tv wa on sale and since we have tv i bought it uld not believe the beautiful picture on my samsung tv i subscribed to hbo amazon prime and showtime so i dropped my monthly bill with directv from to and i have a ton more ntent
old charger wa taking forever to charge the device so i went in to best buy and found this mparable charger and it work great
overall the echo is a fun product to own we typically use it for listening to music finding out about the weather forecast or having her tell rny joke eventually we ll start linking it to wifi thermostat but that ha not happened yet
i m high tech in most way but have always been a traditionalist when it me to book i love the feel of paper in my hand this wa my first ebook reader and i m surprised to be satisfied i have read more in the past month than i had in the previous year i have no mplaints about it at all small and durable light work great and is easily adjustable i thought i would hate the advertisement but it is really just on the screen when the power is off then it go away when you start to read i mostly use overdrive for library book and it is a bit of a pain since you need a mputer and the kindle but it is well worth it
fast streaming easy setup doe provide biased option to push amazon product however great product overall
love my echo cant wait to learn how many thing she doe lot of fun
this wa very easy to set up and user friendly a
overall a great sound from a small package price may be a little high for the money but other than that a great purchase
look nice cannot wait to try it out great price for a tablet
ordering from amazon is simpler than ever use this in any room for sound a well when you are not making an order
for something so small it ha enough processing power to do what it need to for a travel reader graphic are also decent for the size
wa a great black friday find i enjoy playing on it it is easy to use
this kindle is by far the best really enjoy the weight of it and ease on the eye while reading
work good got it at the best price the capability to read at night is totally worth the money
great tablet for kid but the screen is not a strong charging port is very poorly built
love the speaker and the assistance of alexa wa trying to choose between this and a regular bluetooth speaker and this wa a better choice for my need
this is such a neat gadget my daughter absolutely love it
this wa a replacement for my son who is original kindle broke he like it a lot just wish we uld figure out how to get all the old ntent we had bought from the old one into the new one
bought this for my nephew for christmas who ha been asking for a tablet it wa on sale for an outrageous deal and uld not pa up work fine and he love it would remend
really ol product want to learn how to use it more
i have had a kindle for year but with two granddaughter fighting for tablet usage i purchased this fire tablet for double duty theirs and mine i have always loved to read in bed but also love to highlight passage and mark page which is hard to do while lying in bed this tablet let me read numerous book at once whichever one strike my mood or connects to what is on my mind i have not really used it for book with the grandkids they like to watch favorite video or play kid game gotta remember to juice it up for when they show up unannounced
purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle she love it great product
i think alexa is the best have to buy the other smart mponents but so far so good
this thing is super fun to play with it amazing how microsoft apple or google didnme out with something like this before amazon of all mpanies did work incredibly well
i really loved my in but i love in a whole lot thanks guy
love it best purchase so far this year better than the wifi fire stick
got for my year old grandson durable plenty fast for his game no more squenting to see his phã²ne
i find it easy to use but the kindle doe not me with instruction so you have to find your way around
we were notcrazy about the idea of getting another portable electronic device that distracted her from her schoolwork th grader need to read much more than previous year and the paperwhite not only enurages reading but eliminates the clutter that occurs from many paperback the screen is the perfect size lighting more than adequate and the functionality is ideal
definitely a good product child of all age in elementary school
i bought this item on a whim and because it wa on sale i have been pleasantly surprised search sound great for it size
got the fire stick and the fire tv i like that i can plug the tv straight to the router with ethernet cable seems to load page faster and stream better with sling tv both are great item
doe the job when i travel and i would remmend to a friend
my husband and i purchased of these for each of our kiddos and to say they re a hit would be a massive understatement and the parental ntrols on these are awesome we love our new fire
lot of pre installed apps fast o and rf remote
excellent value for small laptop lenovo screen with flash memory microsoft word for year
this is the best thing in town i love how quick it responds to mmands i enjoy the nice quality of music all day long
my dad loved it for his father day gift from all his son
i picked this up during black friday and managed to get it cheaper than msrp my girlfriend and i have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else it is very useful and since we were notlooking for anything with deep feature it wa well worth the price
my daughter always want one she got this one she love it
my previous generation kindle paperwhite got scratched a little on the screen so i debated about picking up a new kindle but it wa worth the the th generation paperwhite ha twice the memory run a bit faster so it is noticeably quicker in response making highlighting and annotating easier and the uneven screen lighting problem the older kindle had shadow spot on the bottom edge of the screen ha been solved my only mplaint is that amazon ntinues to put ad on the kindle which you have to pay to get rid of it is almost necessary because i use the kindle to view book in church very inappropriate when the ad for a murder crime or romance novel pop up a a screensaver
i bought this fire for my year old and she love it
i would remmend this to anyone who enjoys amazon excellent value
bought it for the kid to play with i like it so far bought is few accessory to allow them to play with it
i am very pleased with the purchase i use alexa to listen to my favorite tunein radio station in a foreign untry set timer when i m oking ask the time in different city in the world or basic culture question she responds to everything if i want to play music she will default to amazon prime if you have the membership it is very nvenient to have alexa i have even placed order on amazon with my voice i also have hue light so alexa is the one turning off my house light at the end of the day ah and i can ask her to do so from the upstairs level i think this purchase is one of the best i have made this year i am sure there is much more to tap on no pun intended and i ll find out a i use echo more for now i totally remmend
i install the echo in le than min and wa using it and asking all kind of question

feel durable and battery last a long time the screen is easy to read
if you can jail break it it will be a nice product
i didnneed one of these but it seemed so ol i took a chance a year and a half later and i do not think i uld get along without her shopping list to do list i never get to store and forget why i went you can be in your kitchen while you re throwing out an empty egg carton and just tell alexa to add it to your shopping list when you get to the store it is there no running around making list and forgetting them check the weather settle argument it wa easy to set up and just get easier to use
i purchased this product with an eye on simply trying out a tablet it ha beme a product i use every day you have to get used to the amazon app store which is different than the google play store though it is still android based the tablet is fast and the user experience is satisfying i purchased the gb model for the extra storage space it is a great tablet for under
cannot beat the price decent size make a great gift this holiday season

i bought one of these tablet for my year old son and he love it very user friendly and many option of game and apps for free at amazon
bought this for a friend it doe the job basic web and book reading and at an affordable price nothing too fancy but no problem
the tablet is excellent very fast and well worth the money the display is great
it is very good but very limited to the number of application that it can support
this is a great e reader there is no glare it is easy on the eye
fast easy and mobile connects through wifi and directly easy to move from one room to another
i love the amazon fire it is very similar to other tablet without the heavy price tag

i bought this tablet for my year old son and it is an amazing tablet it ha two different user option available one which an adult can use a a regular tablet and one just for kid with a password keeping them from messing with thing they should not have access to i am loading it with the digital downloads of movie so my kid can watch it in the car on the go for anyone interested in that all you do is download it to the amazon play on the adult user side go into setting and select share for the movie you want your child to have on their side it is great if your child need a tablet but you do not want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charge on game
this is the send amazon dot purchased and it keep getting better
learning all the aps that are on the kindle the game and all the free book
in my opinion this model is too small and feel cheap and sd card slot
i m very accustomed to using verbal mmands with my samsung galaxy same experience
got this a a present for my son he like to read and watch show in youtube for his age i think this is perfect it doe the same a ipad mini
it a great device sound is amazing throughout the house
the screen is easy to read even on the beach and i love being able to download a new book at any time

fire tv is the best stream box in the market it is really easy to setup and if you are a prime member you ll love it
love my echo still learning what i can and cannot do wa surprised to get a message from two friend the other night on alexa
it doe what it supposed to do turn ur tv into a smart tv altho chromecast ha the upper hand because of it lack or chuggy connection to mobile phone
we are all taking advantage of my husband gift very useful
the ease of alexa in performing function is send to none siri who
purchased the kindle paperwhite prior to an international trip it wa well worth the investment i created my own book ver black since one wa not available orange i do not think so from the store at the time of purchase
this tablet is technically my rd tablet i always look for something cheap and useful i also am always looking for tablet that i know i can easily replace without cringing if my son destroys them this tablet ha been the best so far i love the limitation i can place for my son is usage and the fact i can specify on what they can spend time on battery time is really good i usually have to charge it every other day even after heavy usage it doe take a while before it need to be charged wish there wa more apps and i have had issue with certain apps but it may just be those developer issue and not the tablet itself
i bought this for my mom for christmas she is not tech savvy and she love it and is able to slowly figure it out
good device for a school age child nvent use easy download
wa a learning curve but once you get the hang of it it wa okay
this is a great tablet it is reasonably priced and ha great quality
very good for in bed watching of amazon prime show not a fast a other option but excellent for the price
so far it is working well it doe answer some question but not a far advanced a your i phone doe yet however i have nfidence that the echo will be be ntinually learning a amazon upgrade it
this is my first time use for bluetooth amazing ecchor is not just bluetooth they also can help you answer a lot impomation you need to know good stuff to have
perfect for our young daughter it a perfect size and she can use it very easily
i bought it for a kid i asked her about and she said she like it in add it is not expensive
what a great price and very easy to use had a little trouble getting past my secured connection though
better than the nook i switched fro glowlight nook due the lack of previous feature the nook did not improve so i wa forced to switch i found in the kindle all i need plus more book from amazon
we got this for our three year old daughter at first she wa not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my ipad
i love this kindle it is a replacement for one which wa almost year old when the built in light stopped working i used it nstantly for hour every day carried it in my purse all the time and traveled with it i will not be without a kindle replacing it wa a foregone nclusion but i still read the review just in case
love everything only negative is the ad my year old daughter ha claimed it a her own and operates easily
my kid read book play game take picture they love this
i absolutely love my kindle it is wonderful and i probably nsider it my best friend
so far ha done essentially thing i have asked of it it ha so many more capability so i have just scratched the surface but i very happy only rating a because i have not utilized to it full potential will be buying three more next month for employee
great for reading nice image easy on the eye and lightweight
such a great purchase it is way better than i had anticipated wish i would have bought one sooner
the protective rubber guard work so well easy parental ntrols
the kindle paperwhite is an improvement over older generation kindle is with it is clearer display cleaner font and built in light it is an e reader that anyone can use with very little technical capability and make for an enjoyable reading experience
i like this because it play all prime music on amazon and all you have to do is tell alexa what you would like to hear and it will play it for you we use it by our pool all the time and the kid have instant music i use it daily for the weather and i always know how to dress for the day i am nstantly learning more and more from alexa
love it and would remmend it for the young a the old
i already have an ipad but never felt like it wa made for reading so i checked this at the store and love how it made me feel feeling like reading a real book but you also have some feature a it is an e reader enjoy carrying it in backpack purse light weight with perfect small size
bought this gift for my boyfriend for christmas very easy to order amazon product
this is a wonderful e reader but i hate that you can only store book on the device it take up way too much space
it wa the best christmas present for my grandson
it wa just a described i would remmend it to a friend
love talking to alexa to tell it to ntrol temp what to play what to mix
how cannot you like a cheep tablet that almost doe everything a ipad doe i bought this a a book reader but it is so much more
i think this is a great ereader i think even better than the oasis that just came out i do like that one but i love that this one seems sturdier and offer the automatic brightness adjustment and the vibration feedback when turning page one thing i didnt like wa that it wa hard to find where the page turn area were at while reading in the dark to remedy this i bought a few aluminum button sticker and put them on the line of the device
out of the box this wa easy to set up and even easier to use
work great but should have been included with the purchase of the kindle not more dollar
this is the third power charger that i have had to buy at st of over each since my kindle fire purchase why cannot the charger last a reasonable amount of time when i connected this charger i received a message saying that it wa a low level charger it probably would not charge while the kindle wa in use not acceptable for this st
great
amazon fire add a new dimension to tv watching so much easier to use than other remote
replaced older kindle with paper white light ntrol akers reading in dark area better than non paper white model
uld not be happier with this latest kindle e reader love being able to turn page by pushing a button and the bright uniform lighting it is a big step up from my first generation paperweight
love it and have never had any issue with the fire tv box
overall i m pleased with the kindle paperwhite the text is sharp and easy to read the memory is more than adequate for all the book i uld want to have available battery life is excellent going for week without charging it doe not get star from me though the processor is a bit slow causing a time lag to go from screen to screen or to navigation page i also have kindle on my note and appreciate the lag free response of the samsung navigation is a bit cumbersome since there are no physical button the back button in particular is missed having a dedicated kindle device with great battery life and an amazing screen make the paperwhite worth having for me in spite of a few area where it can be improved
got it for my three year old and it is perfect for him
bought this a a nd tablet for my mom gor xmas it been well over month it is still going amazingly well
my kid love the amazon fire great for all age love parent ntrol option great for every day on the go use from movie game reading and even to keep track of email and friend
i am really happy with my echo so far it ha been very easy to use although we havent mpletely figured out all the function it wa fairly easy to set up
i bought this e reader because i wanted to use it at the river and by the pool and still be able to see the screen in the sunlight the kindle paperwhite didndisappoint mpact and a step above the basic e reader
this is really good if you read a lot doe not strain your eye and very light weight only demerit is cant use in night if there is not enough light
excellent improvement over my first kindle which wa the original love the backlight for reading at night
get amazon prime movie netflix youtube but apps are very limited no facebook cannot get any good game that i know of and i do not need the premium movie channel because i get them with my cable enables me to use my older tv which is not a smart tv to access these service good deal might get another one for the guest room which ha no cable box and the same type of tv
i have purchased in the last few month and have been pleased with the product
great tablet and very cheap used to for gift for customer and ita amazing
google is releasing their mpetitor to alexa but so far the review make it sound like it doe not mpete yet alexa is a great mpanion to your amazing prime acunt you do not have to have prime but you probably should it is voice regnition a very impressive and it is list of ability grows by the week
perfect for my busy family we can all watch show and without having to watch them the day they run lot of extra and easy to use
everyone in the family can enjoy asking alexa question where it doe not know everything it doe seem to get better the skill available are fairly diverse and useful this is a good place to start if you are interested in having a smart home i bought the echo and the dot with the battery pack
a little slow but overall good first tablet for kid
this came in handy when our mputer had to go to the pc hospital it wa nvenient quick easy to use
bought one for my great nephew and one for my grandson both year old and it is perfect price and what they can do
you cannot beat what you get out of this tablet for the money easy to download play store and install actual apps pro price ease of use expandable storage battery life n screen resolution low ram not for high powered game
excellent device light weight and easy on eye next time i ll get a black one instead of the white to minimize glare in sunlight
my little girl love her kindle i m so happy i bought an upgrade to her previous kindle best christmas gift ever
you always go back to the product brand that serf you well great price for the top rated quality
i wa looking for a reader that i uld use outdoors and found this device to be excellent outdoors the battery life thus far ha been excellent it took some adjustment going from my kindle fire to the kindle paperwhite overall i am very happy with this new device
v kindle fire hd v for the price pretty darn ol lot faster than my old fire hd do not like the display screen to much app clutter wifi not the best for speed connection tested over connection all in all for reading kid an easy device and fast yea it is good buy just do not expect miracle speed a lot of bell and whistle or anything fancy i like it imho
no problem the unit work a apple ha explained with little or no effort
work for what my mom wanted it for some of the question we ask alexa she doe not know but i guess they will work on getting updated information
good if you want something inexpensive and will do the minimum very well
doe everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really cannot beat it
picked this tablet up on black friday what a great deal work awesome and ha all of the amazon apps
i love the paperwhite and we have had kindles in the house for year this paperwhite is a snappy a the voyage and while it doe not have that smooth glass screen it also doe not have the extra or so price tag it is a great piece of tech that often go on sale get it when it doe it is well worth it
got this a a gift for someone easy to set up and they are enjoying it immensely
i love it good bye apple tv and roku a must have for the digital age
i m loving it i have got it for month now and im very happy with it it feel very fast and reliable also the interface feel very friendly and easy to use
once it is programmed it work great it is a wave for the future for voice programming
great tablet good for kid and the whole family
i bought this one my niece and she love it she also take it on long road trip
acrding to the info the paperwhite charge faster with the charger made for a kindle but i think any brand will work it came in a package deal when i bought my paperwhite otherwise i would have skipped it used what i have been using for my old kindle i gave it star because i like it but feel it is overpriced
it not only is is speaker but also integrates many of the other application that make your home easier and nvenient so far i have had this echo for aver a month and i am very satisfied with the product
i have owned three version of the amazon echo the original the dot and the tap this is the most versatile of the three the wireless recharging is great the sound is not a good a the original but the portability make up for this at it wa a fantastic buy
i purchased kindles for my grandchild for christmas last year i have been very disappointed with their quality the charger were very difficult to plug in right from the beginning and now one of the kindles woneven charge at all the others have to be positioned just right or they woncharge either i definitely would not remmend this particular model kindle to anyone
bought this for my son and he absolutely love it
bought two for small boy to use instead of being on the phone and i really like it easy to link acunt good parent lock on it and easy enough to navigate
i didnthink it would be that much of an improvement over the paperwhite but taking all of the advance together it definitely beat it the st is high but having that crisp of a screen is worth it obviously when you can buy a kindle fire hd for le you have to be dedicated to the look and functionality of an e ink reader for this to be worth it if you love e ink book and want a much better lighting solution than the kindle paperwhite this is the best option
i have two of these for my kid age and they are great for them to watch cartoon and they are slowly getting into the puzzle book and game on them easy to setup and link to amazon acunt only gave it star because the one downfall is that these tablet are bit on the slow side when either downloading ntent or loading up some video kid are le patient than adult you know overall well worth the money
much better than the echo dot wa able to buy this for promotion
upgraded from st generation fire tablet decided to go with gb tablet and there were none in store so i had to order for free delivery to store arrived on day promised wa easy to sync new tablet with older tablet very nice picture and video great value
ha good sound but when it me to answering mmands it seems to be a little on the ignorant side
i bought my new kindle paperwhite because it ha the lighted background work perfectly
i love the way we can program it for my grand
this fire tv is an excellent streaming device one of the best thing about it is it is able to stream k big upgrade over the fire stick if you have a k tv also the micro sd card slot is nice to have it is also very mpact the one thing you will need to pick up is an hdmi cable it doe not me with one
i like that you can access thousand of movie or tv show just make sure you have enough speed on your router
i downloaded dozen of book and stream movie and tv with no problem in a wi fi setting the battery life is not too great i can stream for about hour and need a recharge but it is great for the price
i decided to get a kindle because i wa having issue reading on my backlit tablet the screen lighting on the paper white doe not have this issue i also like the lack of distraction i do not have e mail or text popping up while i m trying to read
download can be slow at time overall good product
this is a great buy for music news and any kind of information you want
just perfect thank you
love my amazon is amazing for the price i paid and what the tablet doe i am glad not pay for a samsung tablet more expensive and do the same
i like my echo because of the thing it can do tell me
my son is and he love it so easy to use it is great
i wa actually a usability tester on the very first kindle and i d always thought about buying one after using the kindle app on various tablet ipad and samsung i finally realized that what i wa mostly using the tablet for wa the kindle app buying one wa a no brainer and the paperwhite is excellent the bookerly font is exceedingly readable and the backlighting is adjustable so that i do not keep my significant other awake when i m reading in bed it is lightweight and the perfect size for putting in the pocket of my cargo short or in a jacket pocket
it doe it job
it is a nice upgrade from the screen size is just right for small kid hand reading kindle book is much easier
this wa brought for husband he wore out his first kindle excellent value
pick this up on impulse love it have to go take it from the kid all the time
great product use it every day to watch movie and tv show
this great for the money but it wonlet you use spotify
this is one of the best gadget i have bought it feel a if one is reading a real book battery life which last almost a month on moderate reading
very slow device for most adult probably fine for a child
we bought this for my year old usin so she uld download library book play card game and most importantly watch what her kid and grandkids post on facebook i myself have a fire and found it very easy to use
have been doing exactly what it is intended to and only wish it more intuitive
if we were going off of percentage this would get a this improves greatly over the old fire stick with a faster processor k support and the freedom to install rd party apps this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you uld ever need the only gripe i have is that it is missing vudu otherwise it is one of the best streamer currently available
i have not put my fire tablet down since i got it at christmas time on sale got one for my wife and niece
work a described love the kid friendly foam protector it stopped working within month of purchase amazon just sent new one without a real fuss innvenient but no real fuss i hope this one last longer
my son love his tablet best if you buy some amazon gift credit for some game and apps
this product is so fun we got it for my dad for his birthday and he hooked it up right away and everyone had fun trying to stump alexa also we played every type of music and she got information on a restaurant for u and you can ntrol volume and everything by voice mmand it is the first robot we have in our home highly remmend this product i am buying another one today
i love the kindle fire i have a nook from a few year ago and the kindle ha so much more very user friendly great price
nice price drop to admittedly a device that make your prime membership much more sticky but love accessing prime music through it
bought for grandkids they love them wise choice i made
this fire wa for my daughter for her birthday she love it
not an exact fit in our house but an excellent speaker worth learning to use
mpact fast reliable very goodi am not a casual user of on demand ntent and device having tried smart tv is from brand smart dvd bluray player apple tv wdtv htpc chromecast and too many other mpeting product to mention for streaming ntent before this box you really had two option for a simple to use box that doe not require additional item or tweaking
perfect for beginner or for anyone that want great tablet at a great price although it is cheaper than when the original wa released it still ha the same greatness a it is predecessor for forth of the price
lot of good feature for the amazon member tablet is nice and fast
my google nexus suddenly died with blink of death so i got this for temporary tablet nice to have micro sd slot cannot find some of my needed apps yet like my bank maybe it is me it ha single speaker but if i want nice sound i ll use headphone maybe a touch dimmer than the nexus it fit my old bluetooth keyboard so i m good
work fine do not like the ad easy to use speed ok
better than original kindle fire definitely more functional
i m so excited when i got alexa she is hand free assistance while i m cleaning i can speak mmands to her or just ask question it is amazing how you can dual task i wish alexa uld work on voice mmand through the app though like a siri i also cannot wait for the echo dot to be released next month i need one in every room i would definitely remmend this
easy to set up durable for toddler highly remmend
i bought this tablet for watching movie and reading book it is also a great tablet because i can set my child on their own individual side and set up parental ntrols
this is the first time i buy a kindle product and the price is fairly good since i get the disunt the screen read like real paper but the background light i think is not necessary because it will reduce the quality of reading
only got four star because it is got to many preloaded apps i can not hide and i got this tab for my seven year old for christmas she love it though and it work great
i wa not sure if i needed this since i heard some are good some are not worth it if you own a smart phone but i bought one anyway i now own two alexa is one for the living room and one for my bedroom i love the simplicity of having two
i have been a book fan and wa surprised how much i love this
purchased a a gift for my husband he is not a tech person i wa afraid he would be intimidated but he love it
i have an i pad and the fire for the price you cannot beat the fire doe what the i pad doe and wa a fraction of the st
i wa worried that my son wa not going to like the software but he is having lot of fun with it
this little tablet wa a great purchase my kid used it on a long trip and they mostly watched video and played game the screen is pretty poor mpared to higher end model but it is pretty great for the price there are certainly superior tablet out there but if you need a cheap tablet this is certainly worthy of star for the class the operating system the touch screen and the screen quality themselves are drastically lower quality than a surface ipad or galaxy tablet but so is the price so a long a you are not expecting this device to rival an ipad retina screen you should be pleased
entertainment or the quiet time you love perfect
i would remmend this to my friend that you can shop on amazon ha many preloaded game many apps
i bought this tablet for my young grandchild and they just love it it is very easy for them to use and can be given a child profile
bought this tablet a a gift and so far they are happy with it i did the set up and i cannotell you it didnt lag or freeze so thats always a plus it run on the amazon app store i dont care for it cause it dont have a many apps a others other than that and the low memory i like it personally i download alot of game apps so i need lot of memeory but for my mother in law it just fine she like to read book on it she say it good for that also she wa able to get the library app and download free book so thats a plus
my son love his kindle perfect size and good price
very nice improvement from earlier model resolution better and greatly reduced sun glare certainly worth the investment
i bought this a is present for my year old grandma she love it very easy to operate no issue
i purchased this tablet a a christmas present when they were having a sale it is a good basic tablet that doe everything you uld want a tablet to do especially for the price i paid
this product is ok but is not the best you can get for a sale item fine battery life seems to be a little short bottom line so so
purchased this a a christmas gift for nephew he love his tablet his mom love it even more now that he can play some game on it tablet is not too heavy just put a protective case to protect your investment
the product met my need run very smoothly with an occasional lag but nothing significant greatly exceeded previous box i had which nstantly lagged and had problem loading mind you this box st doubled the st of the amazon box
bought this a a mother is day gift fit perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use
got of these for christmas gift for our grandson they love them
i bought one for both my kid and they love it we are very happy with the purchase
i think that it is easy to use and ha a really nice sound
great tablet for kid my son liked and easy to play with
wanted a reader that i uld just get and go on my way always have something to read apps are great easy for my yr old grandson to enjoy too
this is a very good starter tablet we have purchased several others that did not perform a well the no name brand do not have the clear display that this one doe
they make a great child proof ver and the battery life is descent so far
it is a great product for my son and i love bestbuy
i have been mpletely satisfied with this product the quality of graphic is great and downloads are a breeze i would definitely remmend this product
my daughter love the kindle fire and u it on a daily basis in school and at home
this device ha been a wonderful addition to our home the sound quality on this device is amazing
the first thought came into my mind after getting kindle paperwhite that why i didnbuy this thing earlier it is an awesome device i really didnthink that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book highly remmended
great tablet for my year old son reliable and durable for this age group
just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it it is easy to use and simple to set up
this tablet is light weight and thin which make it ideal to hold on my hand i love it
i gave a a gift to a kid who ha autism it ha been helping on his development a lot
fun gadget that ha more u than i realized a
bought the firestick after daughter got one and loved it went to get a send and they were out of stock wa told the firetv had faster processor and uld handle k do not have k and honestly it is not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference save money and buy the cheaper firestick
i m so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too everything about it is good and i really like it
i can ntrol both upstairs and downstairs nest thermostat play music set a timer and so much more by just saying alexia i would remmend it to anyone
bought this a a starter tablet for my mom easy to use with great price
i bought this for my wife who really like the amazon tablet she said she really enjoyed the very clear picture and how fast it wa like they say happy wife happy life
my review is not a review of the device a much a my opinion on which product to choose when trying to decide between this and google home google home is the closest mpetition in this landscape and it still lacking in mparison to alexa all of the interesting feature of google home are non existent or slowly being released using these feature a a selling point is disingenuous more than that google home nstantly ha trouble detecting my voice and doing any of the assistant mmands in the same environment the echo dot with budget hardware had better success rate when it did detect it the time to action wa x a long a google home is much more chatty
amazing deal quick and fast menu and k cant be beat
very fast very functional love the e reader function movie music and internet work great love it
it wa a gift for my girlfriend it is her first tablet it wa easy to get started and she u it a lot
better than the firestick because it ha more memory and also ha ethernet port so you can plug directly into box for faster result
perfect and easy for the kid to use keep them busy
this is the nd fire i purchased had to return the first due to a flaw creating an inability to connect to wifi so far this one work great use it mostly for reading
better then i thought very useful and easy to use set up wa a snap and work great
work great for checking the weather checking your calendar playing music and asking question
love device functional and easy set up enjoyed ability to just set up and use right away my child liked available apps on google play store
i had other tablet that worked terrible it would not even take e book from the library but this is the perfect balance between an e reader that uld get boring to some people a tablet that u up the battery real quick and you do not have to connect to a mputer to download the e book either which is a real nvenience so i would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really poor people that cannot afford to buy expensive electronics if they lose it break or get stolen they uld easily just go buy a brand new one the goal is to stay connected to the mainstream it is easy to carry on the bus bring to the park maybe a classroom or library dining room ffee shop and not a big worry about losing a lot of if it got lost plus with the amazon cloud you would never lose any of the e book that you paid for can use on all you device this should be nsidered a gift package from amazon especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very tablet always have to run to the library or borrow someone else is penny
i love everything about it i really enjoy it i use it alot
this is a pretty ol technology still learning what all it can do
i like what you get for the price but it is a little tricky for my kid to figure out so i do have to help them a lot
got this a a replacement for an ipad pro much more flexible a to third party add ons and after having both prefer the size of the fire hd
first purchase of an e reader kindle paperwhite is very refined after many generation of change on kindles device is responsive for loading and downloading new book backlight is easy to use and adjustable our library ha over book mpatible with kindle for checkout get the magnetic ver kindle brand or oem a it turn the device on and off with opening
good for the price hard to beat it â
i m glad i took the opportunity to buy the echo especially when it wa on sale
love this easy to use love that you can purchase external memory card for this tablet i am excited to say i purchased of these for family member and i am happy with the tablet

i purchased amazon fire for my son after reading enough review about this product it work ok for e book but very slow for internet streaming and downloading also the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button uples of time to make it work
a bargain this tablet is very affordable and the picture quality is very good
this is my first ereader and it doe not disappoint it is mfortable to hold and it is easy on the eye for extended reading the adjustable ntrols for lighting work great the only negative for me is that the ebooks my library system u are not mpatible with it if this is an issue check first
i bought this for my gf for her bday and she love
the kindle paper white is a great size and weight i live in new york so while i m on the train and cannot sit down to read this kindle offer nvenience because you can mfortably hold it in one hand i wa against e reader at first but after this purchase i definitely appreciate them
after much ntemplation between a kindle and a nook i went with kindle due to the number of kindle book purchase however i love the choice i made i wanted to be able to read at night without the light i can with this one and if i fall asleep then nothing is left on and i love not having to carry my heavy technical book around now either very happy with this purchase

if you are looking for big bank for your buck with an android tablet you can rarely go wrong with the amazon fire tablet and if you are invested in the amazon esystem you definitely should have this tablet

wa not planning on buying this but the price pulled me in glad i picked it up
no technology is ever like a real book you can smell but this little notebook in nice it doe so many thing well
take a little to figure out all the thing echo can do thinking about buying one for the bedroom
love it is really nice product and not expensive
for the price this is a great value i nsidered a laptop or larger tablet but am quite satisfied with this purchase
my grandkids loved getting their own tablet for christmas
i now have bedroom kitchen and shower area and i will be getting one for the medium room in the future i think that say it all the only down side is since it is operation is in the cloud if amazon server go down then it is a brick but you can connect to bluetooth on the phone and also use it a a bluetooth speaker there is one thing they uld fix and that is when the volume is up high then if you try to talk to the echo it cannot hear you and you ll have to manually turn it down
easy to read on and awesome battery life great price
this is one of the most amazing product i have ever purchased i highly remmend this product
great for my dad who ha trouble with smaller print he ha had no problem setting it up and getting started
got his tablet for my year old she so she uld play apps and watche video work great and to be able to add memory is a plus
i wa not looking for anything mplicated just something to read book on play a few game watch video at those thing it doe very well
it is okjust okhate the ad and the home screennot a good a original
it is somewhat of a step up from the roku i wa previously using but not a much a i wa expecting i think it is a uple firmware update away from being better than it is now spent the good part of the day trying to figure out why i uld only connect to my dual band router at ghz and not ghz hour on the phone with verizon fios tech support wa unsuccessful a other device connected at ghz without issue wa about to pack it up and return it until i called amazon tech support turn out it is a known issue that the firetv ha difficulty with ghz network that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel number above the tech support person said i should change the channel to or instead of automatic and it worked bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with showtime netflix sling plex and hulu it is fine through speaker but video lag slightly behind the audio using bluetooth audio and video are in perfect sync with bluetooth and amazon prime video which make me think it ll be fixed at some point a amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard gotta say i prefer the platform agnostic ui of roku with amazon world tucked away in an app the firetv navigation pane represents mostly amazon product with no option to modify it roku is ui is more about the medium le about the provider voice search work well if you want only to be presented with amazon is viewing option for some reason i thought search wa universal but only movie and tv show available through amazon show up bummer the firetv is ok le than i wa expecting and with other good option around the rner i m beginning to doubt my choice
bought the tablet for my kid and they love it i think it is prefect for them it is a little bulky but perfect for them
love to get up to date information on weather traffic and event in my area
this is the best streaming device in the market fast easy setup allows u program it and hookup peripheral device such a mouse keyboard firestick is only ghz so make sure to get the box it also ha ability to stream via hardwire

great gift for the whole family i like the music most of all tell joke and answer all your question bought one for a gift and one for myself
this ereader is very responsive it is the best reading experience besides having a physical book i would definitely remmend
easy to use and quick to set up even kid love to use it and picture are good
it wa a good buy for when the had them on sale i use it a my travel tablet
nice screen time limit for kid is a nice feature
first ereader ever bought and it ha been one of the best purchase ever have had no problem with it and it genuinely feel like you re reading a paperback book out of would remmend
i have an apple tv and wa skeptical at first to buy the aftv however i am so happy to have switched to the aftv so much freedom yes
this is my send kindle reader my first one wa not back lite i love that i can read outside in the sunshine or in bed with no light on it is a great item if you like to read i have not bought an actual book in year
bought our fire on black friday for and bought a gb sd card for it for now we have a gb kindle fire for you cant beat that we have not had any issue with it at all
initially i figured this would be just a fun toy so i resisted buying one for a long time i finally gave in and kept my receipt in the event i needed to return it i absolutely love it and even purchased the echo dot it is a great way to tie all your smart home product together and to simply ask for something to happen there are plenty of youtube video of unique way to use alexa i use wink not too happy with it but with alexa those product work very well the speaker is excellent when you pair it to your phone to listen to music alexa is not perfect and she doe not always understand what you are saying but it is improving
i love this little speaker i can just voice activate an alarm time or ask alexa the weather for the day it is amazing
using to have playstation vue work great and can be used for other service
this is the best way to go if your sick of cable bill movie galore on this
she love it and u it easy to adjust type size she is mputer illiterate and need help loading book
this is not a high performance tablet but i didnexpect it to be for the price it is perfect for playing app game reading and web browsing the biggest downfall is the limitation on customizing the home screen
very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selection online it sound very good for it is size
this item wa for the kid for christmas the amazon freetime feature with multiple child user profile is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time
serf it is purpose pretty neat feature i like it
our year old grandson love asking alexa to sing song that he learns in pre school
alexa work great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and bose sound link mini set up
checking e mail is a breeze all the apps you uld ever want i do not need my mputer anymore
my echo is such a helpful assistant she turn the light on and off tell me the weather play my favorite music find recipe wake me when i set an alarm and help me relax and sleep with meditation music i have one in the living room and a a dot in the bedroom
this is an easy to use box voice ntrol is a nice bonus
this is a wonderful device especially for the beginner my year old mother step by step setup instruction are easy to follow and the price is phenomenal for the feature it ha
my mom love it she doe not even use her chromebook anymore i love my new chromebook shhhhhh
i needed something to ntrol my home alarm and smart gadget easily and this definitely vers it
i bought these for my niece and nephew for christmas they love them they know how to turn them on and locate an app i love being able to set time limit so they are not on their tablet very often great investment
once i figure out all the option i will be able to save money on my cable bill it offer many channel and movie plus you are able to sign up for subscription channel a well the downside is that it is only on one tv or maybe i just have not read enough yet
the new voyage is so much better they have made some major improvement i love that you can swipe or use the side ntrols the writing is crystal clear the batter life last forever i remmend this to anyone
this is an awesome tablet fast great hd display and ha all the apps i need for personal entertainment if you look for a great tablet for entertainment surfing the net or reading your e mail this is the best you can have i also purchased a gb sandisk ultra plus memory card i strongly remmend it not for work but itâ is great for entertainment
a nice size with many perk like a crisp screen fun vibrant lored outer shell however the pop up ad are annoying
great for kid bought both lors for two of my kid
amazon echo is a great product give you information news music restaurant turn on appliance light and more highly remmended for the techie in your family
the echo wa an excellent addition to our home we like asking alexa thing and playing music
i love this tablet it ha great quality and function just like an apple tablet yet you save hundred i love how it also connects to alexa dot apple doe not have that
this is a good tablet kid are happy and so am i got my stuff back now that kid have their own
well worth the money it doe everything it say it will do and more
my son love his tablet easy access to the internet and download game
for the st of the tablet i am very pleased it is much easier to use this for kindle v reading off of my phone
bought this to replace my samsung galaxy tab that wa about year old and seemed to be running slow and wa a bit heavy for a inch tablet this is much lighter and since i will probably use it mostly to read book and play game like candy crush it is fast and easy to use very happy with it so far
this is an upgrade for my wife a her old kindle would not charge anymore she like the feel and the game plus reading material it rolled over most of her game easily tried to get her to buy an ipad but she ha all she need on thus device
this adapter help free up mputer port so that charging my kindle is not in my way
wa expecting the moon but very happy with what it actually is limit are being pushed by active development so it is a new experience every week or so nice interaction with home automation amazon prime is not bad either
good product and excited to use it bought some for our kid
a bit dissapointed in local station reception fire tv is not what wa expected ok but just not a expected
note the information on the best buy site is wrong this is not a g device but rather a g device it really make no difference but just for clarity let get it right very light and small e reader with a very good display and the squeeze functionality for page turning is a nice addition not a revolutionary device but evolutionary
wa undecided between new paperwhite and voyage model and doing a lot of research to see which one is best based on some personal analysis on in store sample i felt the voyage ha nothing more price worthy than what new pw uld offer with lesser if you are undecided like me do not worry about the gimmick of voyage go for pw
camera a little lower quality and cpu speed a little slower than fire hd but a good price
it is useful and quite light weight this tablet is much more than my expectation besides my eye feel very mfortable to read article on it
we ask alexa question all day recently i received a gift of amazon prime now i have alexa read my free book while i work around the house my husband asks weather and ballgame sres
the quality is great with an affordable price my kid love this product
this item tie in perfectly with my new alarm system with camera is and thermostat ntrol
my mother kindle paper finally died so i bought her this she love it because she can do so much more than just read book on it great product
of you re looking for a tablet with all the bell and whistle this may not be for you if your looking for a great reader with easy access to all amazon ha to offer at an affordable price this may be what you re looking for
nice it all ready ha amazon and apps built in great buy
i love the amazon echo it is everything i expected and more
good product at low price and very good image resolution
this is actually really ol great for party surprisingly amazon wa out of stock but best buy came through
a fun speaker not a nice a siri however it will do
purchased this a a gift for outdoor reading in the sun etc it work quite well and wa proved reasonably
a real nice tablet for child and got it on sale at bestbuy
easy to set up and fun for all age helpful info
i set up the fire and alexa automatically downloaded and that wa good unexpected i use it daily for news sport and some business research the home screen is a little much at time and i thought it would be fine but i think i would like gig instead of but i can just pop in extra memory
this is a great small tablet i love that you can increase the storage memory it is easy to use and it is light not heavy like some tablet
i still like holding a book and reading but for traveling dr appointment much easier than carry a big fat paperback have stopped using my tablet for reading this is easier on the eye book download in a send i always have several book ready so a soon a i finish one book i can start a new one hard to do with a paperback
i wa happy with the product i uld not pa up on the price and also it run very nicely
great price work well for what i needed no need to spend hundred on other tablet
i bought this for my year old it perfect for playing not to heavy game and for reading the only down side is that not apps are available in the amazon app store others than that not bad at all also side loading the no available apps do not work all the time if your looking for something to surf the net and watch movie on then this little table is perfect for you
great e reader preffered the brighter display of the voyage over the paperwhite happy with g connection for all time access
this is a fun and nvenient toy but i m surprised about some of the limitation i keep hearing the same npr news clip when i ask for news or headline news i would like more news highlight when i ask for is music echo start with the same of song each time
a time go on i learn more way to use the echo
i really like this new toy have not mpletely got it all set up to everything but so far it ha been a lot of fun playing with it and getting it set up
amazon tv is a great streaming devise and it ha voice ntrol the fire tv also stream in k
great fun i wish it wa wireless i understand the tap is wireless but why would not everything be wireless
echo work flawlessly it voice regnition to respond to request is great just purchased a send one for the upstairs
absolutely love the tablet my wife love it much more enjoyable than playing on the phone
solid unit for reading and the occasional tv show or game those ming from a full featured tablet may find themselves frustrated at some of the limitation and quirk of amazon is walled garden but if your are looking for something cheap they doe what it say on the box you cannot go wrong
needed a tv in our kitchen wa not looking for huge or fancy for this so the inch wa perfect for u
i wa looking to purchase the fire tv stick or the fire tv i got the fire tv on black friday my friend purchased the fire tv stick and i wa impressed with the capability it provided when i saw the fire tv on sale i decided to give it a try and i wa really impressed with the speed with just going through the menu and the apps i would definitely remmend this product who is looking for a medium player there is a lot of app option to get
my son already had one just upgraded but he love it
i am very happy with this purchase keep my grandson entertained easy to set up and use
fun sometimes difficult in phrasing my question fr alexa i love it but still having difficulty finding the ap to enable different thing n love the music and sound is good
this is one of the best toy i have everyone enjoys how easy it is to get information news music and more the sound is great even outside the only reason i did not give a rating of is that the echo ha to be plugged in to operate i wrongly assumed it wa portable however i wa able to purchase a battery that hook on to the bottom and now my echo is portable
great alternative to cable easy to use and set up
this is the best tablet i have ever purchased the screen is amazing and very functional and the kid mode is easy to get to and my year old love it make me jealous and want to get a kindle but that is ok i can use parent most while he is sleeping all over a really good tablet for both parent and child
very useful product i like very much perfect side very easy to navigate into
i bought this a a gift and we all tried it out setup wa pretty easy download the app connect it to your wi fi and you re off and running from there some of the potentially useful thing that we saw right off the bat were reading your news headline in the morning it feel like a voice oriented google search getting answer to random question kid are easily entertained by itpersonally i do not see the need for it but i can appreciate the nvenience and novelty of it
a my grandparent love to watch japanese tv live stream local japanese channel and they do not have a smarttv they were paying near mo to watch chnls through the local provider timewarner however i realized they only watch out of the chnls since they only show certain show and news i found fujitv live through many search and i wa able to download the apk onto the firetv via kodi through fujitv i subscribed a month subscription for le than and my grandparent are able to watch channel with day playback and full program list for all channel with the ease of using the firetv remote the interface of the amazon fire tv is simple and easy to use a for the quality of connection picture and durability they were all up to par and doe what we want it to do and more whenever my grandparent are not watching their japanese show i use it to stream the movie show via hulu
loved the box doe exactly what is supposed to do stream movie all day long
amazon echo aka alexa might be the best ai standalone device on the market yes i know google home is available now because she connects to over of my apps a she ha hundred of apps connected google home is ol but alexa is the og lol
i am upgrading from a gen i love that i can add a mini sd for more storage also a lot easier to navigate my son now ha my old one for reading book
easy to set up had all the channel i felt it wa le clunky than roku
i got this only because the next best full android tv is the nvidia shield which is a little out of my price range amazon block alot of the native android feature and hide some apps that are generally available in the android play store other than that it is a great streaming device
we canceled cable and love our firebox it save u about a month
i brought this for my wife for valentine is day she love it she can now read at night in bed with the light out
good for toddlerseasy to carryeasy to download
it is a good product but doe not work well for some case for example user with different noise environment and different accent some time the searched result are funny also hope it support other language also price too high
i really liked the idea of this tablet being affordable for my niece and having a protective case wa a plus but after setting this up and giving it to her it work like a dream great way to give a kid something both fun and educational
it is easy for my senior citizen parent to use got for her a a gift
love this thing carry alexa from room to room wa a little tricky setting her up but i have teen who figured it out have not had it that long and there is plenty of thing you can use it for like calender and shopping list the more you use it the more it doe it is a learning process but so glad i got it
work great just like the review said thinking about another one
good producti would tell a friend and family to buy
i initially bought the tablet for school i use kindle to rent book but after using it to stream xfinity netflix and amazon prime i loved the sound and picture quality i would remmend this to anyone needing a good low st tablet with great battery life
great device work well i m impressed with some of it ability
i would remmend this prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a npack

this paperwhite work well it is easy to use i would remmend it is lighter than the fire i wa using to read book on
i wa satisfied with tablet and size and clarity
this ha kept my kid entertained but maybe just a little too entertained sadly they do not want to do much else
i have the st gen fire and love it so i purchased this for my grandson a i know it is quality and durability he love it and with the kid friendly underground free apps make it all the more great the camera not so much overall great tablet for the price
i purchased an asus in i love it it wa so much easier to switch all my document and load program from my other pc the only problem i had wa the facial regnition it kept saying it did not regnize me and got locked up customer service wa very nice and got me going again
purchased this to use during my travel so that i m not nfined to what is available to me from others i connect to the hot spot on my phone and i am all set
excellent resource for child video streaming by wifi using mobile hotspot with kid
very user friendly long lasting battery very clear display
this is a good starter a the mpany provides more device that it can ntrol it will beme excellent it is very limited at this time
the echo doe everything i love it they add new apps often
the kindle work a it should and wa inexpensive but ha a short battery life
this device is awesome this wa the first box we bought that allowed u to download whatever apps we wanted the first apple tv didnallow that i also love that it is android and therefore much more open than apple amazon ha a decent amount of stuff with prime that add to netflix and hulu if you are into watching show by the season
although my young grandchild love it we are disappointed many of the question we ask alexa she cannot answer they were notobscure question nor mplicated
it wa easy to hook up there is a learning curve a in how to ask it question
work well with alexa ntrolled switch and external system need work on answering arbitrary question that need to be looked up online but over all worth the price of admission
the processor is very slow the tablet is great for reading book and ordering stuff from amazon but it is really slow opening aps pay more to get the better processor
love the amazon echo a great addition to the family
i have previously owned a nook and ipad this ereader is by far the best the instant dictionary is a plus excellent for reading in bright or low light nditions easy out of the box set up no mplaints
echo is amazing still learning more thing great product
i thought it would have more skill but overall it work in progress
we both really enjoy our echo there wa no problem setting it up i literally just plugged it in and have not touched it since besides enjoying the music we really like the shopping list the weather function is great also a far a it is sound it ha a little too much bass for me that is the only reason i didngive it star
my friend love it it is what he need for his holiday
i had to replace my last kindle so i made a quick run to best buy got a great deal and purchased the replacement insurance kindle work fine it is slow and need to be restarted frequently pretty much the same a the last kindle
got this to replace my old g kindle with keyboard and it is great that i do not have to use a outside light to read after dark good job amazon
didnalready said great minimum fifty character
i bought two of these a a birthday gift for my niece and nephew they absolutely love them they use it all the time to play game and music great deal great price love itl
do not know why i did not think about getting one of these earlier this is one we just leave around for anyone to use a the price is so great and most of u use it for internet and playing have not gotten the chance to read a book on it yet but hoping that will change in the new year
i bought this tablet for my mom for christmas and she love it

great for game and reading price wa great great battery life well worth the money
it get the job done and i like it it is really good for little kid a well
this wa a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough i had to buy a wireless speaker for it
we wanted something you uld read book on and watch show through amazon and hulu this meet those need and then some
the kindle is great for reading at night and is very mfortable
play almost all the song i have requested from pandora some song were only available from amazon
item is a replacement for one that wa starting to go back it work fine
decent tablet for the price my kid love them
limited activity for my son to surf the web and do the thing he like to do
work like a charm just what i wa looking for
bought it a a gift for someone that work at home they love it very easy to setup make it easy for someone to listen to music if you have an online service pandora spotify etc with out having to setup a bluetooth connection to an external speaker this make it a joy for this person and she love it lot of thing you can do besides listen to music set timer ask question sport sres weather endless feature and function worth the money
when i just want to read the kindle paperwhite is everything i need it doe not strain my eye so i can read longer if i want the front lit screen is perfect in dim light it is small so i cannotake it with me easily i send document to it regularly and i prefer reading it than anything else
this is a good tablet for your everyday used
my son love his kindle it wa relatively inexpensive and he ha dropped it multiple time and not a scratch
brought this for my yr old son he cannot put it down would remmend this product
would give it a star if the battery lasted a long a they claim but it is worth the extra charging time for the nice design so light and easy in your hand especially without the ver but using the ver is mfortable a well the leather ver smell a bit when it arrives but i let it air out for a few day before using it and now it is fine nice quality leather and i love the merlot lor the page turn button are easier to use than the button on the voyage screen look the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one i m very happy with my oasis
i bought the amazon stick and box due to many people telling me how great it wa well i have had no better experience than getting this and watching a many movie and tv show a i want for free just upgrade your wireless internet package and you will love it
an acceptable e reader you will need to spend to remove the ad
what a deal i got this black friday specially for a kid who love reading
i got this tablet for skype call and browsing it is good if you do not have an ample spe of task
i like the bigger screen size it allows me to read my book without straining my eye and allows more of the text to be displayed

great for streaming music getting weather or news flash and we always enjoy trying to answer the extra jeopardy question from each category every night
very good price good item would purchase again this wa a gift
since purchasing this product i rarely ever watch live tv anymore it doe exactly what i wanted it to
great for reading internet and game playing small enough to easily carry it in my purse definitely remmend
glad to get the geek squad back the tablet is great best gift i uld have gotten
the only bad thing about alexa is you have to down load apps for her to do thing she is getting smarter by the day a long a i put the apps in but she is fun
i am not really a fan of tablet but when this one came out it had my attention i bought it a a gift to surprise my husband with and he absolutely love it love the fact that you can set the background and it is not a hard to operate like the older kindles
absolutely make my home feel more updated i use her to ntrol all of my light and tv s
great device that ha a long battery life get lot of use
easy set up easy to use highly remmend to anyone
the amazon warranty of this product is great for a reason it need to be because they have to keep replacing it i had two that died within week and every single one ha broken the screen
the thing you can ask her are unlimited a long a you download the program you want into the echo app but there are so many too go through not sure what is good and what is not
the amazon fire i bought for christmas work great
i purchased these for my and year old daughter they love them the memory is quite low a they have to delete apps when it get full but overall good value
the device itself is funtional and give you access to many type of service ex netflix hulu amazon prime and much more it also allows you to customize it by side loading program it not a bad little device but i prefer it big brother the amazon fire tv
bought this after reading and watching a number of review it wa a mother is day gift for my wife she love it she get to tell it what to do and it listens highly remmended
bought for my kid they love it work well
i rate of for price paid v product quality
we had purchased this for our daughter the parental ntrol profile feature are great for her totally remmend
the fire tablet ha an amazing screen great price sim card slot
this is a great tablet just the right size i wish the rd wa longer but it wa still really good it stay charged for the right amount of time
best present to me it go everywhere that i go
i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason wa for a decent bt speaker for my office this ha great sound streaming my prime music and xm vi the xm app cannot go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word is she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out
great for the price you can not beat this kindle fire l
picture quality is not good i do not like this product
i love being able to use voice activation for anything from playing music to making an amazon purchase
with a off deal last blackfriday who will not get it much clearer and faster than the other fire hd light weight too
this is my send kindle i think this product is good for all age it is durable
i bought one now my sister ha one my mom and three more family member easy to use and set up i keep finding more u for it it is the center of my automated home and a good bluetooth speaker alarm clock and news reader
my son bought this with his own money during black friday it wa his th kindle fire definitely an upgrade from his previous generation model i love the durability and extended ability to accept a larger sd card screen is notably better he travel with me on work trip and having an amazon prime and netflix acunt for this thing make it the perfect travel mpanion
picture quality is not the best mpared to pricer tablet this tablet is great for only if you watch a lot of vids i suggest getting the hd version a the picture audio is better
the kindle is easy to use ha a bright back light and travel nveniently in a at pocket
bought one to replace the smaller non hd version lot faster and picture is noticeably better would remmend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra or so on the big name
a tablet for under what a good deal thanks amazon
this product is a basic tablet that get the job done i wa not looking for an established brand name tablet just something basic for a few apps i use and surfing the web and this tablet wa well within my budget
would recmend bought one for my daughter prefer over my expensive larger tablet
alexa ha a lot of app usage the speaker work fine for playing music but i would not pay full price for it i bought on sale and i am happy enough to keep it but i still like my google home better
this kindle rock ton of storage at an awesome price
my first kindle paperwhite lasted several year and i used it a lot when it quit i immediately went to best buy and purchased another one after only about five week my new kindle stopped working i uld no longer turn the page again just like my old one i went back to best buy and they exchanged it for a new one if it had been just about another week they would not have exchanged it i thought the kindle wa a great product but wa disappointed that it had quit again this time i bought the insurance plan best buy treated me great there wa never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund even though i did not have my original receipt only had my charge card bill there wa not a problem
the amazon echo is everything that is advertised smart intuitive and ha a plethora of information and feature at her metaphorical fingertip i definitely remmend this for anyone a it make life a whole lot easier
amazon echo is a great speaker if you love techy thing it tell you the weather and whatever else you would like to do
i had the small echo dot this wa an addition the speaker is so much better then the dot i wa able to connect them together so i can hear my music in both room love the amazon echo great purchase
this is a great tablet for the price currently using it for year old love the parent timer and setting only negative is with no physical button going back or home is little harder than other tablet it is not the fastest tablet either but work well if you use it for very basic need
fern michael book hideaway wa not sent to my reader
this tablet is awesome and for an awesome price it replaced my laptop so much more nvenient and easier to carry
staff urteous and knowledgeable would remmend store any time awesome sale
it wa mainly purchased for reading in dark it doe not irritate eye when used in night without light
my grandson love it play it all time love the app store
doe everything i need in a box tie it in with amazon prime and it all you need
the kindle over all is great there is only one thing i would want better and that is the speaker my last kindle wa louder i really miss the louder speaker
in a field full of option the fire kid edition really me among one of the top ntenders great parental ntrols and great array of downloadable ntent make this a great stepping stone into the world of tablet for kid i see review that list battery life a a n but at over six hr and for the price what more do you need i m buying this for my four year old and i m not planning on her being on the tablet for six hour let alone or which is what bigger tablet can handle if you have older kid perhaps you may want to nsider a bigger more powerful tablet for the pre school crowd this is just a great tablet for both learning and entertaining
we have echo is one in the living room and the other upstairs alexa will not only play whatever music you ask her to but she will tell you the weather a joke is a timer an alarm clock keep a grocery list will notify someone of your choosing of an emergency at home is a mpanion for an elderly person or even keep a paraplegic mpany just by using their voice there are hundred of apps that you can download that enables alexa to do on your mmand we use the echo everyday and have listened to our favorite song from our past a well a current hit and or radio station she ha beme a welme addition to our home buy one you wonregret it
i purchased the and unit at the same time they are both nice little tablet for using the amazon apps and cruzing the internet but the is lacking the additional mb of ram an gb of storage that make the worth the additional money
great price and work great for book reading would remmend
very basic if you need more than the basic look for an android tablet
this tablet ha been a great learning tool for my child
speed is great backlight is great the screen is not reflective great
great product and work a described easy to learn
the price wa right for what i needed and it dose what i need it to do
i am totally happy with this product for my two year old grandson he enjoys it when we are all playing on our phone
lightweight easy read easy page turning self adjusting read light great too
if you want to cut the cable rd this the product needed
this is a great tablet for kid i like the fact that it is not expensive in case it is lost or broken i bought a send tablet for my son and it work great
great table in factam typing this review with it now
i love my kindle fire i downloaded book easy thank god for that
i bought this for my husband and he love using it
i bought this tablet for my daughter and she love it so i love it
work great a i would expect it too only mplaint why is this not just part of the kindle purchase instead of a separate line item
would like to be able to delete item to make room for more thing i do want but otherwise i enjoy it very much easy to take anywhere
best tablet for the money and then some load fast good quality graphic too
the kindle ha done everything that wa in the review and great price very easy to use
we love this tablet for our year old she can operate it on her own and it ha a great variety of educational and learning game for her we love that it ha skype capability but the volume for skype is very quiet overall great tablet for a first tablet for kid
purchase the box so i can save money because i tired of paying time warner best decision i made
i loved that the kid enjoyed it and i would be getting another one
so far this tablet ha been efficient it kinda bad is difficult to use and it seems to require a lot of step to get the kid profile set up and it actually doe not do everything i hoped it would
you cannot beat this for the price the internet is fast and a good reader

with the ver attached the battery last for a good long period with the ver detached which is how i use it primarily the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand the ability to switch hand flip upside down mean one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and it fit into my pant pocket again perfect for traveling the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several day but i tend to rennect the ver at night i am assuming that help to recharge the basic oasis battery regardless it wa well worth replacing our older kindle reader with the newer oasis we bought two
it wa what i needed all this time and i really remmend it for anyone
i got this a a present for my wife she really like it she u it to check out the weather before going out it is able to tell her what her fit bit unt is without her having to open her laptop or her phone app we can have it play pandora or i heart radio and it keep track of our shopping list

i currently own kindles including this one so i am very familiar with the kindle fire tablet i love that this new fire ha updated the look and feel i can add a memory card to download book movie photo and game on so i cannotake them with me when i m on the go and do not picture which i love so for it is a great value there are only thing that i wish this kindle had there is no sleep wake function and it doe not have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my tv but again for the price it is a great product

tablet work great nice big size good battery power no problem using it
kid love their kindles amazon freetime allows them access to ton of age appropriate ntent they love the game apps and video available to them based on their age the only reason i give this star is due to the charging connector they are not kid friendly and the kid bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their device on their own otherwise kindle kid is amazing
i had bought a k tv and wanted to view some k ntent so got this i found some k demo on youtube and i wa amazed at how good the picture quality wa in addition to watching prime video i also watch slingtv which seemed to work fine during the little time i used it setup wa simple and it wa up and running in no time
i would like this product a lot more if it came with a remote ntrol that is not a small a the original
seems ok but not what i really needed i m not much of a reader
a nice tablet for the price no a lot of meaningful mpetition at this price range which make the fire tablet an easy selection for the price nscious buyer
if i uld give it a lower rating i would this is nothing more than a speaker and a big one it is not wireless so you cannot even take it outside w o a power source you cannot ask question and have alexa search answer very expensive would like to try google but since i cannot return this i cannot justify the price everyone said give it time to like alexa i gave it too much time and did not realize you had to return within a time frame my bad
enjoying my alexas we have multiple alexa is and dot around the house and garage
the battery doe not last a long a wa advertised if you have the money i would remmend the backlit model

helpful learned a lot gave good information good mparison
this speaker ha some kick the sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out
i got this because i saw it on amazon m i the went to bb just to see if they had it in stock i fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it wa good enough to spend the on if i didnwant it i uld give it to my mom or something this thing ha really impressed me i have an ipad and an iphone is the kindle is not near the performance of those guy but i wa looking to step outside my esystem and just get a feel for something new besides amazon can do no wrong bottom line is that it is a greater starter tablet something to have on the nightstand and let the mpany use

this is awesome welme to the future love that it integrates with a ton of different thing
amazon fire tv is just an amazing addition to your tv even if you have a smart tv the ability to add so many more apps than your smart tv platform provides is great very customizable love it
this is my first tablet and i have had for just a short while so far it seems to be a great product for the price i plan to use it primarily a a reader which will allow me to stop accumulating book in my small apartment so the small form factor seems to fit that purpose and it is a bonus to have a browser and the availability of lot of apps too
able to read book and use apps like netflix feel slow when you are used to using an ipad but obviously there is a big price difference
it wa easy and simple to use fast and responsive
a little mplicated in the beginning when opening the apps but once you get the hang of it then it is easy and fast
my son had a nabi we bought for learning entertainment there were many game we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it but we habe yet to enunter a problem with the fire i download game and book for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet
nothing bad to say about the kindle i knew what i wa getting when i got it and it ha not disappointed
love my kindle i take it with me everywhere i would remmend this to all my friend and family
alexa can do almost everything is nstantly learning that is just the app the echo itself is fantastic speaker when player music it is almost lifelike is seems to be like the star trek shipboard mputer it great for the kid of any age to help with homework it great to take note create shopping list music or question of any kind in fact it sgreat for most anything it is simply awesome
my previous kindle did not have the backlight so i upgraded to the paperwhite in order to be able to read wherever i happened to be
ol device pretty much answer everything take time to pair with other device
bought one for myself several month ago have enjoyed it so much i got one for my mom and one for my dad a a christmas gift they are not tech savvy but found it easy to use are enjoying them very much
the amazon fire tv is a great streaming box i also have the amazon fire tv stick which is just a good the reason i gave the fire tv only star is because i see no reason to even have the fire tv a the fire tv stick is just a good if not better nsidering it size than the box sure with the box you get better performing spec out of it but what for in my performance review the fire tv stick performed on par with the fire tv box the choice is up to you a they are both great streaming device however save yourself some money and go with the fire tv stick
will remmend to friend and family best tablet i bought
having fun exploring the capability the sound quality is great
this is my send echo just purchased for new ndo greatest invention both for music information and ordering also once you attach to voice mmand feature such a light it is amazing

i bought the amazon fire tablet for my year daughter to view learning program and video i love it because you can have up to child and adult sign up and create the parental ntrols level for each of them
i bought a generic one over internet and it sucked so i decided to use this one instead and the performance of this is really awesome and the alexa help a lot to avoid type writing
watching lot of show without any issue easy to setup
great tablet not for the power user average user will find everything they need
i purchased this for my mother in law she wanted the bible put on it i loved it for myself i almost kept it it wa great but i already have an ipad
the speaker sound very decent for the size and st but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable i can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in
i love my kindle voyage it truly is almost like reading a paper book
nice for kid ha parental ntrol for apps and other function
it is a amazing a i expected reading with a kindle is just reading a book
we bought this to replace a roku that had died this is an excellent streaming device it ha roughly the same spec a a roku but is much le expensive i definitely remmend this
it is amazing how quickly alexa ha beme a central mponent to our household
i purchased this tablet for a need family for christmas i know they really enjoyed it
go ahead and spend the extra for the firetv worth every penny spent
overall it is hard to say this is a good tablet just looking at it in a vacuum that being said when you take the price into nsideration it is hard to say it is not a good value the screen is not very bright so outdoor use is difficult i wanted to use it a a screen for my drone but it not ideal and it is locked down by the amazon echo system it doe work and it doesnt hiccup or struggle too much and again for the value especialyl when i bought it for it hard to argue it can also be hacked to install the play store on it which make it even more of a value
this is our send kindle highly remmend pairing with amazon prime getting the kid unlimited package
awesome everything i need and more i m very happy with the tablet i m very happy thank you kathleen stroyek
bought this for my husband he ha really enjoyed it
this unit is very easy to use and me with voice activated remote
i bought it during black friday cause it wa cheap and on sale in the end it wa a really good buy there is a lot you can do add to the tablet yet it ha an external memory jut look into what you can do to this tablet and you ll fall in love
i wa skeptical about this at first once i learned how useful the sres to further expand the capability of my amazon prime membership i wa quite impressed her response are very prompt and accurate i look forward to adding on bill and whistle using alexa turn on and off light in the house or setting the temperature by speaking a mmand
i do not like the fact that every thing is in picture instead of word on my old paper white i had a list of unread book now i have picture i do not read picture if there is a way to make it into a list i have yet to find it i thought the that reading is the point
i bought one of these in december a an inexpensive back up for an ipad i sincerely believe that the fire tablet is the best bargain i have ever had in an electronic device i now gift these to my elderly friend who need a simple internet connector
i got this tablet for my nephew and have downloaded a lot of educational apps from the amazon store
it wa simply to set up and easy to use plug in sign in and bam
it is alright to browse the internet and watch video
bought this tablet a a gift and my brother really enjoys it
my daughter loved it nd i love that she leaf my phone alone now
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire while the fire is an amazing deal for serious readin g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eye and ha superior resolution now it lack many of the feature of the le expensive fire such a lor and online with wifi a a reader it is well organized and a pleasure truthfully it is not a whole lot better than the paperwhite it ha a feature or two but i m not sure it is worth the extra dollar it is still an excellent device
great product work perfect get to watch a lot of show and movie
i highly remmend this tablet awesome purchase this is a great gift
this is my rd kindle e reader and it is the best yet text is clear and device is light nsidered the newer voyage and oasis but i believe this is a better deal it wa worth the upgrade from the prior paperwhite
love this tablet it doe everything i need it to my problem is i have family that fall in love with it so i give mine away if this wa not good i would not be on my rd one the only thing i would change is the silly ad and even worse browser other than that a solid product
the paperwhite is a great reader nice to read in the sun nice to read indoors very happy
i like the tablet the only negative is that google apps do not work but for the money i do not really care that much i mostly just use it to read
we love the shopping list feature the timer is great too we feel spoiled
i had a fire stick that i wa having issue with connectivity i didnreally want to spend the extra money but i m so glad i did this thing is fast and the remote work like a champ
i wa looking to bu an affordable tablet but with all the necessary feature and this tablet is great good touch display and speed very happy to buy this but would have been happier if i would have got some disunt
we purchased on of these tablet for the family during a black friday sale my year old son love to play game on it and watch video at home and on long car ride my wife love it to read book we ended up buying a nd one because the use of the first wa so much we love it and cant beat the price
i liked it so much i will e getting all my grandkids one for birthday from now on
great product worth the money to pickup one of these model
i wa not expecting this product to perform so well sleek design mpact and easy installation make this product well worth the money the only thing i wa a little turned off by is that you cannot fully customize the wake name yet and you cannot connect it via bluetooth to a soundbar extra speaker the overall performance of the sound that me out of it is surprisingly great though i just wanted more i got over not being able to add more speaker pretty easily though it is that good i might suggest however adding a harmony home hub with it so you can really take advantage of the voice feature it wa my understanding that the echo can pair with the hub so you can ntrol more item i m going to set that up today so it is not verified just yet
we love our little nsc plant she is very helpful and i know she is excellent at keeping the proper authority informed with the happening in our humble abode
my husband love the fire stick it give all the old movie he love and he can do amazing thing with the sound a the fire stick allows many adjustment streaming is faster too

the amazon fire tv is a great choice voice operated system via remote with capability to download specific apps delegated to fire along with all the android apps that are available on google play easily sideloaded sideloading is simple with the apps fire app your phone sends your application directly to the fire tv wirelessly a detailed this is an all around excellent movie tv music game system at the very least
i got this fire for my friend who want to buy kindle this serf both kindle and tab very nice and very cheap worth for what i paid i highly remmend this for beginner
bought it a a gift for my daughter a an ipad replacement reading without distraction is priceless connectivity with local public library make kindle more valuable
i like this reader it is very easy to load book onto it even from my local library it is easy to adjust the font and size it keep track of your place in the book you can choose what language you want the dictionary in which make it great to read something in a foreign language you can set it up so that when you select a word it will give you the translation
excellent value great product it ha a really solid feel i am very happy with the purchase
my bos remmended getting a fire because she had one and so i got one too and i love that i can read my book from my kindle app on a bigger screen than my phone

we gave this to our son and his family it fit right into their small patio and they are happy that our year old granddaughter can play around it it ha endured heat water bubble splash pool and her knocking it over
this is great my daughter first tablet and it came with everything she needed to get started she love the pink bumper guard and so do i for the safety
there is no problem charging my kindle on the imac however when i travel i need a charger it work perfectly
the amazon tap is the first step into making your home a smart home it will act a a brain to everything else unfortunately you ll have to invest quite a bit more for smart light thermostat lock etc to get the full potential out of it alone it merely act a a bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone
this is great for an yr old she had out grown her nabi and like taking picture this doe just the trick the memory can be extended to hold more picture great tablet
much easier to see game than iphone and to read
this is pretty ol it ha a good variety of option to work with and game which is even better haha
definitely worth the would remmend to friend
tv look good in my room so i kind see video thats good for me
wonderful tab great for beginner or advanced user i sugg st a memory chip
alexa is an excellent product my family u a number of option that are available through it the sound quality is extremely good and it stay on all of the time so glad we have alexa
easy my kid love it easy set up easy to use
this is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectation and you should definitely pay the extra for a total of and get the gb tablet is it the fastest tablet out there definitely not doe it quickly do all sort of business spreadsheet application etc no doe it do everything that an i pad etc can do no but at this price point it cannot be beat people say that you cannot download chrome and the google playstore they are wrong i have both on this tablet and my other fire without rooting them and with the ability to add a gb card it is a no brainer if you want to play game watch movie tv surf the net email etc i know there are a lot of people who dislike amazon and their product but i am obviously not one of them
purchased this to replace my atv to allow use of playstation vue a a huge apple user i expected it to be a sacrifice but i love this even more than my atv
i do like the kindle for reading at the beach and it is very portable
a lot of fun it is great i can wait to try all the feature of it on my home i m going to get the light
if you already have the amazon echo system then the tap is a nice addition i use it primarily a an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice there are bluetooth speaker on the market with better sound quality but it doe an adequate job a a speaker the real advantage is being able to interface with the echo system a well a item to music news etc i have not used it off it is charger long enough to mment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside wa no problem
great tablet for kid and adult great for price
i am satisfied of this kindle upgrade mainly in resolution
we were looking for an affordable quality tablet and this did the trick we are fire fan
christmas present for our girl they work really well
i have been enjoying my echo for about a month i enjoy using it for pandora flash update and general thing like weather and information through wikipedia there is room for improvement in service but that is being addressed with new skill being added generally i like it
easy to order item from amazon right from your tablet
it is incredible so fun keep me entertained keep my year old happy in parent mode
great tool for you and your family to be entertained
i love this tablet i will buy a bigger one next i m tired of cumbersome laptop and this go anywhere use my phone a hot spot i have window phone and my fire is android too heck with the galaxy phone lol with a galaxy lol
alexa is the future if you get a harmony elite remote you can ntrol your tv by voice you can also ntrol your hue bulb what a great toy
it is awesome to be able to address alexa and ask her to do thing like play a song or turn on the light while my hand are wet or i am busy
still learning to use it i wish it wa mpatible with sirius xm radio there are so many skill to enable
best investment made i use this daily for reading and doing light work
for the price this amazon is amazing just like the echo but smaller i show everyone how great it is
wa not sure what to expect a im generally not too savvy with technology this amazon echo product is fairly easy to get started using and can be really helpful when you are multi tasking i normally do not have a free hand and when you cant have your tablet with you at all time the amazon echo fill that void quickly i would suggest everyone with the internet to have one of these in their home
love this new addition the light feature really help
enjoying it not so easy to setup but once you get it all is good
amazon fire tv is amazing lot of free channel and old and new movie you can even watch netflix for free we will be ditching satellite dish and saving per month in addition we will be adding amazon fire stick to other tv is through out our home product is very easy to use
work well but you must enable a lot of skill and then remember the right way to ask alexa a question
paper white doe not allow you do use book from the library a you cannot load apps only book from amazon are available to read
i left my old kindle on an airplane and had to purchase a new one this one is much easier to use the ntrols are more intuitive and loading book from my library in the cloud is so easy now
all the best that the last fire tv wa but now it is k ready and you have alexa to help guide and open apps my mom loved her gift
i bought this for my daughter and my nephew they both loved it it is lightweight inexpensive and very easy to use and set up the one drawn back you need be on wifi
this is a solid tablet that doe everything you would want from a portable device to do
the fire is very much so a it is slogan suggests a sensible tablet inexpensive and versatile highly remmend
we bought two kindle paperwhites and we just love them i love the size and portability of them one of them wa for our kid so that when we travel we do not have to bring a bunch of book in the car it is all on one little device and free up so much space in the car
child love it can be used for more than just a time killer can learn from it
a great kindle reader easy to order read and store book also speedy for finding amazon product and ordering them but the other apps are really slow too slow
it a great all around tablet with all the extra feature you need if your an avid reader
the best e reader it is light weight and hold it charge for day awesome
i got a great price for the kindle love the lor option great for game watching tv show movie on netflix hulu and reading book perfect for car ride waiting room
i wa impressed with the overall of this kindle it ha so many nice feature and easy access
once you can figure out all the apps you can connect to the echo for entertainment you ll be set but it wouldnt just play a song if you asked alexa to play a song she would say something like it is not in your playlist you need to update your amazon acct or something to that extent but very entertaining
my kid love their new tablet they use them for homework and at school
worth it to spend the extra dollar and get the box w game ntrol
i bought this device because my fire hdx wa not adequate for reading in direct sunlight for sunlight reading i give the paperwhite a however i cannot change the display time before the screen sleep the reading location jump backward and forward a lot when i touch the screen when i thought i wa just going one page either way the home screen is nfusing and not user friendly only book visible on show special model and the battery only last one day if i read or hour for those reason i give it a for both design option and user friendliness that is a averaged up and gave it star
this is on of the best medium player on the market i have cromecast and roku and this is the top
best reader ever i have had a lot of reader like paper white kindle dx b n nook and kobo aura hd before i get kindle voyage but this one is really different the only feature that i wish it d support is memory slot i guess amazon will add it to the next generation of kindles a well a kindle fire
great reading experience always easy on the eye
purchased the amazon fire tv when it went on sale for buck and i am very happy with this purchase this will surely replace cable tv in the not so distant future
not needed but nvient to use for music and question kid enjoy giving her order
user friendly and give me access to all my streaming service
i love how easy and fun amazon echo ha made my home learning more everyday to really benefit from all it capability
work well for the purpose of reading and a few game
this kindlefire wa exactly what i needed for light weight portable entertainment for my granddaughter on a trip i uld access all of the audio book game and reading material from the audible app and kindle app on my ipad onto this small device that slipped easily into my purse it wa easy to use on the airplane a well a in line at disneyworld without taking up much space or being heavy
i went back and forth but this wa the right call
i purchased this so that i uld use skype to check on my dog during the day i had to download an app that make the fire stay on otherwise it go to sleep once i had that app installed and skype doing the auto answer it worked well overall if i wa going to use this a a reader or mini tablet it look like a good product the screen is bright and sharp
this tablet is just the right size for travel and the kid it ha the amazon app store and user interface and lot ofgreat feature auto uploads picture and video to your amazon cloud
a decent machine for the black friday price of under the gb of memory is inadequate if you play game using the apps i added a gb micro sd card but not all the apps use it and the one that do only transfer part of the application to it all point in etc earned are retained in internal memory not sd card picture video music can be stored on sd card screen is very sharp
great streaming and very smooth i have not had it lagging yet
it is agood tablet for beginner kid and great for the price
love my kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it
it wa on sale worth it for a first time tablet buyer for something inexpensive
this is a great table for browsing the net reading or listening to music however when moving to video apps like youtube crunchyroll to name a few the video will either not play or the app wonshow on the home screen you have to do with video provided by bing
this fun device ha changed our viewing habit the diversity is great
the new tablet is great nice upgradeslove how easy it is to use easy to get apps shop and browse the web
fast enough to play video and movie also esay to install
i purchased three of these one a an upgrade to my old kindle and two for xmas gift the battery life seems short but otherwise i have no issue i used it primarily for reading on the train and browsing the internet
initially i bought the amazon echo to take it for a test drive just to see what all the hype wa about after about a week of playing with the device i bought an amazon echo for my bonus room my living room and my bedroom i am simply amazed at what the amazon echo can do i am a lifetime apple product supporter but this device here is simply the best i have seen so far pair the echo with a smartthings hub then ask alexa and it done
if you re looking for a small but effective tablet that is reasonably priced this tablet is the one for you it is easy to understand the direction therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet it me in different lors and is easy to read and use give it a try thanks best buy
great tablet for age and under my kid love them
use everyday around the house and outside and travel
i love to read and i find by downloading book on my kindle is so easy i love it
this a great product for everyone i would remmend it
i love my kindle paper white and it easy to use w usb charger
i really like the echo alexa i started the digital age in my home little by little but it all started with alexa i still have a long way to go but it ha been a fun journey to take now i can ntrol my light tv door music around my home my year old daughter would speak with alexa and say alexa let it go the frozen song will me up
got this tablet for my kid age to really good starter tablet with excellent parental ntrols on it doe not necessarily have all the bell and whistle but still an excellent tablet especially for the kid
functionality is awesome and it can do a lot of ol stuff the speaker is good in small room
my year old ha one and my year old wanted one so now they both have one the parental ntrols are easy to use and work great i would highly remmend to anyone
the echo is awesome and fun we use it to ntrol tv is thermostat light and stereo all with voice mmands anyone using amazon prime will like the voice ordering we find something new everyday that the echo will do
work a expected upon purchase no issue easy setup
i wa a little skeptical about reading book on this device thinking it would not feel like reading on paper i wa wrong very realistic
perfect for young kid small yet easy to operate
my yo is quite rough with stuff a most are and the case that me with it is great
work great easy to use fast great for the whole family
love my tablet best one so far it is light weight and easy to use
i have had several budget tablet but this blow them all away you have to be willing to be invested in the amazon esystem but it is well worth it
this tablet is certainly large which make it cumbersome when reading in a reclining position however it terrific for reading or watching film on a plane desk or otherwise sitting up
my grandkids wanted this for obvious reason and when i saw it go on sale on bb i jumped at the chance and bought it the kid love it
got this for christmas for my year old and she love it
the functionality is great although i wish it came in more lors
this is exactly what i wa wanting it is perfect for what i want and it hold so many book
it wa not expensive great for the price i m happy
i had this device for few week before returning it and getting the kindle voyage but the only difference between the two is the design page press button and the auto dimming light a they both have the same screen after purchasing this device i immediately devoured three book in the urse of a weekend which sadly is more than i have read in about two year this device ha reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery last for quite a while i would suggest that you get the genuine leather ver for this device when you buy it a it just add that little extra to the purchase overall i would remmend anyone that want to read more read often or read many book at once to take the plunge and buy this device plus new book can be upwards of sometimes this little device will carry all of your book and only sts the price of a few hard py book plus if you need a physical py you can always borrow from the library
the echo is very fun and easy to use my only mplaint is that you need to go and enable a lot of the prompt or skill seems to me it should be able to go right out the box but overall lot is of fun
amazon echo is amazing it work perfectly in my room doe the job done
easy to use memory fill up fast though battery life is decent
kid love it easy for them to use only issue is there is a ton of ad that pop up
bought it accidentally meant to get an inch screen
best amazon app for purchasing think more memory card use gb or more
great for first time tablet but more advanced option available
wife and kid love this thing play music with great sound also you can find out about most any with going to my iphone or ipad very nvenient
very easy to use navigate user friendly interface only n is that it is a bit sluggish for the avid user which wa just improved in the rd generation of the fire stick better processor
i am amazed at this little tablet i had and still have a kindle paper white for year before i dared to try to use it and after using it i wa intrigued by the possibility i joined a public library and began reading book for free when i had trouble downloading some book because they were epub instead of kindle i decided to look into the fire this fire st me amazing i do not use a smart phone and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where i drag my laptop like a hotel or at starbucks this little number allows me a lot of flexibility besides downloading book i can go online i can download music from my amazon prime acunt for free music that i do not want to pay for to get onto my ipod classic i can hook up the fire to my bose speaker and the sound is great i already watched a pb tv show on the fire while waiting to get an oil change done on my car at the dealership i added gig of memory for about thinking that i might build quite a music library on this little machine since the memory is removable if the tablet get deep sixed no problem transferring the music elsewhere i think i have almost figured out how to get the music from the fire onto my mac but maybe it cannot be done i do not know amazon doe not let you download from the prime music library to a mputer they only allow the download to tablet and phone but there must be a way around this i think it is been fun trying to figure it all out on the downside i hate the fact that the screen is not an anti glare screen to begin with but i bought something which i think will solve that problem do not like the fingerprint i m trying to get used to the notion of a touch screen i m old i do not like change so adapting is not that easy but i m working on it and i would say for the money even adding the st of the accessory i purchased that this wa a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity i m having a lot of fun with it the tablet doe subject one to advertising when you open it but i ignore it i ignore all advertising everywhere so it is not hard for me to do it is a well ingrained habit if i were forced to look at and read the advertising however then i would nsider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising but for the money you have to make allowance for mmerce i guess i m an apple person so i felt this would be very hard to figure out but it is pretty intuitive after about hour of making endless mistake lol i said i wa old do not expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot thing is you can figure it out i do not read instruction so maybe if someone were more willing to have thing explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve but i only learn by trial and error have fun buy the thing it is so cheap that if you hate it it is no big loss the screen adjustment for reading are good font size background lor etc i needed to have something that wa easy on the eye this work for me
i recently purchased this product for my grandmother she see the text much better and the operating system is very smooth
great value for what i needed just using it to receive email ordersfrom grub hub for my restaurant
alexa ha me in handy by giving calculation while oking weather report and even settling argument about trivia fact very nice
very user friendly with an easy interfacing ability
easy to use wide variety of function awesome price
work perfectly user friendly and ha voice regnition do not waste money on a roku or nexus player definitely worth the money can do k and even non k much better picture quality
i can only mpare this to the previous kindle and is far superior in all aspect but one the battery the battery is a lot le reliable and i do not mean by use the other way i wa used to left my previous kindle several day without to later me back and use it with a decent amount of battery left in this case i have found this more than once empty
you cannot go wrong either with kindle or with the price very good buy
great tablet for messing around with or just to have
great price on a nice little tablet easy to use
wonderful speaker that is easy to use i have parred it with both my ipad and iphone and it work great with both
best buy ha a good price structure for the kindle staff member were very helpful
perfect first kindle easy to useeasy for kid
this item is one of the best add one known to man you can download almost every app to use on your tv there is always update to make sure it work properly i have never had an issue with the fire stick
gave my dad my kindle two year ago and at xmas time i loved the price and upgrade of camara and sd card
i started with the original kindle loved it but light wa bright on the ver for night reading then got the fire a a gift and love that but read more like on a tablet broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night great light to dim for night reading very light too
we get this after my son broke his samsung tablet and i told wa android operating system but wen the time to set it up came take me a little lounger to make a new acunt password and paretal ntrol for my kid but am happy that finally did it
great for streaming k capable not a good a the nvidia shield but also le then half the price overall and excellent buy for the price
only good for kid and game battery life is good
overall a great tablet for the price able to use this for work and play
perfect for watching netflix surfing web checking email and reading kindle book
awesome voice regnition great buy even if sole use is a a speaker great sound
i adore my echo i wake up in morning get a quick weather sport sres and here in florida i get to listen to my favorite nyc sport radio station i use it to access my music and i recently purchased a audio book for the wife and i am waiting until i give her that audiobook for xmas the i can ask alexa to read it to me i am sure alexa doe so much more i even asked it to nvert to metric for me when i wa oking last week i do not have any smart device in my house so i havent had the opportunity to have alexa do that for me but it is so much fun to use and now instead if reaching for laptop to google something i just ask alexa first
this is an excellent tablet for someone who just need something simple and doe not want to spend a lot of money one of my favorite feature is the fact that there is a memory card slot which mean that you can have virtually endless memory this wa an important feature for me since my ipad doe not allow that
this doe not run android so no google play store amazone apps are moztly the same title but not all are available that you can get through google play bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it if you have an amazon prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet a well
love the ease of using them for our grandson and they enjoyed them for christmas
this doe everything a tablet should do and more the best part is that you get ton of free apps that normally st the camera is really great too battery seems to last longer than normal which is a bonus
we love our echo not sure we use all the feature yet but the shopping list feature is great a is all the different music we can now listen to
it is a good tablet for kid wish it would be a little better with game
work faster then the stick i have both run smooth
alexa is a smart a you program her to be nice sound when linked to music source
i love the amazon fire tv box amazon make great product that are great for anyone
great for kid it durable and let them play game etc so they leave our cell phone alone lol
i read the online review and mpared product same price here a on amazon
it wa good i like it easy and simple to use better than apple ipad
good feature for kid but definitely not enough storage you ll need to get an sd card and set thing to download to that or it will freeze and stop working
light timer grocery is alexa echo is voice service doe it all and more voice regnition is amazing from across the room when music is playing it work built in speaker are very good on a bluetooth speaker level setup is easy with the free app select what skill you want to activate to customize echo to your home skill are alexa is ability is more and more integration into home automation weekly alexa already ntrols select light switch thermostat even integration with some car start car remotely how many mile remain before refueling what uld be easier then using voice mmands that work and simply asking question to get information
the first one i received wa doa the send one ha worked flawlessly
very simple setup within minute i wa using and disvering some fun entertainment i am not an amazon prime member yet but i expect being a member will open even more wonderful entertainment
excellent product very good piece strongly remmend
i have had every version of the kindle since the week it wa introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire i replaced the first one i had in and it wa everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat so i got this one first of all i miss swype why get rid of it sendly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freeze with a bunch of de shimmering in the background and only turning it off and or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turn itself off it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past
it good performance and highly remmended to amazon user
i purchased this a a gift for my granddaughter she is yr old and love it it is easy to use and she can scroll between program without problem
had my first kindle the original for many year when i lost it love my new kindle paperwhite can read in the dark
the paperwhite is everything that i expected and more it replaces my first kindle
i bought this tablet for my grandson in th grade he love it
i have a smart tv but the speed with which the apps work leaf a lot to be desired i bought the amazon fire tv because having amazon prime allows me to watch ton of show and movie for free and the selection of available apps is great the only drawback i noticed is that vudu cannot be installed but i do have that on my smart tv so it is not a big issue the remote of the fire tv work via bluetooth so the box can be hidden away and out of sight which is great overall a very solid streaming box
i bought it a a gift for my grandfather from what i cannotell he really seems to enjoy it
the amazon echo is like having a robot in your home she responds to almost everything and it only took about hour to set up
life up to all the positive mments that i found online i have not enuntered any of the negative issue mentioned in the review
great speaker wish spotify would work without having to upgrade to premium in order to link it still trying to learn all the functional feature so that i can maximize it use
bought this to get rid of cable tv work great very easy to set up and wa able to get this working in no time
both my daughter have had kindle for several year and love it purchased their brother one
nd kindle bought a a gift easy to operate can fit in my purse and eliminates having to carry around multiple traditional book

this tablet is much better than the older tablet it is faster and have a camera great improvement over the older version
i love this tablet it doe pretty much every thing my ipad doe
love my purchase of my amazon fire hd it wa a very good experience
i wa surprised by the quality of the screen and it is no slouch either
the best buy salesman told u you cannotake it anywhere and it will play for hour true if you buy a separate battery
this is a great device with good sound quality alexa is voice regnition is very accurate the biggest problem in my house is fighting over who will talk to her
my daughter love it it very easy to use i got the child proof case also
an amazing interactive fun machine superb sound powerful mike and with internet connection unlimited music

i bought this online and picked it up in store it wa lana very easy process the setup is extremely easy i use kodi on it and it work great i used kodi on a firestick and there is no mparison
i love the new amazon fire tv i have signed up my acunts to it and it make watching movie and tv show a lot easier instead of paying for cable and never watching half the channel you can choose what apps are best for you and save money the only n i have is that it not a smooth a the apple tv but it doe offer more apps
growing up i didnhave electronics but this thing is awesome for kid you can limit usage and break down how much time they can spend doing certain thing great buy
alexa is great for listening to music sound quality is excellent
needed somthing for sister who is always on the go easily fit in her purse and she love it
it would be better if it had an additional out put or uld be wirelessly linked to another device or speaker additionally it would be nice if it uld make call
i bought two when this tablet on sale reinstalled the android open source project and turned the tablet into a smooth running battery efficient tablet without any bloatware very happy with the purchase

one of the best item i have ever purchased the fun never end with the amazon echo
light weight charge last for upto a week and can read pretty much anytime of the day indoor or outdoor very happy to have this e reader
doe what it is supposed to fine for reading or watching video but i wa anticipating it having a swype keyboard my earlier gen kindle ha one and it doe not ended up having to buy a a bluetooth keyboard so i can use it to type note at work
i have one and bought my daughter and mama one it is perfect for game and to down load book
bought it for my kid and they love it so then i bought myself one i rake it every where
have been very happy with it am using this a the ntrol point for wifi enabled lighting system sound system tv ntrols etc
the amazon fire is a good tablet for everyday use
this is a great entry point into the tablet market this wa a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it it is a bit on the smaller side but he wa not sure if he would want a tablet so far he really seems to be enjoying it
i like the size of it and it is easy to operate i didnlike that i had to keep trying to put the same information in more than once to more from one screen to another when putting in my card information i need to have wifi to look at the stuff i downloaded and i do not like that but for the st it is ok
amazon fire tv ha been a great device and is a big improvement over the amazon firestick with fire tv there is no lag in apps and run smoothly and without delay the biggest reason we purchased this wa to begin using playstationvue and it ha worked flawlessly
my daughter love this expandable storage help when we make our twice yearly drive to texas and all the game and apps are definitely age appropriate so i do not have to worry about get getting onto anything she is not supposed to be on
this wa simple to install and allows me to stream all of my favorite program
excellent screen fast response almost a steal for that price
the back light is better for your eye then reading on a tablet or phone and is similar to reading a paperback book but you can read in the dark without needing a book light
this is my first fire kindle i love it it is fast and ha good internet it give me quick access to all my kindle library i found out it is easier to scroll through the page than when using kindle touch
with kindles currently in the home this wa a nice edition for my mother for reading her book i mpared this directly next to the basic kindle and the clarity of the font made it well worth the price difference
work flawlessly interface is much faster than the stick
the fire work better than i expected for a tablet i have to imagine it is the best on the market good battery life fast response and loading time nice display the only problem i have had so far is that i have to restart it if i let it sit for over an hour before it will handle a wifi signal
the fire is not going to thrill you like the ipad or surface but it get the job done if you use amazon video hbo go netflix or any streaming device then it is a no brainer
small light weight bright this is the best kindle yet
this good e reader is a gift for my daughter and she love it
i love what my echo can do i get my news weather and traffic from alexa each morning
good reader to carry along for travel i also bought a protective case from amazon which automatically shut down when closing the case i only charged once during my day travel
this is one of the best purchase i have ever made
this is the nd fire tablet ive purchased the first wa for my daughter an she
what can i say since having the amazon echo alexa at home my family enjoys it my kid do math question with her and animal game reading history etc and then there sthe fun time were we ask her joke play music ask silly question and so on i definitely would remmend her to everyone
this is great starter tablet for tweens and mature adult the only issue i have is the forced ad on the homescreen
overall i like the fire tv the ui uld be a better it uld be better organized and easier to navigate it also push amazon video over other streaming service doe not have a many streaming service a roku
i bought an amazon fire tablet for and it is been able to handle anything i throw at it i even run kodi and other apps on it i have a bluetooth keyboard with word processing app and even an external mouse for it finally it run emulator too love my fire tablet it is the best i ever spent
husband lost first kindle fire right before christmas so santa brought him this one a a replacement he is happy seems to work the same a earlier model
love my echo great sound and feel like i have my own personal assistant

i wake up every morning and get my weather and news before i go to work have not really done any other thing with it yet not sure if it is worth the price
this is a great tablet it keep my kid occupied for hour if i need to
easy to use practical bigger than a phone smaller than an ipadeasy on the eye the only draw back is the touch screen need to be easier one must tap harder to open the apps otherwise very satisfied with this item
good price for great product used reward point to help purchase very knowledgable sale person who uld mpare product
wanted a easy reading for outdoors close this based on review did not need to replace my ipad with the more expensive fire tablet would have given it a star but amazon package them with out a charger adapter
this unit cannotell you past present and some future thing and in an instant too
i have not used a product like this and man i have to tell u it is better than apple product
i use the hd for my personal entertainment system
love the speed and apps offered through the unit had eliminated most of the buffering issue i have had with other streaming stick
i purchased this for my mom a a substitute for her kindle fire when she go to the beach she love it and no glare when using great if you like traditional looking book
i cannot say enough good about this product it ha led is so the screen is backlit and yet the battery still last for week i have had mine for over a month and i still have not had to charge it the capacitive touch screen is perfectly responsive and fast too it make no sense at all to pay so much more for the voyage or oasis when the paperwhite is such a fantastic buy
this is very easy to read and just the right size and weight to carry
good tablet if you are looking for one thet doe not st alot amazon ha a nice app market a well
when paired with amazon music alexa is great it will play any song you cannothink of i havent used it for much else yet
great size easy to use and it ha a sleek look that is attractive
really enjoy being able to use alexa to voice ntrol everything
this is our send echo and a th dot really love echo and now have a dot at the office easy to set up i use it for news briefing calendar and music will be trying some new feature like messaging and fitbit
great functionality user friendly and nice apps
i like this tablet very much good for kid to use and st is low quality of touch screen is excellent my kid can watch youtube cartoon play game perfectly
i love the size and design work great i love that i can change font size
more than you average portable bluetooth speaker can stream from amazon spotify pandora etc a the namesake say give it a tap to ask alexa any question add to your list order something on amazon etc battery life is good and speaker is decent but cannot mpete your ue or jbl
echo is a fun and practical unit play great music and ntrols my light love it
i like the paperwhite it is a good size only drawback is the ad on the lockscreen i cannot see how to get rid of them i like the old display of author better
i like it work great and is so easy to set up and use with mpatible product
hd tablet g on sale for thats dollar le then ever before and alexa included
very good but doe not take all aps unless it is related to amazon i uld not get all the aps i wanted good tablet for reading
very disappointed that my kindle voyage purchased in april failed after just two u went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it woncharge wonreset etc since my best buy receipt say i only have day to return it tried calling amazon support their only solution after over minute on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device unacceptable to replace a le than month old device with a refurbished one but given the poor experience i have had with the voyage i m not even mfortable with a new replacement at this point amazon say they cannot do anything about a refund because i purchased from best buy day seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product stuck with a paperweight
i purchased this tablet for my child for christmas and he absolutely love it he ha also dropped it a few time and it ha not cracked or anything
very good price and very good and nice table with nice pic
st amazon fire i love it best investment for my tv
the amazon fire tv stick is awesome watch all your streaming video with no problem
i run kodi and many other apps on it run great for the price i like the nvidia shield more but this is a third of the price
the tv ha the same functionality a my stick the program choice are excellent
i upgraded to this from a kindle keyboard so it wa huge upgrade hold more book and ha a back light the light is fairly uniform but not so bright that it will bother the person next to you battery last a good long while and it is easy to read in direct sunlight too

this is a great tablet for my yr old and a great price to go with it

this tablet is just the right size for my son is hand easy for him to use
i have enjoyed the new kindle however wa extremely disappointed that it doe not have an hdmi port like the old version did
got this for my year old because of the parental ntrols i heard about so far it is been a decent tablet and ha some nice ntrols but it would be better if the ntrols uld be customized by day and specific apps instead of all apps and by weekday weekend
this product is very good there wa no problem in moving all of my book from my other kindle to this one i like the touch active screen and the lite screen the size make it easier to travel
my grandson love it it is exactly what he needed i m very pleased with it and so is he
you have to pay for every thing any thing you want to do you do not pay for the tempter time and joked you owe your money to amazon a unique toy for the rich what a bargain
doe everything that are claimed the speaker system is wonderful
wa a christmas gift and i ended up returning it because it wa not exactly what i wa looking for
easy to set up fun to use your own digital assistant
i own kindles they are my favorite hand held technology so it wa an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday the case help make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would it is easy to use and she love it

i absolutely love this devise i do wish ti wa more mpatible with more thing but it is still well worth it
great little tablet fast doe a lot but doe not do it all missing google play store and screen is only ok price cannot be beaten
this reader is a great way at a low price to feed your newspaper habit i save per month on just one newspaper
top notch streaming box especially if you are an amazon prime subscriber i like the voice search but wish it extended to other application like netflix
i purchased this a a christmas gift for my mom and she seems to be enjoying it
wa nsidering the hd version but realized the spec were notvery different a good tablet for the price paid
this is my send kindle fire and it is even better than the first
have not used for standard fire tv feature bought to run kodi which it work fine for freeze occasionally needing hard reboot worth the extra over doing kodi on streaming stick which lack memory cpu
bought this a a gift it wa a great buy lightweight great look easy to use great sound i would highly remmend this product
this is a great item to use with kid i like adding memory a needed i love the kindle fire aspect some item can be read by text to speech i think the kid will like the camera their old kindle fire did not have this

excellent picture quality it doe not froze at all
i have been using the amazon fire tv stick getting the box is so much smoother
love this echo well worth the price no mplaints
this thing is a disaster unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life you are in for disappointment they have blocked the google store so good luck downloading most of the game you like youtube owned by google so again cannot download the app you can get there with the web browser but why should you have to i tried to download game none of which would even load in short i owned it le than hour waste of my time save your money and buy a samsung galaxy tablet
it can do a lot of thing we have been using it fro music and news for the short time we have had it
my daughter will be able to use that tablet for prime video
i enjoy this product i own in addition to the fire stick in the kid room
great kindle very easy to use and download book and read

my kid really enjoyed this tablet it kid friendly
the kindle fire have been great for the grandbabies
this is my send kindle and i uld not be happier i uld not believe i would be happy with something so small but it is great and easy to take along anywhere
in the past i used google for information that i needed but now i just ask alexa it is more versatile than siri and it is ready to go just my saying her name yes it is a little bit of a toy but then what electronics are not
you get what you pay for definitely not an ipad but they work great for our kid
i love my tablet it is great for reading book and also playing game
she love it u it for everything she get her homework done on it a well
if u r an amazon customer the fire is a great tablet to shop on
i didnt realize how much i would actually use this thing she doe everything my year old u it for school i use it for everything else
i love my old kindle but after a few year and drop the power button doe not like to work a lot of the time so took advantage black friday deal to replace the one that is going out
i have used a kindle fire for year and love it but wanted something more light weight to use specifically for reading book the paperwhite is very light weight and it is easy to use the touch screen is not always a responsive a i d like it to be when on the home screen or managing your library but once you have opened a book it is easy on the eye and page turning is very responsive i m glad i have this option for reading a it is much better than reading on the fire if you want a full tablet get a fire but it you just want to read the paperwhite is great
i bought this tablet for my grandson and he love it plenty of memory good enough sized screen for him to read and play game on mpact enough to be easy to carry around
overall it is a nice looking ver and doe it is job well it is simple elegant and slick when i say slick i do not necessarily mean cleverly devised i mean slippery the smooth leather provides next to no grip on the ver i have a tendency to hold thing lightly so i can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand sure it doe not have a band clasp etc to keep it closed but neither did kindle is ver and neither doe nearly every book ever published it is too expensive i do not understand why amazon is charging so much nsidering they ll be offering another ver with additional functionality for half the price amazonbasics leather folio ver with multi angle adjustable stand for kindle touch kindle black what the heckpros prettyfunctionalns slipperyexpensive
this is a great product great for teenager to read and play
i bought that for my parent great product easy to operate they love it also great price thank you best buy
an awesome product getting my money is worth i would truly remmend this product
my mom is an avid tablet user and i glad she got what she wanted
my wife purchased this for my daughter great for learning to read
nice tablet for kid a little slow loading the fire time is extremely hard for child to operate i guess it is ok for kid and beginner i have not decided if we are going to keep it or return it
the product work fine but you need to install a bunch of apps to use to it full potential
far and away blow away the echo dot in term of sound quality the higher st is offset by the need to purchase a decent quality bluetooth speaker for the dot
easy to use a a beginner i found this pad very good enjoy the kindle app
not to much to mplain about for le than dollar you get an in tablet that ha pretty good spec expandable storage long battery life great speaker fast processor decent camera and hi def screen easy to use and well built tablet the only knock is the included add but after using it for awhile you barely notice it
great tablet the price already preloaded with amazon apps easy to use
bought this a a surprise gift and the recipient love it
i returned this to the store cuz i realised i didnneed music or lighting ntrol i replaced it with the echo dot disappointed because didnknow i needed wifi which i do not have
this is a great easy little mputer to have if you just want something to access the internet that doe not require a phone ntract we are using it to run training video off our training website so we can do shoulder to shoulder training work out great for that
this wa bought a a christmas present for my other half she is enjoying it very much and it is user friendly
this is great little tablet that is very user friendly and lightweight
the echo is pretty fun to use but is definitely more useful when paired with other smart home device i can ntrol my lifx bulb and my ebee smart thermostat with voice mmands she is also programmed with some funny line and is fun to chat with to see what she say
a very good tablet with a lot of feature for a very reasonable price
great tablet e reader you can do a lot on this bad boy
work good not sure if prime make getting free book better or not but she get a lot of em
this is a nice ereader it is hard to activate without wifi access but ebooks can be loaded through usb connection
not a good a roku but still a good product started using it and kind of liking it for buck i think it is a good price and product
this ha replaced my laptop for out and about easy to use in addition i can now read e book and listen to audio book so nvenient
would have liked more feature for the money paid
ha good sound for little speaker good for getting information with out getting up
i bought this a first tablet i m disappointed in the battery life i sort of expected better especially a i got hooked on online game
bought this a part of the black friday sale for it serf well a a light use tablet skype e mail video etc the ad and heavy amazon product front load push are annoying cannot change or hide any preloaded feature cannot mplain much for the price and the fact that i wonbreak a sweat if it fall out my car or get misplaced

i love that you can read book a well a play game with this tablet i bought of them for my little boy and girl we just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trip they are quite the only thing is i wish they would have a section of game that can be played without wifi some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not overall though i love this tablet
cancelled my cable and i saved a lot of money from this
i m nstantly using this to watch movie almost replaced the need for cable
so much fun i ntinue receiving update i do have to ntinue reading new thing to do with it
i had a first generation one and still in good shape i purchased this new one mainly because of it updated o it seems also lighter the performance is quite satisfactory the sd feature is an important upgraded feature to the previous model the only drawback is it over simplified wrapping even simpler than most low end smart phone
had a very very old kindle so this wa quite a change like the size the paperwhite didnthink i would and the back lighting
ntrol it all with your voice need i say more very user friendly and easy to set up once you start using echo you will wonder why you didnbefore
like the voice mmand option to search for show i want to watch
love it but at time it just go black i have to unplug and hook back up order for it to work sometimes multiple time same with the reg fire stick that i have on anther tv
i enjoy the access to alot of the apps wish there were more sport apps though
my son love the tablet i like that amazon give you free unlimited downloads for two year
good interface but not a good a the apple tv i got it so we can get our cable tv app on our tv
bought for my kid year old kid worth a buy remmended
i went into best but to buy another reader but ended up buying a fire good value and ha the thing i need in a reader
i have been very pleased with the ease of use of my echo easy set up great to listen to spotify on
so far so good work a expected but it will be more useful when we purchase additional accessory to connect it to more part of the house voice regnition is excellent even from another room
i got a kindle fire when they first came out time to update and great choice good graphic great for catching up on your favorite show better than watching on a phone
i got this tablet for on black friday plenty of speed for surfing the web and playing game the screen look pretty good for budget tablet my year love watching movie and playing free game with it and setting screen time limit and other parental ntrols make it a great buy
i absolutely love my new kindle the size is perfect my kid and i cannot put it down
amazon fire is the best one out the roku and apple tv bedside it accept bird party apps if u know what i mean
very light very well made feel durable easy to use everything amazon
if you have amazon prime this is a no brainer i have a samsung smart tv and this work much better for streaming it ha wireless ac a well a n and connected to my ac network without any problem it can also be hardwired to your router if needed i really like the hdmi out which i can feed through my avr the out to the tv just like a blu ray player connection wa a simple a plugging it in and connecting an hdmi cable to my avr k streaming is glitch free and the voice remote work very well too easily worth the buck
i wa a total smart technology novice when i purchased my lil tablet on black friday for abt buck did not own a single smart gadget i still have a dumb phone i am pleased to say that the lil tablet is pretty easy to use and doe lot of fun trick so to speak thank you lil tablet for bringing me painlessly into the st century i would certainly remmend it to a beginner like myself and i do not think it is beneath the nsideration of a tech saavier person
overall i have been very happy with my new kindle voyage the screen is much sharper than my wife is paperwhite v and the backlight is much more even i have also been very happy with the page turn button it make it significantly more nvenient to turn page than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right the only issue i have that keep this from earning star is that the backlight on the screen ha a slightly two tone hue it is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen it is not something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it fix this so the loring is even and it is really a perfect ereader
kindle is more fun than a spindle your reading time will never dwindle
this is a nice little tablet it is definetly worth the price
you cannot beat the price great deal for what you re paying
this is an absolute life saver for small child
i bought the kindle fire after i upgraded my primary tablet to a inch the inch wa too big to take to a ffee shop to read or to use outside this is perfect size i put a gb a card in it to hold my book i can down load a uple of book and take it on the road
excellant starter tablet i love that it is preset with child in mind and i love the lors
bought for my kid for christmas and they both love them bought one for each kid
i love the new kindle fire hd i love the large screen to watch movie on
we bought this for our teenage son it is easy to use and he love it we ended up purchasing another for our year old daughter
this is a new tab upgrade for me a i have had my previous kindle for over year and love it
great table for the price you can download game and so much more it great for young kid
this work great for voice ntrol of my samsung smartthings for home automation
got this newer charger a it wa indicated to charge faster than the one that came with my fire hdx th generation tablet well i am currently using this new charger and am getting alert on the fire tablet that i am hooked up to a low power charger it is plugged directly into the wall socket with the ft micro usb cable i also just bought for it this is not right is it junk is it false advertising is the fire tablet wrong in it notification what is the deal amazon i have been a loyal user but this is really not right
we love alexa we play music and the quality is outstanding
i bought this tablet a a christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skill in unting and reading in english and foreign language she also enjoys having the tablet to read story to her a it light up the word for her to read along she love the ability to watch her favorite program a well this wa most definitely a worthwhile purchase
i do not like this tablet one bit it ha to be registered with amazon for it to function and it failed every time i finally had to resort to calling amazon is customer service also not an easy task to get it registered there seems to be glitch in the programming because when it failed again i had to follow the same step all over again to get it registered i would highly remmend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one mpany is operation programming or software
we use this for streaming and game it is a great value for the money
we had an old fire and upgraded to the fire hd love everything about it so far
we bought this tablet for my son to do his homeschool class on and he love it
great little tablet for my young family member and the price is right
this wa a christmas gift for mother and she love it because it allows her to play game and read instead of using her phone which is much smaller
you can go cheap for the regular kindle but in my opinion it worth the extra money to get the paperwhite model if you had both beside each other or sometimes read at night you d go with the paperwhite too
easy to use nice side and easy to read also very easy to load
great sound and syncs well with andriod phone good buy
excellent speaker love the portability and long lasting battery before a recharge is needed a very good digital assistant and lot of fun to use
this is a great set top box with plenty of apps that will keep anyone engaged for hour
i love the alexa voice service i cannoturn on my light and order pizza with my voice through the fire tv the apps are the same a any other medium device game are good too
love kindle fire bought for an elderly friend and she just love the ease of use
this is one of the best purchase i have gotten in the last month you can ask alexsa anything and she will give you a rrect answer i have also have the echo ntrolling my heating system and light a must have in the house
this is the rd fire in my family this one wa for my mother in law the other two are my wife and my kid these are easy to use and work well with amazon a you would expect i would remmend them a a starter tablet i have used both apple and galaxy tab and this one fit in well
i didnexpect a lot at this price but i also did not expect both of my tablet to be riddled with dead stuck pixel right out of the box i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for waiting on it arrival before doing the trip for return replacement just in case that one need to go a well maybe just bad luck but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be innvenienced by having to do a return everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issue but may be worth waiting until these defective lot have been disbursed and the issue have been rrected i am sure if you do not have these display issue that the product deserves more than star but if you can see thing from my perspective it is kind of difficult to remmend this to anyone for the time being if the display did not have these pixel issue i uld see this easily being a star remmendation if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot number that are more problematic than others so this is not just a rare incident if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home
the kindle paperwhite is the best bang for your buck when it me to purchasing an e reader
this is an amazing product i cannot get enough of it i use it everyday for hour never have to pay for movie ticket with this box plus it is also great for other apps game netflix tv show it is up to you
we purchased this in place of paying the sky high cable price for channel that we just do not use our tv is a roku smart tv but we found that we still needed this to gain access to a few station we have been very pleased with our purchase
great product amazon got it again can browse everything i need with ease
cannot stream smoothly unless plugged directly into the modem buffering wa horrible did not have this problem with roku even plugged in it ha some trouble with buffering at time only bought this because i got playstation vue and it only run on certain system unless you actually need the amazon fire to stream something only it can stream i would not remmend it roku is a much better system
the tablet stop working after the send week i uldnt find the receipt to return it it just beenllecting dust
it fast reliable what else uld you ask for this bad boy will knock out the mpetition and get rid of your cable bill for good it time to cut the rd people because fire tv is the future of entertainment
great tablet for the price add to that expandable memory and it is a great gift for the holiday
good product for cutting cable rd and saving money faster and more feature than roku or fire stick very pleased with product i originally received a defective remote best buy customer service wa excellent in trying to find a new one even from mpetitor they replaced with brand new unit same day i called even though best buy warranty expired week earlier
got this amazon echo because it wa half off the regular price it wa a fun surprise gift for my family
excelent tablet for kid easy to use and good parental protection
good item for child and is very inexpensive easy to hold and ha a ver designed for it
the whole reason for getting a fire stick wa to download kodi tv and additional addons to get streaming movie and tv i also have a fire tv for the largest tv in the house which is faster now that it is up and running i am going to cancel my cable tv and just keep the internet service
great tablet only thing needed is a better camera however for the price it cannot be beat
overall this is a decent tablet quite easy to set up take a few minute to run the update but you ll be up and running in minute or le build quality very impressive this is not a cheap feeling device it ha a nice weight and is very solid feeling the back of the device is a plastic type material but overall nice
set it up for my husband and he love it wa a great value for product
i love this tablet great for reading and keeping up with my email
wa not hard to set up and love the quality good screen size and clarity
it is voice activated capability is nice but not that responsive when the volume is full you have to keep your voice loud so it can hear you what is also nice is how it learns and can have multiple profile for family
i love my new tablet so easy to navigate and set up have used a little so far and have no issue with any of the apps installed program lot of thing to do
best thing on the market everybody just pick one of this up
purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two year old he loved it but the power rd and the tablet hook up didnwork very long i will be taking it back for a replacement a long a the connection stay snug it is a great tablet
i use this product all the time the screen is great and the ad are not obtrusive at all it ha great battery life you can send it book a well with the send to kindle application available at amazon
very fast n nice ui but ntroller quality not great dropped onced n middle part now rattle but the app ntroller work great and all apps n game are quick
th fire we have owned my daughter u it mostly
i have bought kindles over the last several year for me and the rest for gift have not had any problem with any of them
great little cheap android tablet doe not have the best of screen or speed but for the price it cant be beat
for the price i paid not having hd on the kindle wa no matter ha lot of storage and the kid are using it at school for their class assignment screen is big enough to read off of and everything is loading fairly fast kindle look to be durable
this should have been with the reader
bought it to read and i uld not resist the great price
i have two of these and four fire stick they are great for accessing amazon ntent and any of your other favorite streaming apps game with a moderate internet speed there is virtually no delay for programming to start alexa remote is handy so you can quickly search
i love that i mbines a tablet and a reader i do not need to bring two product around tough to beat at a price
this product work better than the smart tv function of our current tv simplifies the process and especially the search function no more clicking and scrolling thru the alphabet just speak it and let it search for you that alone is worth the
my wife is really happy with this a it ha the option to have the paper look or be backlit for reading in the dark she got the white one and love the fact it get free book since e are amazon prime member
we found there to be too many pop up ad and returned it
very easy to set up with an amazon prime acunt have not had to pay anything great for small kid like the protective ver that go on this device
purchased for daughter for school meet all expectation
other than occasionally misunderstanding and relentlessly asking u if we want to order xyz this is a great product that i believe is just at the beginning stage of all the possible u for it my kid and their friend love asking alexa to play music and i wa surprised that a tp link smart power switch i bought previously work with it to ntrol my living room light i just purchased a voice remote to go along with the echo so i can ntrol it from my bedroom while it is in the kitchen a few time when attempting to turn the living room light on or off alexa replied with ok but nothing happened this may be due to wireless ngestion or a blip for internet connectivity but something to keep in mind there is no status check to see if the mmand worked or not
i love alexa she is great for information and music it also keep the kid occupied
i bought an amazon fire tablet for my year old granddaughter and she love it it is easy to operate and charge
amazon hit the mark with this product good voice and sound quality
great product for the price easy to use can download game for the kid to use a well
this is better than having dish network or direct tv program in what you need and there it is
it is a little different than most android device but mpatible with them it wa a very small tiny learning curve but if you are like me and using amazon service like kindle music audible or prime then obviously the amazon kindle fire wa made with you in mind amazon underground is great for kid a it is offering game that are otherwise paid or have in app purchase for the incredible price of absolutely free it is amazing i do not know how they do that i have a llection of game that would have st me hundred on my ipad and there is the problem you are going to have to buy one of these for you kid when they find out or you can install amazon underground on their own android device
love being able to just ask it to do thing however there is a learning curve you have to also kind of teach it what you want
love the battery life the ability to read in sunlight
good value enjoy using it i remmend this highly
purchase echo a a gift owned mine for over a year and still learning from it planning on teaming it up with a uple of dot great tchnology
this wa a gift for my daughter at christmas it is a great basic tablet especially for the price the only thing i would say that is a n would be the lack of apps available v android or io
i m happy with the product all work perfect but the best buy employee attitude i do not like i m ask for the product and he told me if you do not see here we do not have it and i ask another employee and he show me the item from another place a very different attitude thank you
limit kid usage of electronics by time but still allow them to play a must buy for kid
this is a great tablet for kid and is very easy to set up
this thing work great it wa simple to set up and ha great sound all of my amazon prime music is available we keep it downstairs where we watch tv so it is available now we need a spot for the kitchen set a timer put item on the grocery list etc
pretty ol tech gadget to have around the house sync pandora and play your favorite song responds well to mmands can hear and regnizes her name from another room she know sport sres weather etc but she can also be stumped so far so good
i bought of these for my kid when we go on trip to play educational game and movie for the price they are nice to have i have had no mplaints with any of the kindle product that i have purchased
i bought it and been very happy with the product great to find stuff and specially music great sound too would remend to any one
got this kindle on black friday for a great price it is a good performer at a great price i use it a a nice versatile tablet not just for kindle bok reading
surprised now much we use our echo everyday do yourself a favor also get a bluetooth speaker and the echo remote
kindle fire is excellent device i personally have one a do all of my child at this point
like the ability to play a game or when i take a break from reading
i love the size and the well lit screen the word appear very crisp and easy to read
the kindle is just great for my mom who would mostly just read on it and download the bible
got this for my yo daughter a lot of the time it doe not work i have to restart it a lot and it only ha apps that i added on it it came with way too many pre loaded apps and the most annoying thing is that the kid profile is permanently horizontal not really worth the money for me but at least she is playing her inside out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my ipad
i bought this for my son some of his homework need to be done online and the tablet worked perfectly for it he uld also use it at the zoo to take picture and use it to play game
find movie and show quickly very easy to set up
not quite a easy to navigate a my old kindle if i press on a word to look it up sometimes i m not able to return to where i wa also i have not had an instance where highlighting a character name and using x ray give a description of the character it only skip to reference of the name that are ntained in the book in spite of these few shortmings i think it is a great product
these made great christmas gift for my family that is not too tech savvy but they love them and use it frequently
i bought of these tablet for my daughter i wonlie i wa a little nervous every at first because of the price but they turned out to be awesome my kid love them i have not bought their case yet but they seem to be very sturdy tablet
this fit perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is the price wa amazing didnfind it anywhere else close the the price
this is my rd alexa that i now have thru out my home this is one of the best product a home uld have hook it up to your thermostat and speak what temperature you want ask to turn on and off certain light play music give you the weather and a million thing more love it and each room i add one to just make it even better easy and user friendly for everyone
my grandmother enjoys this tablet it use a her reader
i have already read book on this and while it took a bit to get used to mpared to a physical book the nvenience factor make this a great purchase
we have a tv that already ha netflix and amazon but still wanted all our other apps that you just can get on other device we love this this thing and highly remmend it just ask alexa for stuff instantly you have music movie and shopping
this wa a great replacement for my previous kindle which is more than year old however i liked my old kindle well enough and i uld not justify an upgrade nsidering the more than price tag that is why i waited for a one day sale to pick up the paperwhite
love it work a expected would remmend this product
the idea is great a kindle just for kid design just for them with pre approved ntent the price wa great i got it for on black friday plus it ha a year full replacement warranty they break it we fix it is that simple ntent wow ton of apps interactive book and video user interface not the best one amazon should create a mputer base aplication to enable and edit all ntent
this is the perfect tablet for basic use or if upgrading from the kid edition of the amazon fire much le expensive than an ipad and more durable if you have a tween who is not always careful with their tech
this is a great medium device mostly use it for xbmc kodi but ha plenty of power for other function
we love the amazon echo i look forward to using it for shopping list
have another ereader but wa not able to read it outside this is much easier to read outside it ha lived up to expectation
good product for the beginner in the tablet arena without spending a fortune or paying for a name you do not know
this wa for an employee appreciation event the prize winner wa very excited about winning the amazon fire
easy to use and understand it is a great purchase
this item wa very easy to use from the very beginning and wa very responsive to my request and mmands i like the fact that you can also add other item to work with it
i thought this product would be a lot better than it is it is not a smart a they say it is it ha a long way to go
the image are crisp and text very easy to read apps are good and easy to navigate love it
perfect cheap device for kid and grandkids nice to have sitting around
the best part is it keep learning i use it a lot for my hue light and separate radio from my sonos
i previously purchased two of these for two other grandkids and they just love them and so doe mom she can set time limit can limit access and much more plus it me with a two year guarantee if the child break it they will replace it did i mention that there is a sd expansion card slot to increase the storage capacity these grandkids are to in age but older kid would enjoy this also

i have for decade an advocate for hardback book over time my biggest ncern now is space the kindle device is perfect for travel long wait line and for pure volume of llections unfortunately in today fast paced electronic age there is not a lot of room for hardback book kindle ha solved that problem
then what are you waiting for if you do not have the money or really not into technology then this product is not for you i have a iphone is and use siri not a much a i would like too cuz she doe not understand me all that great but alexa man she understands every word i say like flawlessly the reason why i m giving it star instead of is because of the skill now even tho it is over skill a lot of them are junk people made i wish more big developer would make some should be well known trivia game in here even if you had to buy them unless i m not looking in the right place the main thing i ll prolly use the echo for is to listen to music it is real easy to alexa to play a song and it sound great
love it work great a lot of fun great for listening to music
i think this is a good tablet i will order more it load the game quickly
love the fact that it ha a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issue for listening in other room ha a decent amount of bass for the size
great unit at a great price for reading and storing recipe and oking
will be in the market to buy another one soon great job amazon
only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the kindlefire with any light in the room at all far worse than impossible in sunlight there should be some sort of temporary screen or other add on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright location
love not paying cable bill just wish we uld get sling blue
just purchased to replace my regular firestick the system run faster better processor it can handle the game alot better then the firestick the voice remote is a ol add on if you dont play game i wouldnt really recmend upgrading to the fire tv box just get the firestick hdmi and router cable arent included the wifi actually worked better then when it wa plugged in not sure why good purchase i would remend this over the chromecast or apple tv anyday
my usin are really happy nice working good looking
bought this for my six year old daughter easy to navigate the only knock is that is doe not have expandable memory
we bought this tablet for my son for christmas it is a decent tablet for a kid and the price is reasonable i would remmend it for a person who is not big on technology it is definitely not an ipad
easy to use just what i needed
i love this thing i use it to ntrol my hue light and music it is a great speaker too
i needed something that will easily connect to hotel wifi cause i travel a lot so researched all device and saw that the amazon fire wa meant to connect to hotel wifi with ease and i must that this device life up to what it say it hook up with to the hotel wifi with no problem great picture and fast steaming and i now use this at home a well i love it
i use the echo every day i play jeopardy with my kid it is very easy to set up and use my favorite skill is the list maker i just tell it what i need and it populates the list on my phone i have lamp connected to the echo and i can just tell alexa to turn it on and off i have used it more than once to find my phone and the selection of music is incredible and great sound
this is an amazing device i would remmend this to any reader

wish i didnhave to sign on with a card but great product
hadnreally checked into kindles tablet before doe more than i expected it too tho now i m a little disappointed that it is a little limited to amazon related and approved stuff the app store for the device is more limited even tho it u a form of android which mean no flash also but i m mostly using it for reading so i m happy with it and would remmend it the wa the perfect size for me the screen wa too small for reading mfortably and the wa too big a a handheld
we love our new echo i m sure a time go on it will just keep getting better with update

the only thing we do not like is that it had to stay plugged in to work

great performance prefer over the fire stick for the larger storage capacity and processing speed also ha the ability to be hard wired if wireless signal is too weak only drawback is the wire that run to from the box
this tablet serf it purpose well plenty powerful for an e reader and basic web surfing apps are limited to the version amazon ha which may not be the latest version mpared to the google store there is a way to get google apps on this tablet if you do a little research
my son is and he love it super easy to use for kid

used the product almost everyday and love the product
i like this kindle paperwork it work good and relative cheap
great addition to the house from everything for playing music on demand a timer ocean sound at night and the skill are always expanding well worth the purchase
this product ha a better processor with gb of ram plus the port rj sd card and usb the difference is big for the difference of the price it is logically faster than the firestick

it is fun and easy to listen to music get weather update etc on the useful side it make operating your light garage door and other item in your household working them is very nvenient
great little tablet for price great if have amazon prime
my son who is eight love this tablet great for road trip and really work for the price hey let is be honest kid need something to keep them busy this work fast easy to start up
i purchased for my husband but alexa is part of the family now she can play anything off the internet and can interact with u if we have any question but the best part is her yo momma joke
my first kindle wa not paperwhite so i wa not able to read at night but now i can read it whenever i want
great product user friendly and cannot be beaten for the promotion price
i found the fire tv to be a good box for streaming but not great two thing that stood out is the low internal drive space and so so speed i would remmend it with a clear understanding of the short fall
good product for beginner ha basic feature necessary
perfect for my four year old daughter w geek squad protection
always wanted something transportable bedside my phone this fit in my purse and is readily accessible for travel great product for internet accessibility
like this but doe not always get the mmands rrect doe not answer question the way the google version doe
what uld be better than a book a kindle voyage this wonderful device is easier to carry around than a book whenever i need to wait a few minute i whip out my kindle it is clear it work for a long time without recharging and it receives new book instantly i had been using an ipod with audio book for a long time but i got tired of the difficulty in searching for material it also lost my place unless i wa extremely careful this device is lightweight and slip easily into my handbag or pocket i also bought the origami case with it the kindle me on automatically when it is opened a great and useful device i love it
i really like it it is working out quite well for me wish i had bought one a lot sooner
this product allows me to save over a hundred dollar on my cable bill
it would not connect to internet tried at home at a uple of wi fi spot and at the store where i bought it
upgrading from an older kindle wow lighter crisper text is an understatement throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement pricey but if you want the best you wonbe disappointed
very good item can watch thousand of movie and tv show
overall this unit doe everything it is advertised to do it is hard to review something when it work exactly a described i have had no issue
very easy to setup and use especially like having music played
have not had that much experience with it yet but from what i have done so far it is been great fun love that it can be linked to my home security system also so grateful geek squad offer a free class on how to use it i plan on signing up for that soon
easy to use many option and apps to download kodi mpatible
intuitive to use for the built in amazon netflix etc etc and allows for streaming directly from the mputer too
bought this for my yr old grandson great buy for the price he love his new tablet
nothing but the best way to read book love the way it look and the fact that i can read anywhere
great tablet for reading book but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablet for game and movie
after ranting against e reader for year i decided that i uld use one for the long bus trip into and back from work tablet gave me eyestrain and one of my brother who happened to have the same problem with tablet reading suggested doing what he did and getting a paperwhite this thing is amazing i am now a firm believer the simplicity of it ntrols the portability and best buy is year extended warranty have made this something i always carry with me
awesome little tablet for the price not an ipad but fine for just watching netflix and other small task while on the go
got this a a gift for my boyfriend he love that it is very nvenient and easy to use
great i love it im glad i got it my nephew love it
easy set up fun to use and sound quality is surprisingly good in our large open area
stream much better than smart tv doe well worth it
this make three i have purchased this time a a gift it fun accurate and work
it all depends on what your using a dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not remmend this device it is better for light use on the safe side use for h a day h a day battery is the average but run down faster and over heat when playing a d game but if u are on tight budget it is useful another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them for example clash of clan racing rival which have decided to withdraw from the amazon ntract and delte there game off amazon app store and other bigger title omg even snapchat is not on there
this is ok for kid but the camera is not bright enough
i absolutely love my new kindle i ll never run out of good book to read again best buy had it delivered day before i even expected it to arrive uld not be happier
tryed the stick you wait a long time to receive any movie or show if you get it at all
first tablet for my daughter whose is only can navigate and use with ease for the st amazing value and love the ability to expand with the sd tied into amazon in certain respect but the platform still allows for a number of workarounds a cant miss for the st
great tab and the price cannot be beat only gripe is the fire o oh well
ive cut the cable rd thanks to the firestick
brought this tablet for my month old definitely worth it he mainly u it for learning game and youtube kid tv i m thinking of buying one for myself in the future it ha a front face camera however it is only megapixels so picture quality is not that great but other wise you will be happy if you decide to buy this tablet
the amazon echo can be a bit finicky when asking alexa to perform automation routine for example most of the time you must ask for a light by the exact name it ha been given you cannot say turn on my middle theater light if you named them mid theater light whereas my google home assistant can identify these are the same device hence my echo get to hear me swear frequently the sound is nice and rich unlike the echo dot that sound a bit cell phone ish
this item is a great upgrade from my last kindle everything is touch screen and is faster than before
i use this everyday my entire family enjoys using apps
this is a really nice e book reader nice white screen easy to read and operate for the price i am not sure you can beat this
amzon tap is great and fun bluetooth speaker with inbuilt alexa i cannotalk it to end of the room and it can still understand my mmands and play music ol device and i highly remmend it
present for daughter it is a good tablet at a great price
essentially it work well for it intended purpose
work great very responsive mpared to the fire stick
got this a gift for a friend she loved it and the thing she can do with it
we re having fun playing with that but sometimes it doe not answer the question that you ask it which is a little nfusing for u
this product allows is to stream almost all tv show and movie made we are able to look at old a well a new show
simple easy to use good parental ntrols i also loved the price
wa looking for a low priced tablet to access my kindle and magazine apps specifically the enomist what i didnrealize wa that this wa the ad version of the kindle so removing ad on it would not be possible w o fee and worse there is some limitation around some apps and everything located in the google play store so apps like the enomist were not available sooooo returned
love it take it with me everywhere not all of u are mputer technical savvy need better written printable instruction on how to use step step etc
everyone need one of these easy to use and fun to have

laods up quic k i love the voice remote awesome product
a fun and informative product it is used by the whole family
i bought this product to make thing a little simpilar in my life everything from shopping list to music to quick information on the run weather traffic news even sport sres the only knock on this is that when an amazon echo mmercial play and the actor say alexa the unit power on and answer i just wish there wa a way this uld separate my voice from the tv
i really enjoy using the fire tablet it is light weight and fit in my purse for caring around now i always have a good book to read
great gadget didngive it star because it ha no option for a battery must be plugged in for use also i thought it ntrolled the tv but apparently not speaker is ok for music if you do not like it loud
i go to hotel frequently and do not like satellite tv or their limited channel selection this small device connects easily to the wifi and all flat screen tv i have found life saver on a week training event
love this item work great and is so useful in the home
hate amazon the app store doe not have ol apps
after reading sres of review on multiple type of unit this amazon fire tv wa the choice for me very happy with my purchase

these kindle tablet are beginning to get pretty cheap especially when the other kid tablet are relatively close in pricing nothing ha gone wrong with this kindle a of now and our niece ha been enjoying it a kid acunt and adult acunt is made the kid acunts ha access to whatever the adult acunt allows this is pretty standard in kid tablet but this one handle it well it make it much easier
i purchased the amazon echo for my husband a a birthday gift he had been eyeing it for quite some time but it definitely seemed a little steep for what is essentially a bluetooth speaker but oh were we wrong the echo is one of the olest tech product we have ever had it make me feel like we are living in some futuristic home other than being an excellent bluetooth speaker which it is alexa set timer alarm stream music through many different apps tell you the status of your order on amazon etc we love it so much that we find ourselves searching for other product that pair with alexa to enable it to do even more for u we just bought our year old the echo dot for his birthday and he absolutely love asking alexa question and playing music very unique product and i cannot wait to see what new thing alexa can do over time
i bought it for my daughter and she loved it she is happy to have it and read book on it
speaker ha an excellent quality despite the small size the only disadvantage is the amazon echo feature not present in this one which you can just call alexa and she will answer you in this one a the name say you need to tap the button to wake alexa up
do not let the gb prevent you from buying this amazon tablet once you insert a micro sd card the tablet literally save everything to the micro sd be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kid play with it because the screen is not a scratch resistant a an ipad or a samsung galaxy tab for forty buck you just cannot find a better value and with amazon underground you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in app purchase yup all the in and token and gem and whatever else you want for free note that this thing me with ad but they only appear on the lock screen and actually are not that bad they are nicely designed and do not make your lock screen look janky other than that you ll want to have a prime membership so you cannotake advantage of the prime video and what not i remmend getting at least gb micro sd i believe it support up to gb to store picture video music etc obviously get a larger capacity card if you re a download junkie the picture it take are ok good enough for viewing on a screen but do not expect to be printing high quality pic with them screen quality is pretty good not sharp and crisp like a retina screen but i wa able to read my kindle book just fine the viewing angle is also decent and wonmake you feel cross eyed like some cheaper tablet out there battery life is very good on this tiny tablet something like hour with normal use video and game will probably drain the battery faster than anything else but it run every game i have thrown at it so far if you have kid the free time app is very ol you have to pay a small subscription like buck a month or something with prime but it give the kid access to a whole bunch of curated ntent game movie etc just for the little one so they do not mess with other apps or get into thing your stuff well that is all i cannothink of this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality if you re paranoid about scratch and dent get a case and screen protector and you re golden
fantastic product led to significant home automation
work great we are amazon prime so love the show i am using this with wireless
great addition to the home you can switch off light in other room use it to create appoint list and dance the morning into life using the amazon music feature
work well worth the price good quality product have not had a problem
i bought this for my dad work great for a novice that just need basic
it work well it is the same a using the firestick to me just st more
nice tablet great gift item give me flexibility in being able to check email and play game anywhere in the house my only wish is that the screen were a little larger
me on i bought a brand new amazon fire for i can download and read my book i can browse the internet i can probably do other thing if i ever get around to that it is not a pc it is not a gamer machine but what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay if you re actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty buck for this kindle you should probably ask yourself what do i expect to get for this price one steak dinner of a tank of gas a case of brew or something that is going to last for several year and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading you really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like i did have i nvinced you yet or are you expecting amazon to me to your door and hand you a new kindle for free
a i reviewed different tablet this tablet kept ming back a my best option for the item i wa looking for it is a great tablet but there are a few thing i do not really like about it i didnrealize that amazon ha it is own browser silk everything even your banking info go through amazon not sure i like that also item do not automatically close out when you leave a page and i have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple item it might just be that i am not that mputer savoy though i do know how to navigate my way around sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and wonregnize that i am attempting touch lastly the on off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side so i am often accidently shutting it down most annoying overall i am happy with my purchase and for the price i like it just wanted to point out the other item
this is a good tablet but mainly for reader there are a lot of apps for book and such but there are other apps you can download
bought this a a christmas present for my nephew it work great and is lightweight super portable
work great but i wishi uld get rid of the ad on the home screen
i wa not sure how much we would actually use the echo but to my delight we use it all the time i love that it is so easy to use and i seem to find more and more that i use it for
asesome
really like the voice mmands including mmands outside the typical movie tv expectation like the weather have not used it a much a i thought i would but set up for the thing i want to do is fair
paperwite is easy to hold a i have weak wrist light weight and so easy to turn page book download in sends with the light it is great to be able to read anywhere very small so it fit in my purse or a large pocket i thought it would be hard to read because of it is size but you can enlarge the letter to suit yourself enjoy the mpatibility of this little jewel it is great do not hasatate to buy yours a you will be very pleased

this is a great way to beat cable easy to set up
i bought this a a gift for my niece she love it very much
it is a good tablet for kid the only thing i really do not like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok
the processor is much faster and is pretty responsive
great product for the money this doe all and more than some for a great value
this item is no good will only last for month amazon basically tell you to f off
star because it worked time and stopped working returned it the very next day my husband is nexus charger and the belkin w charger that he got to replace this charger do a great job charging my kindle fire hdx
i bought this for my year old niece who ha autism and she love it great price and great tablet for kid
echo should be in everyone is home it provides so much entertainment music weather forecast shopping list and something to help organize your home
i bought an echo dot that i connected to an existing bluetooth speaker but the speaker wa too old and kept losing connection i went to best buy for a new speaker but while there i realized that buying the amazon echo would give me a decent speaker a well a verage in the rest of my house perfect
got it for my grandson he love it it is a very good tablet
so we looked at the same tablet set up for kid at got this one for and just installed the kid package great potty training tool
i absolutely love alexa the wake up name for the echo she tell me a funny fact every morning after i say alexa good morning then i tell her to play my favorite wake up song good morning starshine followed by the local weather and morning news i get free music all day long from amazon prime and i can always hear a chuck norris joke the sound quality is amazing mparable to a bose system and it wa perfect for our last party i get update all the time for new stuff alexa can do i love my echo and find it endlessly fascinating
i am very pleased with this purchase it is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily this kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare the only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night
it a tablet under that performs well and is reliable a must have
if you were looking for a tablet thats cheap this is it great for watching netflix
got this for my year old grandson he really like it a lot this is good for kid to learn responsibility using tablet

great tablet with a lot of worth apps and everything for a low price
i love the kindle although do then to drop them always get the insurance and best buy make it easy to replace them
bought off them all together go get your now work good when shopping online
echo is amazing take a few day for her to learn then seems to take on a personality a little disappointed to start with but downloaded apps and alexa is fun pretty much a toy here but can answe question play music just a fun extension to a mputer kid love it and so doe my husband
i have had a kindle since the very first generation and they have me along way since then this version is pretty handy read well and navigates okay for kindle it there wa any drawback i would say that the store shopping experience thru the actual kindle need improvement it is still very antiquated and seems antiquated mpared to today is browsing market
i have to admit that i wa quite surprised by this amazon fire tablet i have been using apple window and android for the past few year and never gave amazon a chance until a black friday deal at best buy it is responsive visually great and the o is quite easy to navigate i set this up with my younger son in mind and the parental ntrols are superb they vered everything i uld think of to prevent him from doing amazon also ha plenty of case to choose from for their own tablet the only thing and this just may take time is that i wish the app library wa more extensive mpared to apple and android other than that everything else is excellent
work
work great easy to use picture is great too not missing my cable bill at all
doe not understand anything i ask and not very good at answering question i am extremely disappointed
i absolutely love the echo i tell alexa what kind of music to play and she play it great a a timer in the kitchen ntrols my nest answer random question you may have and even tell joke i plan on buying more smart home device to get even more use from it
it is easy to use mpact enough to easily fit into my purse love carrying it with me wherever i go to read when i get some down time
the antenna with power booster pull in more than hd channel it take very little room and work very well great for supplementing cable on other set
found this tablet to be very intrusive with add almost forced to use credit card to make thing work
work better than roku plus apps like psvue were developed with more love roku also had some strange problem with working on a tv that requires hdmi to dvi
easy to use and good quality
so far work just a it should have not used it over wifi a i have it direct connected to my modem i love that it came with a remote but wish it uld use a universal one but the phone app work just ad well too wish there wa an off button not just sleep mode
the paperwhite is very mfortable to hold in one hand and lighting is noticeably improved
i will not remmend this one do slow and i ended up returning this product
i purchased the tablet a a gift for my child it wa very st effective and work great for their need
i came across this on sale and uld not pa it up turn out it run slower than i expected though my girlfriend ha an older version of this model and it just seems to run smoother than this one still a nice alternative for browsing shopping bill paying than wearing about my smartphone battery
wife bought this a gift she wa going to buy the newest one but they remmended this one instead good call
really easy to work with lot of extra good buy for kid and adult
so easy to use anywhere there is an outlet i had a charger that would work so i debated about buying this i m so glad i did
the echo is a great item with lot of mpatibility for the smart product i bought and is also good at being a decent radio music player when i m bored
love this device it is so much fun to use i listen to music including is classic get weather report traffic report late breaking news i can ntrol my lighting with echo
more poeerfyul than the fire stick same idea just bigger stronger and fastet

i bought this tablet for my year old granddaughter birthday and she love it work well and it is easy for her to operate

so easy to read defines word you are not familiar with
a lot of apps are inmplete doe not run apps that great and ha a lot of apps that are generic
mostly use to listen to music and checking the weather
echo wa very easy to set up even for someone le then tech savvy work great with philip hue sirius xm
looking for way to save on cable still required cable acunt to access many of the apps
great for the kid made for a great christmas present
after going over all of the info on most all of the tablet on the market i wa having trouble deciding which one to get but on black friday for for my first tablet i wa sold
purchased a a gift for my nephew he is wa very happy with this item no mplaints
very handy no more need to buy book keep this next to your bed
i have been using my echo for about day and i love it i use is to ntrol the light and fan in my home almost any song i ask it to play it will it tell me the traffic on the exact route i take to work and informs me of the weather it tell me the sres of my favorite sport team keep my shopping list and settle argument when my family cannot agree on a rrect answer to some random question it also make ordering thing from amazon a breeze it is nstantly learning new thing so it is getting better every day love it so much i bought one for my son and mother
purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update lost wifi connection during the download bricking the kindle this model ha dpi up from on the previous model with text it is barely if at all noticeable with any kind of graphic or ver image the increase in resolution is nicer unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen a it wa in the previous generation the voyager model supposedly ha better lighting but at twice the price it wa not worth it to me and the uneven bottom lighting is not bad but it is there and i would have thought amazon would have fixed that by now maybe it is a limitation of having light source v the on the voyager still the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice ereader noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welme subtle change easier on the eye like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh ntrasts overall highly remmended best ereader for the price
the echo is fun and friendly and certainly help with the kid math always fun to ask her random question and try out new skill have one in all the kid room great for music listening
the echo is so much fun to play with and work great with amazon and hue product it is very hard to get it to work with our iphone and itunes i cannot figure out how to get my itunes playlist to work or sync it to my calander from phone i m sure it is possible because my tech skill are mediocre at best had i known what a pain this would be i would have looked into the google product more closely the echo itself is a great product but i would not buy it again unless they open it up to other provider service

this product is exactly a i expected it to be no mplaints
my daughter ha had an echo for sometime now and i have always wanted one i wa however really surprised when i received one of my very own from my son for christmas
while there are some apps that are missing due to not using the google play store the list is minimal the tablet itself is quick responsive and noticeable nicer than the fire picked this up when it wa on sale for black friday sale it is great for in front of the tv and catching up on email and light web browsing
i have tried apple tv chromecast original fire stick and i love this one the best easy to use and setup voice search is nice much better if you have add on product like netflix hulu or kodi only beef is the poor ntent selection from amazon
i think this is the best purchase i have made all year nothing better to say
my wife wa getting frustrated that she uld not see the screen on her nook samsung tab when she would be on the beach or out in the sun both place she want to read after mparing review of the kindle and the nook glowlight plus she chose the kindle and ha been quite happy with the decision she get most of her book from our library with overdrive and ha had no problem with downloading them from amazon the kindle is light and hold and feel like a book she added a ver off amazon so it turn on and off when it is opened closed she like being able to read out on our deck or in the sunroom just a easily a she doe inside
i got a fire stick and have noticed that it wa a mistake in not having waited for the amazon firev instead the performance in this firev is great performs faster and easier than it st fire stick glad i got it
alexa is helpful and of urse the bluetooth feature is great
i bought this tablet for my year old little sister i downloaded youtube apps and kid apps on this tablet she really like it overall very good tablet for beginner in reasonable price

this ha all the benefit of the echo for a slightly better price i also love the portability
i bought this to replace my kindle white and it is very good
this is the send kindle paperwhite we have purchased for one of our grand child this is a great tool to promote reading for kid or adult this tool mbined with amazon is available online subscription or purchasing book individually is the way to go
i have had this tablet for several month now and have had no problem with it in screen is perfect easy to hold not too big or too small gb rom about gb available after update and built in apps is good if you do not have a lot of apps or game the ram uld be bigger but it doe not lag even with some medium gaming ghz processor is not for heavy gaming but for everyday use is great the battery life is excellent i would say easily hour or to if gaming while this is not a hd display the lors are sharp some glare if in the sun camera suck but decent for the price no issue connecting and syncing my data to my amazon acunt if you are an amazon prime member definitely buy this tablet and even if you are not this tablet give you a lot for the price i wish amazon would offer more than day warranty but overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase
my old kindle died so i got a new one there were only two option available so i got the one that ha a backlight it is very easy to read on the beach in bright sunlight and i love the backlight it doe not strain my eye like the ipad doe
this is amazing and who can beat the price feature and apps work well a well a touch sensitivity
i am glad i got one for christmas e a send one for new year
i m pretty happy with this just take a little bit of time to figure out were everything is at
excellent product
excellent product tone of fun and super usability
have not used product yet still reading user guide
just picked up from bb a uple of hour ago screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory battery so far seems very good
the touch and loading the ntent is very bad it doe not respond quickly and it very slow
i am pleasantly surprised with amazon is new th generation kindle fire a a purchaser of a st generation kindle fire i welmed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microsd slot this version of the fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device the new o seems to work well in spite of the mmercial aspect after finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ad my fire became more enjoyable this feature wa not a surprise but what i would expect in a device from amazon and it esystem the kindle fire is an excellent inch tablet for it price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablet for the newby
my kid have the older model fire smaller version they can spend hour on it this is bigger better version with a larger screen size each child is getting a different lor so they know whose is which
bought three of these during the black friday sale for family gift everyone loved them cheap and fun little tablet to have

really ol and the speaker is great for any room
i still have my own kindle since a few year ago and it still work i love it and my grandkids both love their kindles
i am loving my new kindle fire it is so easy to use and downloading is a breeze the connectivity is great also
i love my new kindle purchased on sale for which wa a great value light mpact super easy to use a big plus for me wa that with this version you can add more memory
i have two of these and three fire tv stick both product are great the customization the store availability of streaming service access to prime benefit alexa the voice remote these are all great thing on both product having the ability to plug in external storage and ethernet make me a happy user the additional processing power is noticeable in response time of the interface i also have a variety of apple tv i appreciate dev access to these device but that is definitely a poweruser thing
after all the great review i thought it would be wonderful to use a a helping hand running a business solo however for this case it is not very helpful unlike rtana or siri alexa only work with mmands based on the petty apps that can generate the mmands it cannot use your whole phone or mputer to pull up apps or anything special even the simple stuff like weather wa a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar and anything you want to learn just refers back to the alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful you cannot use your own calendar alone everything ha to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created i think this will be great in the future but a far a office go it seems an unnecessary false luxury at home with smart appliance may be it only use remmended for home entertainment use only
nice and mpact short time to charge good product
perfect for my grandson i love the easy to use set up and parental ntrol i have remmended this to my friend for her child case is great
alexa is pretty fun i feel a though with update and more skill to me in the future she will be even more helpful a an actual speaker or sound system it is just ok you do not really get the deep rich tone that you would with a larger higher quality system but for like echo and alexa is a good deal
the apps are better it charge faster and the camera is really neat
i went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died i loved my kindle and decided to get in with the fire it is perfect for my need
i love that this tablet ha a variety of apps that can be easily be taken to place
this tablet is great for kid my grandson is sick and he absolutely love it
since it is called powerfast i thought it is a fast charger but it is not fast at all it worked but it took about hour to charge an almost empty kindle fire hd inch tablet
i use this while underway and it is a perfect size to travel with
this device is like an all in one entertainment machine i really enjoy how easy it is to use and what is even better is that i am able to stream playstation vue through this device now i can cancel my expensive cable subscription and just keep on vueing right now my uch potatoe life is on fire
pretty good sound for the size and nfiguration of speaker easy to set up
a friend and my neighbor have echo dot after talking with them i purchased one and am very pleased with it especially i like being able to listen to my favorite local radio station a well a sirius xm the sound quality is excellent
reception and wi fi interface is outstanding much better than roku
great addition to the family room easy to set up and use
the ability to expand the memory ease of use and k mparability make this a versital package entertainment tool
good for teen that use it primarily for gaming video
easy to use the only problem appears to be with the remote ntrol seems like it stop working at least once a week
alexa is my new best friend i wa able to set up the amazon echo rather quickly it wa harder to unpack the device than to set it up i love to listen to the music and play jeopardy i can even ask alexa to turn on my light you need a smart plug to do this it is an added st but worth it
i have ipad so wa not sure how i would feel about buying this pad but it work great and enjoyed using it for the price you pay it is diffidently worth it
this is great for the price it is slow on certain application
the kindle fire is a great tablet for the price nice screen fairly easy to use lot of game and apps this wa a gift for my mom who is not the most tech saavy and she like it a lot
easy to navigate daughter love it it is lightweigh and it just what she needed for this avid reader
bought this a a gift for my mother so that she uld watch netflix and hulu while in the hospital took her a bit to get used to a she wa used to her ipad but overall i like this product only drawback is lack of appstore ntent namely clash of clan clash royale pokemon go etc
what do you get someone who just turned a kindle fire he love reading and is absolutely thrilled to now own one more importantly he is excited about not having to go to the library each week
i love my kindle fire tablet purchased this one to replace a stolen one
i have used both paperwhite and voyage and voyage ha improved it support on the file allowing you to customize the format especially when you are reading in a foreign language
this tablet is definitely remmended if you are looking for light to medium usage tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available though you can install them using black market
i never have any issue with this mpany or product

take a little to set up but work great and improves each day

siri is great but alexa take hint up a notch i have gotten philip hue bulb and love that i can ntrol light throughout my house by just asking alexa to manage them
i picked up this tablet when it wa on sale it wa not a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an ipad but for the price the tablet is very powerful with amazon prime i uld do much more than i expected my mplaint is that the front facing camera zoom too much on your face also there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve but it is definitely worth buying a a backup tablet
bought this tablet a a gift for my grandfather for christmas and he love it very user friendly it is also lightweight and easy to travel with
i have not figured it out yet so far it seems ok but i have not used all of it potential yet
my daughter love it and is amazing thanks and i will remmend it
i got this on black friday for unbelievable price of it doe not have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over gig amazon ha it own browser and it wa very easy to set up if you want a decent tablet that you do not expect too much from then this is it

got this to read on the train too man ad ipad only from now on
i love having alexa around when you have your hand full you can still get information or set a timer without having to empty your hand or wash the meatloaf off first i cannot wait to see what all she can do
alexa is a good friend and she is always ready to listen to me and if i do not know something she doe i would remmend
my first tablet and i really enjoy it portable and efficient
my mother love her tablet she ha been playing with it on a daily
we love this so much in our home we bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it they love watching their movie on it and playing different apps it is a really good value
i only have an older ipad to mpare this to but there is literally no mparison the fire tablet is lightweight connects ultra fast to wifi ha an easy to follow automatic set up and me with ton of feature that i m only beginning to explore i wa not expecting this at all i m a total nvert especially because the price is so reasonable too
got two of these for the grandkids they just love them we also have a kindle fire we use these for reading playing game etc
excellent buy a a gift for the young man it wa purchased for
we have it set up in the kitchen mainly use it to play music and give u the weather forecast she really is amaxing at answering general question
i love it only thing sometimes i gotta keep repeating the wake up name to get it started but after that it is great
this is a perfect device for the novice that expects superior performance and doe not mind paying a little extra no buffering and excellent quality
purchased on black friday deal for good buy not ipad quality but a fraction of the price and nice for watching prime video and normal apps would purchase at standard price also a a fun extra tablet
very light weight and easy to read in different lighting nditions doe not strain my eye like the kindle fire if reading at night i do wish bestbuy carried more option for case to fit the voyage they have none in the store at all
love it alexa listens well and play song i like
bought this at best buy only because amazon wa out of stock doe k video ton of apps that support it just make sure that your cable mpany is on the list of provider for standalone apps e g hbo go disvery history travel channel etc else you ll find yourself not able to watch their specific ntent on this box bought it mainly because i use playstation vue to stream ntent and hate the tile setup on roku p vue on the fire tv is a timeline setup i prefer this much more than the roku setup great box work flawlessly with alexa and prime membership imo worth the plus i got a free day trial of sling although i think the sling trial is a n more than a pro hahaha
the price for this tablet is not the only great selling point the free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son there are ton of game book and video in this service my favorite feature is how we can set time limit on screen time we can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to game is allowed great choice for kid
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
bought two of these for my niece they are truly enjoying them just what they asked for
we bought this for our two year old grandchild he love it we set up a screen name for him and he play on it every night he ha dropped it several time and it is fine nothing at all wrong with it very durable
great tv app viewer menu are crisp and the ntent first rate
the best product to me out of amazon just love my echo work well a smart hub
first time i have ever used a kindle fire and i wa not disappointed it is very good tablet the only downside is that there are not that many apps like the google store ha
wa able to get this on black friday awesome deal for an awesome tablet
we check local weather and enjoy music we get answears to question
i bought this for my girlfriend a a christmas present she is a avid reader and ha been using our ipad to read online library book she asked me for a nook reader but after seeing the fire it wa a no brainer to go in that direction it is used everyday and she love it
great product for reader low on eye take time to get used to
it ol for kid and safe with the case if your kid dropped
great gift for those who read and also enjoy youtube
awesome product very glad i made the small investment to get this i do not even have to use my cable anymore because of this small device
unable to use for anything but kindle and this severely limit it usefulness the screen is very readable in sunlight nice feature
it is nice product i like the design very helpful product
great charger somewhat pricey however if you attatch it to the cable that me with the e book reader this allows you to plug it into a wall socket
love this tablet it doe everything access the web downloads apps game music movie you name it i also purchased a ver and stylus pen for this tablet for under you wont find a better deal
bought these for my boy and they love them ton of feature and battery to keep the boy playing
it is a nice fast table with upgradable memory app store provided by amazon is ok limited good apps it is not google or io store but still ok screen resolution is great in hd streaming work really well i remmend this tablet because it is also easy to hold very thin and light
very great product very great product very great product
ol a lot of movie and tv i would not get otherwise
purchased of these and am real satisfied with them
overall a good tablet the screen is crisp enough to enjoy video the only downside is the built in speaker even with headphone the sound quality is not top notch just average if you re not looking to do anything fancy it is a good deal
there are many apps and book available for free with this tablet so it is very entertaining it make shopping online easy too with the amazon store app
i assumed this item would have a rd with the plug never assume it wa the plug only the rd on my kindle is very short so i bought a foot rd also now i keep the shorter rd with me so i can charge on the go the longer rd and new plug are what i use at home satisfied
device serf my intended purpose very well clear screen and easy maneuvering
i really enjoy my new kindle i can read in the dark i can have all my book without taking up space and the battery last a long time
nit sure wa is gift not sure what the product is like
the tablet ha a very clear and crisp screen the device is easy to setup there is a quite abit of preinstalled apps the responsiveness is great connectivity is good but sound is not great
this is the best e reader great quality great price
really ol looking in person purchased this and other echo dot to work together it definitely can hear you from a distance it operates my lifx light but doe not change the lors if i ask it to it doe not work well with pandora to pick station so not sure how to get it to do that it only remembers the last station that i wa playing lot of home automation integration being able to set my alarm just by talking is better than a clock next to the bed overall lot of great feature take time to learn what it can do overall this one is the best if you want a louder speaker than the echo dot and it actually look ol too
it work well for what i needed i purchased for great price on black friday
this serf every function i need in a tablet price is right
picture is top notch k capable also something i disvered on my own that the expert in the store did not know or tell me even though you do not have a k capable tv the fire box may still be what you want instead of the fire stick here is why when you watch live news or sport they are broadcast at frame per send the fire stick only can produce frame per send so the picture look somehow previously rerded jusy not like a sharp high def pucture so i replaced the fire stick on my p capable tv with the fire box and bingo perfect because it can reproduce frame per send you ll see the difference trust me
bought these for my kid and they love it love amazon
work great easy to setup simple to navagate layout and option are easily to use
nice inexpensive tablet for my grandson to learn on and play game
i wa a loyal roku but since i got a k tv i wanted something that streamed k the fire tv ha a lot of good quality but the fact it nstantly reset randomly is frustrating for sure i have the highest speed internet via mcast so i do not understand why it is doing that amazon prime is great so it is not bad just need the bug worked out for a higher rating from me
this work well for those that like movie i personally appreciate the ease of use
i mean it work fine but fine there is nothing special here and it is a joke that amazon doe not just ship a charging plug with the kindle in the first place you should be able to find plenty of non oem charger that ll work in term of watt and voltage for far le money like
i had brought this for my daughter and father they love it
this product would not turn on nor charge and then store uld not locate another one for me
i wa hoping he would not want to put it down like the other tablet he had sprout chubby but he still want my phone
awesome tablet the best i ever bought for great screen great angle and fast even two month in and alot of apps bought it for my little sister and two month later still going strong
believe it or not i purchased this for my year old grandson and he is doing real fine with it
i really like that my child is engaged with all of the different apps we have downloaded
favorite part wa how easy it is to read at night
absolutely love this device way better than kindle app on ipad or on droid phone
my son love his amazon echo it is a ol gadget to have
easy installation and easy to use i use it for timer music weather information and am anxious to try using more feature in the near future a i have had it only about week i cannot imagine not having it anymore
serf it purpose
i had just about every android box out there and this is my favorite i hate the fire stick but love this if you want something that work great get this
it work like advertised the only issue i have is it can hear you when you are listening to music on volume level or higher
book and magazine are easy to access and read
the fire is a basic tablet but it is the best i have seen for
the best remote for the price you cannot beat it easy to use
this is my husband is send paperwhite because the first received water damage when his waterproof case leaked he bought a nook at a pawnshop because it wa cheap but he missed his kindle bought this one for his birthday
we purchased this a a replacement for our now broken ipad though we liked the smaller size more nvenient easier to carry etc the internet wa sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove u crazy sometimes minute to download a site and this with no other apps open plan to go back to another ipad
so much better than my year fire for versatility
perfect for on the go use especially when your charging your phone wonderful product very impressed
i love it so much high remmend alexa will be your friend
my year old son really enjoys the tablet it is great
excelent product cheap and great quality love it
i purchased for my son he said it is the best gift he ha ever received
not the best and the brightest in the market bought two of them and one got damaged within the send month best buy wa not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long
do not bother wasting the extra money on the official amazon kid fire tablet we got this with a nice case and gb sd card both of those from amazon for cheaper than the bundle price from amazon directly
alexa help u with shopping answering question and finding new music
the fire stick is the holy grail of entertainment easy to set up and easy to use the apps are user friendly and easy to navigate
one of the best tablet on the market for it value
i own both a amazon fire tv and fire stick the amazon fire tv is by far superior than the fire stick the fire tv is perfect for all in one entertainment and perfect if you re looking to get rid of cable satellite tv also very ideal for kodi
this product is great for reading especially in the sun
i bought the fire kindle to get good read from amazon the tablet is great for other apps such a facebook internet search game and various apps from amazon like yahoo mail online banking app ect ideal for reader and those who would like a simple tablet would remmend getting case which i purchased when i bought the fire kindle nice graphic and user friendly for the price
this amazon fire tablet is amazing it is not an ipad or galaxy but it still pack a ton of value into a nice package you get a lot of nice feature here and not a lot of bull a one would often expect from a device so cheap the screen is surprisingly well made and durable while it is not the sharpest one out there it is not exactly blurry either at x pixel there is only a single speaker and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen the speaker get to a decent volume but i would not nsider it to be loud i took a leap of faith here in buying this and i am so very glad that i did because this tablet ha far surpassed my expectation in every way the game are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what i have seen so far this play demanding d game pretty well i may add the amazon store ha a lot of ol free thing to mess with when you first start out it only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything the micro sd slot accepts up to gb card battery life is ok if not gaming on this you can expect hour or more with light use this uld last all day on a single charge video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright the responsiveness of the screen is spot on i cannot really mention any downfall because there really is not any the one thing i will say uld be better it the wifi when set to default setting wifi kept turning off on me once i set wifi up to be always on it wa much better you usually get what you pay for in this case you get more this unit feel like it uld have easily st well over i m just sad that i didnyet get a protective case for mine i would highly remmend this product to friend family or anyone who need a nice tablet or want a nice gift for someone this amazon fire inch tablet earns a solid out of star from me i m picky too if you are even slightly nsidering this just buy it you wonbe disappointed
it is a great phone for a great price it ha the latest android lollipop it also ha gb of internal memory
i got this for my birthday and love it sound good for size and increasing functionality all the time
i had to do o upgrade immediately after purchase and the process is manual would have been better if the o can upgrade itself similar to io or android o thing aside i love this device and it worth the money
very happy with the hd fire gb plenty of memory and easy to navigate i would definitely remmend this item
when i first grabbed an echo i thought it would be kinda gimmicky but i loved it so much i bought two more echo and several dot i have alexa all over the house the smart home integration is so wonderful i feel like i am living in star trek when alexa turn my light on and off and doe other task

little bit slow but perfect fit for my year old daughter
wife love it it is neat how it work and the info is endless music option are whatever you cannothink of
it is a very nvenient product for ebook reading more sophisticated
wish it would have more access to more info and after paying so much for device we got more service for free seems very expensive to purchase device and have to pay per month to get music book and etc
i bought this for my kid to play on it fill that aspect great but the battery might last two hour of ntinuous use

we gave this tablet to our nine year old grandaughter for her birthday she love it and we feel it is very sturdy that is a very good thing when it me to tablet and child
at ninety dollar the expectionations are low but this is still a very good table it is good for light use like watching video or web browsing but the camera is a bit lacking and at certain time the device can freeze or lag overall this is a good tablet for i would remmend this to anyone on a budget
i bought two of these for my grandchild because they wanted one and the price wa right they used one before and are very familiar with it they will love it
great tablet for not a lot of money would remmend
there is no substitute to the original amazon echo tall cylinder this unit ha the turn knob on top for volume ha a much louder speaker and is the basis of how alexa wa originally developed
bought for my year old daughter plenty of apps and battery life is solid
i wa using my ipad mini to read for a long time but felt like getting a dedicated device for reading since i am a prime member i ended up buying a kindle with no back light do not fool yourself led light and book light do no where near the same job a the paper white i can hold the device in one hand for long period of time and the light doe not wear my eye down like my ipad really love the paper white i m catching up on a lot more reading
very awesome tablet for kid and great parental ntrols
the store representative took his time with me to choose the right size and the lady at the check out got me hooked up with best buy program membership
great and alexia can ntrol my philip hue light
easy to use reading clarity and background light lor is perfect lot is of free book to download and lot is of category to choose from you can also sample book that you would like to purchase

a great gift for a year old aunt she u it everyday

work great love the screen sharpness very easy to use
system over all is fast and i mean for le that it very reliable the only downside it u almost of the internal storage already o and built in apps should have settled for gb or more other than that this toy is just ok

purchased this tablet for my two year old son it is easy for him to use and ha been surprisingly durable would remmend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child
if your familiar with echo you know what you re going to get alexa doe not have all the answer however price is pretty much the same everywhere
this amazon echo is simply amazing and a must have for any person and it pair we with the harmony remote simply wireless
i bought it for my daughter she seems to be entertained
i wa looking for a good small tablet at a reasonable price and i found the amazon fire tablet had all the feature i needed easy and fun to use
it ha so much functionality and is so easy to use the speaker are great so
work great terrific tablet for price would definitely remmend this tablet
this device is small and mpact and super light the word really stand out and look like a real book
had been thinking about purchasing this for some time and decided to take the plunge it wa easy to set up and the sound is very good which wa surprising it is in our kitchen so we use it in the morning when we are getting ready to leave for work and at night when we are preparing dinner it is useful for getting a brief rundown of the news listening to some local radio or playing some tune we have it set up with our nest but do not have anything else really automated so i cannot mment on that i probably paid more attention to alexa initially when we bought it but now can go day without speaking to alexa cannot we all
i purchased fire tablet for my foster child and i must say i love them the fire give parent so much ntrol over what the kid can do it the best feature is the curfew it ha on it you can set it for a time to me on and off and more than anything you can set it so they will have to spend a certain amount of time on educational activity before it allows them to start watching video or playing game etc i love it
i bought this to replace my failing kindle keyboard i absolutely love it the only n i have found is battery life with airplane mode off it drain rather quickly with it off turn airplane mode on and it is great
who need a laptop that take up so much space go for this amaon fire that fit in your hand it ha capability for multiple acunts and time limit for child or even your spouse worth the price and very nvenient no lap required
love this box so much no longer need cable love being able to watch all my favorite movie and tv show
i wa looking for a tablet within a reasonable price range after doing a little research i decided to give the kindle a try and it wa a great decision it ha so many u and make it so much easier to get thing done than using my phone i would remmend for any age
it took a bit for me to get used to the kindle a i wa used to reading the book on my phone with the kindle app i wa a bit bummed with losing the lor i also donâlike that it ha no sound other than that it is a nice lightweight device with a good battery life at first i thought it wa defective because it froze up the first time i plugged in the usb it actually stayed frozen for a uple day before it finally started working again
they really enjoy it and i will buy it again for another gift
had several fire stick and thought let is try this got it in sale it just so fast would remmend for sure
did not have a usb at home that worked with this kindle this wa a must have
this is my send kindle fire and this is a great improvement from my st generation version with micro sd capability i can download and store so much more paired with amazon prime and i m never bored
bought his for the lady because she kept getting distracted when trying to read thing on the ipad plus the lighting on the ipad is a bit harsh when reading at night this wa the perfect answer to both of those thing
bought this product online and le than an hour i wa able to pick the product in store super love it
wa remmended to purchase by a family member who ha one who is very happy with it
fun to play with wa alittle difficult to get all set up
easy to install ha everything that i need and more
love it really like the camera a my old one wa backwards and hard to use
i have the first generation kindle paperwhite and my fiance ha the latest and greatest the screen clarity and response time is greatly improved and it is still being offered at the same price if you re a bookworm who either read before bed and or travel a lot a kindle make a lot of sense i like that you can dial in the screen brightness so that you can still fall asleep after reading the battery life is great too
my daughter love her new tablet she doe everything on it
bought this for wife but it ha turned out to be a lot of fun for the household with all the feature
i absolutely love alexa it is the best purchase that i have made in a long time she is so handy and funny too i love that i can ask her to play my music ask for a recipe ask about the weather all within the mfort of my uch i d remmend this baby to everyone
work a expected great for watching tv without the need for cable or satellite
the echo is a very ol device that is simple to use alexa is very responsive
very nice doe almost everything i wanted it to do wish it is voice regnition wa a little better
these tablet work wonder for my need i didnt need a tablet to work only for web browsing and play some game nothing fancy this tablet fit perfectly for that and the price pff perfect you wont find this quality cheaper
great tablet for kid both of my child love it
the box wa well protected and shipping wa on time very satified
we now have of these in our home because we love this model kindle
this is the best device i have found for my e book i know it can be used for a lot more but it is my library in my hand
upgraded from generation kindle with button that had all the letter worn off to this newer generation kindle love the touchscreen and the ability to sit out on the patio with a fire and read all night without needing additional light
i like the tablet because it is a good size and east for a three year old to use
this is the first kindle i buy and i wa hoping to be a good experience which so far ha been you may not treat this device a a limited tablet since it is not it is a reader that work just fine for that if you mpare it you ll feel it lack speed or responsiveness but remember that this is just a reader and it work fine for that purpose the extra feature the backlight work pretty fine even at dark room without leaving you blind
i prefer the ipad but it is okay for the st just to many ad tho
just purchased the amazon fire gb model and so far it ha performed a expected only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and need nstant cleaning for smudge from normal use
this wa a gift for my wife she u it mostly a a facebook portal and love it
very good product so far working so good would remmend
i love alexa i m very busy person so i like the fact she will turn on my favorite radio station tell me brief news and order my favorite pizza from domino and play trivia game there is room for improvement but i got it on sale sonfor the money paid i m happy with it
purchased this for my mother for mother is day she is retired and love to play card on her laptop and read she doe not shop a lot and doe not have internet access at her home we bought this and my daughter u our mifi to download numerous book periodically for her she ha also downloaded numerous game for her to play she love having something smaller and so handy at her fingertip when she sits down to take a break during the day
wonderful educational tool for my niece with special need
he love electronics around christmas so this wa right up his alley he love telling alexa to do thing like turn up the thermostat or to play song
love this tablet i got it for my two toddler son and they love it a well
easy to use grandaughter wa thrilled
the way amazon ha set up their software is pretty great they make it easy to get connected to your hulu hbogo netflix or whatever streaming service you have plus if you are a prime member you are already loaded with streaming ntent straight from the box i have two fire tv and three firesticks would not change them for anything
protective fast and ha ton of fun game already on it our year old daughter like it too
decided to ditch cable and after my research decided to buy of these installed psvue on it for cable channel and do not have to pay equipment fee to the cable mpany anymore
uld not beat the value for this with the black friday price they are not the best tablet but they do a lot for the price
i bought this for my year old so she would have another option for watching her show besides my ipad needle to say she wa too frustrated with the slowness to load the netflix app and it would only get internet if you were in the same room a the modem you really do get what you pay for if you buy this do not unt on getting online very seamlessly the internet browser is really slow to use but you can get around this by downloading google play store to access the firefox app which is not offered on the amazon app store check youtube for instruction
firetv is the best streaming device this model have alexa
i bought the amazon fire tv to mod and stream medium it work fantastic and doe exactly what i want including k video output the primary reason i chose this item over the fire stick wa that i wanted wired ethernet and not wireless picture quality and sound is excellent
i liked that it is quick responsive and aduquate for most task the ability to add more space via micro sd card up to gb is helpful
nnects to home wifi automatically many book and many game actually function like a mputer tablet e mail is a breeze
it is very easy to set up and get started the graphic are very clear it ha everything you need
like that downloading book is fast i am still learning feature and have not explored other positive featured
nice for the price had to put google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
love this it is kidproof i have a active year old grandson who enjoy it very much
i bought this to stream hd music via bluetooth to my stereo work great and for the price offered cannot be beat
bought this for my daughter she love it work great she is dropped it several time and it just keep on working no issue at all
so much more than a reader kindle ha me a long way
this is my nd echo purchase i have had one for awhile this wa for my daughter we love alexa she is in our kitchen and help with everything recipe kid chore list grocery list music weather timer story teller the list is endless she get nfused occasionally but she is usually still amusing we are all glad she became part of our family
i am just learning all the possible function of my kindle fire but it already doe what i bought it for i hope that i will get more enjoyment a i explore it more fully
very easy to use and navigate my and year old grandson can use them with ease some apps are limited a you do not have google play but there is plenty of game and learning game available
i got of this for kid and it is a pretty good tablet easy to navigate for the child but and this is on me for not researching but kid ntent is only free for a year after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member but still now reason why i m about to return them you cannot get youtube kid at all no google apps you can get some youtube kid clone on the adult profile and add them to the kid is profile but they stink they re full of mmercials so i wa not expecting this tablet to be like an ipad but this is a deal breaker for me
excellent i love it high quality very responsive
the echo is interfaced to my home automation system which make ntrol of the house very easy
great product easy to set up and understand highly remended
i read a ton and this had made if much easier for me to have accessible book the light is perfect for my when my boyfriend is sleeping and i cannot put a book down
work great still trying to figure it all out but i have no problem so far i am looking forward to expanding my u for it but so far it make for a great speaker
wa very impressed by the quality of the picture would remmend to everyone
i got this on black friday weekend for it wa my nd fire it can do a lot but the thing that i like about it the most is that i cannotake it anywhere if i lose it or it get stolen i am only out the new feature that i like is blue shade i use my tablet in the evening with no worry that i will have trouble going to sleep
this is an excellent product at an excellent price
the amazon fire tv with model work great easy setup
i bought this for my year old grandson he asked for a tablet for christmas
the fire ha a great price you get your money is worth however you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one the one i bought had a busted pixel in the screen there wa no damage to the case or glass screen but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen is image i have owned multiple but i have never had this problem before with an epad tablet when i just bought it i will now have to visit best buy again tomorrow for an exchange i m hoping they re still in stock it is not best buy is fault the fault lie with amazon they re clearly not that durable
great item bought one for my yr old a a christmas gift ended up going back and getting one for my yr old and myself a well i am not good with electronics this is easy to use
amazing good quality great sound incredible range love it
i wa going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movie on something other than my phone while there are one which have more feature and better software the fire hd had a good price and wa available it had gotten good review and it performs well with great battery life if you re looking for a good basic tablet this is a nice option
the battery life had been incredible fit in my wife is hand mfortably she cannot wait to get her next book
wow i have had many tablet but none me close to this for the price the screen is clear and responsive while it me locked to amazon i sideloaded the nook app without root and then rooted it easily just for fun xda ha the detail
thinking that this would be just another gadget proved to be way off the amazon echo ha far exceeded our expectation the sound is stellar and the timing is spot on
i wanted a cheap tablet to watch movie on it stream all apps well netflix youtube and others the only mplaint is the internet browser is garbage i also have a fire tv and fire stick amazon product work well
if you are looking to add smart tv capability to your tv or replace existing smart tv capability this is the product to own in my opinion amazon knocked it out of the park with this streamer paired with a k tv it add amazing clarity to k ntent
it took me a good month to finally purchase one of these but now i am so glad i did i can ask alexa anything i would normally google set a timer for oking listen to music etc i have just purchased so i know there is so much more that can be done and i really look forward to learning more about the product i have liked the alexa fb page which give me new thing to try each day love this item
i like it but do not like the add screen that you cannot get rid of also can only download apps from the amazon store
this kindle is totally worth buying doe not have all the fancy bell and whistle that will almost never be used but ha exactly what you need to just enjoy a good read
the amazon dot with alexa wa the hit of the day at my back yard bbq the over the hill group had a blast requesting oldie from our day of youth music from all genre wa available from the is up to today is untry hit we also enjoyed bantering with alexa from time to time
the kindle is easiest to use graphic and screen crisp clear brilliant lors
alexa ha beme an addition to our family there is not one day that we do not ask alexa to help u out it is not an intimidating tool very user friendly
and this work perfect kindle doe not fail you will def get your money worth with this e reader
best little item that is been out mpact and fun to use
kid love it can downloead lot of game great charge system
easy to read and the book are easy to download and le expensive than paper book and save on the storage space that paper book require
i have used them all but when it me to performance this top them all it a very powerful device especially if you lan wire it i hardly experience buffering with my stream perfect for open source medium player such a kodi and plex
i love my amazon fire tablet i m sure my kid will love theirs too
we bought this a a replacement my daughter cracked the screen on her other one right before christmas we love it only issue we have is something she doe will make it so only half the apps game show however we like she can only play safe age appropriate game and do not have to worry when she is on it
i had previously purchased the fire stick it work good and had what you need i bought the tv model it is super fast i love it and would highly remmend it
when you buy an amazon product from best buy they will not take responsibility after two week and said to speak to amazon directly but you cannot return any amazon product bought from best buy to amazon do not buy amazon product from best buy but ever again a you are doomed with it
i bought it for my husband for a gift but i use it a much a he doe perfect size good sound quality overall great product
there is a lot of feature and we are just getting started with tap glad we made the purchase
i m using the echo and samsung is hub a the centerpiece of my home automation system since buying the echo i have also added several dot to build out the system it is a lot of fun to work with
bought it in order to watch nbc but the nbc app is not mpatible so now i have a paperweight
great tablet for kid or a stater tablet for someone
what a great device the paperwhite is much clearer to see than on an iphone or android easy on the eye
bought this for myself at christmas a a replacement for my older version this one ha clearer graphic but i find the build to be way cheaper and definitely a great deal thinner felt to flimsy to me
i have recently purchased a home and i have been set on a mission to make my home a connected a possible finding the right product lineup ha been interesting however the alexa product wa a no brainer in our house we are amazon prime member so we cannotake advantage of the music and day shipping order from alexa these are after thought a i bought alexa to ntrol my smart home setup with my voice many believe you can just buy alexa and ntrol your home this is not the case you can use alexa a a smart home hub with wemo product but this u wifi and the device easily connect and disnnect throughout the day if not setup properly in my setup i have a wink hub connected to z wave product around the home wink can also connect to online service like google is nest service and chamberlin myq garage but unfortunately they are not able to be directly ntrolled by alexa for the wink hub with that being said for z wave and zigbee product i cannotell alexa to turn on and off these product a well a if setup with a dimmer what percentage to set them at often time this is quicker than the wink app itself pro wink mpatible logitech harmony hub mpatible nest mpatible ifttt mpatible can read audible audio book sound from speaker can fill a fair sized family room make home automation more intelligent n sometimes doe not respond appropriately price is a bit high to summarize the alexa functionality of this product is limited unless you have amazon prime or device that can attach to it using it enabled skill would remmend a an accessory to a smart home or for someone invested in the amazon e system
the amazon fire tv is awesome it work so much better than my apple tv and i am a huge apple fan
superb sound quality with deep bass and loudness excellent voice regnition with noise cancelling lot of alexa apps with integration with logitech remote philip hue home automation device
had to spend hour on line to make it work on line
i purchased it for my dad he needed something easy to use he really enjoys it
best bang for the buck if your looking for a good tablet that do not st a lot just buy yourself a micro sd an you wonrun out of memory
the kindle fire wa a perfect gift for my wife she ha not been a big fan of newer electronics in general and needed something mpact affordable and very easy to use
bought this for my wife to replace her old one and she loved it
i really enjoy my kindle my only issue with it is that i cannot get some of the apps i normally use however it doe have most of them
bought this for my year old son this wa his send tablet just his speed
love being able to make specific profile for my child
great device really like the option to use either wifi or lan
my yo love it and never want to put it down lot of preloaded educational game and video
it is nice ol but it responds extremely slow mpared to modern tablet phone kindle is just too slow my expectation would be to make it faster even if i have to charge it often that would be ok sendly there should be a home button back button on the body of kindle
saw it at my friend is house and thought it would be fun to have it looking forward to more added function in the future i enjoy talking to alexa every morning and evening after i get home now i play spotify music and i heart radio through it and the speaker work great enjoy this new toy
my wife love her new kindle fire great add for the front a rear facing camera a well a the basic feature another add for this devise is the added storage option
i bought this for my year old birthday he love it not too fancy but get the job done for him
easy set up easy to use and great assistance to have it is like having the internet a your own personal butler
the easiest and lightest way to read a book any time and any place
i have been rockin one ipad or another since apple launched them in and never saw the need for a dedicated reading device like the kindle that said i picked one up on a whim during black friday and i finally understand what the fuss is about the text customization option make it easy to design find the perfect reading experience and the fact that i can send instapaper article to my kindle from all my other device is awesome the fact that the screen is lit from the edge a opposed to a backlight make it noticeably le draining on the eye only downside is the fact that amazon make you spend to get rid of those pesky special offer which force you to swipe the screen to dismiss them every time the device is turned on
tablet is great it is used for several hour a day and there is no problem with power just a the right size for it is purpose
good for travel easy to use and long battery power
this wa bought a a replacement to a shattered screen kindle we are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it wa to set up the replacement literally no strain on the brain follow screen instruction and everything from old kindle transferred over flawlessly awesome
took around and a half day for the you tube to start the video but it decent enough once it started you can never be sure when it is gonna work and when not
this wa a gift to my grandma and it is simple enough for her to use it and understand it

i gifted this product to my brother he liked it a lot better battery life and light to read in night is really useful

the tablet is great with many build in game the only disadvantage is not a lot of storage
bought two a gift for our daughter thought since they recently started to read book again and would buy the actual book or try to read them on their phone it would make a perfect gift they love to be able to download book from amazon and be able to use it a a tablet with ton of entertainment at their fingertip
this tablet is the best for kid switching from kid to adult is awesome work perfect and ha lot and lot of apps for kid
i use it for reading book and news it ha a great screen
my wife and i have enjoyed using alexa and look forward to it getting more apps to use

i have yet to figure out what page of the book i am on do not really care what percent of a book is left or that i have minute left in a chapter after using a nook for many year this is cumbersome good news way easier to get library book on this
amazon fire tablet gb ha been easy for me to learn how to use i like that i can read free book from the library it ha everything i wanted and is a nice size for holding
amazon kindle paperwhite is moe like reading a book page rather than reading on lcd screen
it wa a great gift for daughter in law she love it
the kindle fire hd is an impressive product it is faster than my samsung tablet i know i will enjoy using it i just wish that amazon prime music had a downloadable app for it
just the right size for e mail game and surfing fit in most purse or backpack love it
wa please to find out that a camera albeit not real high in pixel density but still usable wa now available along with a memory slot older model died and wa getting real slow due to not enough memory good for a book reader not so for a full featured tablet
great product for the price i m pleased with the kindle fire and would remmend this product to all age group
i bought this tablet to replace one i had different brand that wa worn out this is a pretty good tablet for the price i just wanted something to use til i uld get something bigger i have had no problem with it other than some of the game i played on my other one not being available on the fire
the fire tv work great bought it mainly for my kid to watch their show in their room without adding another cable box and wiring to my home i am an amazon prime member and the free ntent available is sufficient for all the kid regardless of age we re talking to year old the remote wa a little temperamental at first but ha been working fine after a regular software update
love my alexa so much best gadget ever very accurate cannot get enough of alexa love it so much i got the dot a well
great for small child allows for limited time setting also allows parent to set a requirement for how long educational apps must be used before free time case work well
this is the best entry level tablet for kid cheap and with the amazon free option you can give your kid what they like on your own term also nsider getting a protective case with it
awesome product and it ntrols my new sony led television i only wish i had waited to purchase my first one because of the amazing sale price on this one
i used to have a old version of kindle and this one is a great improvement the resolution is great and the backlight is especially nvenient
for her for christmas i m no dummy i did she love it
great tablet for my daughter and she love it so very much thanx again best buy
the echo is amazing i am able to ntrol the smart home device from a number of different platform also having the timer and alarm function make sure i am able to keep on schedule if needed
easy to use great traveling device make purchasing new book incredibly easy
really enjoying this little guy bought two for my mom and daughter
have now had for a month and i have to say the speed of this tablet is good really no lag on browsing only major downfall that some game might lag a bit but for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple it price will do
simply great and easy to set up i would remmend this to anybody
the nvenience is great good sound great value
work well with voice mmands i e music weather my sport team and shopping i have purchased two of these and no more cd is with my music
there is so much you can do with this it really is a must have for anyone who love tech
truly power fast amazon product are great love how the charger is made well sturdy and doe exactly what it say it will do
if you are solely looking for the best reading experience and not looking for tablet functionality the kindle paperwhite will serve your purpose very well besides providing a great reading experience with it dictionary wikipedia ace and xray function the in book search function work perfectly the glow light also work great and ha a very large range of brightness the text is very crisp and the battery life is excellent an excellent buy
great price great product great sound for such a small system
i seem to enjoy this in most catagories wa not sure about the tall and narrow screen layout at first with reading book but when placed side by side with old ereader no strain to learn new layout only thing not happy about is the lack of under case not wanting to spend and up for a unit i m sure that will change this is a real good product in a usually subpar price point i think this will be a game changer
very easy to set up and use seems to be good quality
we can watch movie and tv show in k great picture quality
this is my send tablet and it is a great starter tablet if you have a prime acunt it is even better the prime video allows you to download video for later viewing
i love my echo everyday there is a new skill or a new app that must have of any wait to see other major name start to integrate alexa into everyday life
unbelievably good value when i bought one at a disunted sale price but well worth the usual best buy price of usd simplicity itself particularly if you have used android previously although restricted to the amazon environment and app store i still found all the free apps i uld ever need and the tablet appears to be very reliable mpared to my aging nexus
anything i have time to watch i can see on this box cut cable bill in half
great for little kid the case on it is amazing my daughter love it only thing i would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger
i have two kindle fire tablet both the and version so i m rather familiar with them and how they work for my son is th birthday he asked for a new tablet he d been using leap pad for the past few year but wa also used to using one of mine when needed i debated back and forth between this version and the kid edition in the end i chose this one in having a kid profile set up on the kindle all auto pay turned off and being able to decide which apps i put onto his profile i felt this wa a better option the tablet is quick good size for his hand and ha enough memory for any of the apps and book i want to put on it for him we found an awesome case to protect it for the price i do not think you uld get any other tablet i am very happy with my choice and will likely ntinue to choose kindle product
the fire tv is a really nice box for streaming turn your tv viewing into a whole new experience
i bought this hoping to make good use of my k tv but realized that there is very little k ntent out there but at least i ll be ready then
everything wa a i expected and order it online and pick it up next day easy to do

i use my amazon fire tablet to allocate kid to watch tv through my twc app a well a to download and stream music if you are a heavy amazon user this app is perfect for you hold charge for a decent amount of time a well
really nice customer first service i have had other kindle reader before so wa familiar with the unit
great for everything when your hand are full and if you like to multitask
this is my third one they get better each time i love reading out door without the glare making it hard to see
i wa hesitant and unsure of the value of the echo but wa curious so i picked it up when it went on sale the device is amazing in that it can detect your voice and what you say even over background noise clearly play music and speak since then i find i use it for regular news and weather update to play music ntrol light and the temperature via ebee integration and i m just getting started there are thousand of skill that you can enable to customize the echo to do what you want
if you are going to be using this allot i remmend the fire tv over the stick it is much more responsive the fire stick tends to be a bit laggy when navigating and launching apps
work great but want you to buy subscription to get some music you may like just found out it support dish network
this tablet worked great for keeping in touch in with my wife is mother up north very easy to operate

great charger
i bought this for my husband who just turned and is not up to date on technology i thought it would be fun to have a direct line to knowledge with voice mmand
it is the best tablet i ever it ha the olest apps
this device is not a great a advertised it doe not do a many thing a expected and you have to go to a lot of trouble to do otherwise
this the best streaming device out there if your looking for a great and fast streaming device this it it for sure you cannot go wrong with it super fast and no buffering
we use this product to side load apps like kodi it work really well i have never experienced any freezing of any kind or any lag time like i have with other product

decent little tablet at the price wonbreak the budget if broken
even when iâ m outside in bright sunlight the word of the book iâ m reading are still crystal clear that alone make the kindle oasis worth what it st me the kindle oasis wake up in just sends and any book i choose instantly open ready to be read it is the perfect size and isnâheavy or bulky i really do read for hour at a time sometimes i pace the floor while i read sometimes iâ m on my elliptical machine when i read and sometimes iâ m sitting down no matter what iâ m doing the kindle oasis remains mfortable to hold and it is always easy on my eye when i receive a book that is in pdf most of the time i can enlarge the word if it wonâallow me to enlarge the word i can change the orientation of the page and the word are automatically larger i am able to make note on the book if needed and i can highlight word and or passage my merlot leather ver is attractive when i flip it open it is just like opening the ver of a book how to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page it say that it â dual battery charging system delivers month of battery life â this wa a huge thing for me instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day i would be able to read for month without charging the kindle is this how my oasis ha performed well not so much there are nditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two month first you have to limit your reading to thirty minute a day that one is impossible for me there are day that i am only able to read for thirty minute but they donâoccur very often my kindle go everywhere with me and i use just about every spare moment to read send the wireless need to be turned off that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember the only time the wireless need to be on is to download one or more book third this is based on your light setting at that is way too low for me i keep my light setting anywhere from to i donâlimit my reading to thirty minute a day and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off my light setting is kept anywhere from to and i put my kindle to sleep the send iâ m done reading so how long doe a single charge last me ten day is the longest a charge ha lasted me so far but it would have kept a charge for several more day if i had remembered to turn my wireless off once i succeed in keeping my wireless off i will let you know how long the charge last now i donâplug it in to charge a soon a the charge on the ver get low i allow my ver charge to go a low a it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the ver i allow it to drain down to about before i plug the ver and kindle into my mputer to charge the one thing that surprised me wa that everything on the oasis is in black and white for some reason i thought that maybe the book vers would appear in lor but since i bought the oasis to read book on lor isnâneeded special offer do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up they arenâa distraction and to be honest they are kind of fun to look at you can pay a higher price so they wonâappear on your kindle if you would rather not see them i asked myself some question once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldnâlast for month would i still have bought it yes i would have if i had known that everything would appear in black and white would i still have bought it yes i would have
my daughter love this tablet she cant keep her hand off it
love my tablet only thing i wish is that the charging rd wa longer
i didnt realize even though i should have that i uld not add whatever program i wanted to for it i wanted to get this so i uld play game on the tablet while home instead of my phone i wa able to install one of the two game i play but wa unable to with the send i will actually be returning it because that mean i have no use for it my wife ha one and hers ha been great for her this entire time

love it i am reading all the time now and i never used to read so much
i got of these tablet for my niece and nephew and from my understanding they have not put them done since they got them for christmas so that being said i believe they are a great tablet
this kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader like the screen quality but truthfully doe not like being pigeon holed by amazon for every book or story having to go through them for nearly everything greatly decline from the ease of use of the various function the need to find or put her existing library into amazon in order to use it on the kindle is ridiculous and annoying once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly
i am very pleased with amazon fire tv i see my film my child play game and watch channel
overall i am very pleased with my paperwhite small and mpact fit in my purse lightweight and easy to read with the backlight
my two year old love the video game and book this tablet provides
love the echo hand free just tell alexa what song you want to hear we have ours in the kitchen and call out song while oking and eating turn on light change the thermostat and even order a pizza to be delivered gotta have this gadget
best buck i have ever spent definitely remmend it
i ended up returning this tablet for the price the tablet performed very well however if you have the money do yourself a favor and step out of the amazon lineup the ipads are great in my opinion the best but they st from what i have experienced the samsung tab a line is a solid tablet for a budget you can often find one on sale for and it a pretty good bang for the buck if the money is your only ncern then this will probably work well enough for you
this kindle make reading even more enjoyable very light in the hand amazing back light very highly remmended
fabulous new functionality love the night reading capability
this is a smart buy wonderful for reading and watching movie perfect if you have amazon prime
i bought this about a month ago and i really like it the best part is light in weight sound is very good for small gathering like on the deck or camping and it me with batterey charger the voice mmand activation is so great to have and listen all my music plus worldwide radio from tunein
brought for my wife kid took it over now am going to purchase two more
excellent tablet i purchased for someone in a nursing home and she love it
mainly used for reading kindle book but tablet doe many other thing go with me everywhere i go
this ha been a great addition to our family haha the kid love it and for the price it cannot be beat maybe by the mini me version the echo dot
amazon fire tab is amazing entry level tab just go for it
i picked this up on black friday and ended up returning it the following week this may be greater for an e reader but cannot replace a tablet for email amazon shopping
i like the fact that there is parental ntrol plus by putting your child is age the kindle will only send you game that are designed for your child is age
other than not being voice activated like the echo it is just a good if not better
my year old love his tablet it is perfect for him
this is my send fire tablet so i knew that this product would do all i needed plus the newer version had some extra like a camera work great for me

it is great to be hand free just ask alexa to add to shopping list or play specific music nice sound no typing required love it

you can do a lot with these no pain in a smart tv when you can add one of these the box is nsiderably faster than the stick but the stick is the best value

easy device for my in law who are not tech savvy
get the job done a a tablet i guess apps are limited but this is not meant to be a full on tablet it a reader it doe freeze ad glitch a little but for the price i guess it worth it
i have had a uple different kindles have also tried to read book on my ipad phone love the kindle paperwhite you can read it outside in the sun by the pool on your deck etc the print is always clear visible the battery stay charged for several day it is small size make it easy to carry in your purse or tote bag
these are made for the echo and a i use my echo in a uple end of the house so it is nvenient to have the two of them
just a advertised stunning bright white hd font it is easier to read than an actual book my eye do not get fatigued
replaced my older lost during recent move version must admit this model is faster ha more storage and a camera love it
the echo doe everything it is advertised to do mine doe thing without a hitch that others have a problem with mine doe lighting through my alarm system in a few simple step work great
this tab is awesome easy to handle and carry anywhere because of it size the price also very reasonable
personally i d say buy the newer inch fire but you do get more for your money getting the older one
the picture awesome memory card can be installed
this is a great reader for child or adult student or just for pleasure it is small lightweight easy to transport it performed a expected based on the product description and review it met or exceeded my expectation i can use it at the pool at the beach in the house in low light situation i love my kindle paprewhite
most buyer will have a phone or other charger that will work so you probably do not need to buy this
work great and doe everything you want from a personal assistant i would defintly remend this product to someone who wish to have a personal assitant
i love this thing i am a bit of a bibliophile and obsolutely love book this is not to replace book but it make story more accessible it is easy to use ha great better life it is perfect

i love this device not sure how i have survived for so long without it this thing doe it all i would remmend this product for sure the sound is great ming out of this device
i replaced my old kindle a it took a power failure hit the new kindle ha been updated and it is easier to download the e book i am learning some of the new update but it appears to be more user friendly than my old one customer service for the kindle is available and they are very helpful you can get a review about any book before you purchase it no returning book to the library
a decent tablet just wish the app store had some better apps to download
setup went smoothly v roku that uld never detect wifi picture quality very good menu a little squirrelly and navigation selection uld be better but not awful only negative so far is that remote seems to devour aaa battery
we enjoy asking question listening to music need to learn more of the thing that it can do great voice regnition
i bought this when it wa on sale and my reward upon wa expiring so i felt i didnhave much to lose overall this tablet is a good value but you have to be careful about certain aspect the tablet is really fast for something in this price range the screen ha pretty good resolution a well there is no bluetooth connectivity so keyboard and wireless headphone wonwork with it the app store is the amazon app store i side loaded google play and am getting my apps from there youtube helpful for instruction the lock screen is an amazon billboard the default search is bing instead of google i have not figured out how to fix that yet i just use the google app to search google you can load the chromecast app from play but it is hit or miss a to whether it work it work for youtube and flixter but it doe not work for any disney apps watch espn watch abc etc you can cast the screen and view thing that way but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet is screen i think it wa a good deal since it wa cheap and i can now watch my prime movie on it still it is not the tablet you would expect from an android device my satisfaction would improve greatly if chromecast worked better
i would remmend it to all my family very happy with this item
read a lot about my product and would only purchase at best buy
gave this product to my nephew and they love it easy to carry and easy to use
i love it work great tried to purchase this kindle fire at christmas time it wa sold out but i keep going back to best buy and finally they were in stock so i bought one and now i m happy

it is my first time owing a kindle but so happy i purchase it all my favorite book in one place love the light and how practical it is
so far the amazon echo ha been great especially at the disunted price i m still trying thing with the echo and i also have the google home and so far i m giving the edge to the amazon echo a it look like they have a head start on feature

i bought the amazon echo a a gift to my niece both her and her family love it it wa easily linked to their wi fi and it wa also easily linked to their amazon acunts great gift
great tablet but apps limited mparison of other tablet
great value for surfing the net reading e mail etc
it work great a advertised i bought a micro sd card upgrade and that work too
great tablet for all age easy to navigate charge fast great resolution
the amazon echo is the missing link to the mplete smart home strategy a must get for anyone looking to unify their smart home device into a sensible and easy to use gadget
well worth the investment picture quality is on par with verizon fios purchased unit one used wirelessly the other via lan connection without a loop picture quality very similar highly remmended

i wa very pleased with this not only is it a great tablet but a great price
very well built enjoy reading on it and streaming video
bought this tablet to replace a year old galaxy tab this tablet is quick and easy to use relatively streamlined the screen is nice and the stereo speaker while tiny sound better than my old tablet the modified android system that amazon is running on this tablet is good just a bit restrictive all in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps pro price performance feel sturdy easy to navigate silk browser work greatns not all apps are supported on here like telegram ad on lock screen feel unnecessary but not a hindrance not a customizable a other android tab
we really like all that it doe it amazing device
while the design is a little industrial for my taste it doe blend into a room pretty well the home automation integration is nice too especially the integration with the logitech harmony remote i love being able to turn thing on and off with my voice another great feature is the music playback alexa ha a song for every occasion finally it is kinda fun to talk to my niece came over and talked to it for hour one day go figure give it a try
easy to use
got it for my grandmother and she love to play game on it
brought it for my niece for a christmas and she love it doe not lag or anything it work just fine
easy to download app set up pair perfectly with the philip hue
for the price this work fine a a reader i had the original fire and wa disappointed when it quit charging i m hoping that i do not have the same problem with this
this is an ok tablet for the price doe is able to do a lot of thing like a more expensive tablet but i find it to be slow i bought it mainly a a reader so am not to ncerned about the other apps etc is handy to carry in a purse for reading on the go i have hooked it up to public wifi and seems to work ok did not do much a do not know if any security there
took some getting use to but finally got it set up and love it
i bought this after i bought my firestick and this is faster work great with netflix easy to install and load picture quality is fantastic
it work not a user friendly a roku not a many apps a roku no google play store
great way to increase your music library without buying cd
it a great ereader but a little pricy it ha the same spec a the voyage a far a pixel and procesor which sts le the only difference between this and the voyage is that it is much lighter it is brighter led and a longer battery life if you re using the ver i have noticed the battery life drain much faster without the ver but you ll still be able to read for hour without it you would think it be water resistant hence the name but it is not but then i do not plan on reading when it is raining or outside or while taking a bath overall it is the best ereader amazon currently ha to offer but if you do not mind the price tag and want the best then go for it voyage is still not a bad option though
i had a nook for several year but did not get good service from barnesand noble so i switched to the amazon kindle and i am sooooo happy
parent really like it for a bluetooth speaker and informational guide in their small ndo great buy
we brought this a a replacement for the fifteen to fifty book my daughter wanted to take with her to hawaii book of urse would weigh a lot and there be no room for cloth pesky airline and their poundage issue now she cannotake a hundred book and she ha a mini mputer it is a win win but no win for the airline
i love the kindle paperwhite it is thin and light weight it is easy on my eye easy to throw in my purse when i m heading out
we love our new echo strong sound quality weather update alarm internet detail and easy to use
best then siri this is my rd purchase got a dot and a tap a well and they all working inside the same house in different room
i own a a previous model of the kindle and like that i thought it uld not get any better them i found this it touch screen and it light up so you literally can read it anytime in the light in the dark i use it everyday
i used it a a gift in an office holiday secret santa
i have this and the dot very little difference between the two other than size maybe it play music a little louder thanks to bigger speaker but if this wa not on sale i would have stuck with the echo dot star because of the functionality of alexa product in general
i bought two tablet for you little one and they love them i would remmend
i bought this a a gift for myself and i love it
i bought this product for my year old niece she wa extremely happy with it especially the camera feature it is durable and easy to carry around great product
this is exactly what the person wanted a a gift and she enjoys using it
i bought this for my son and one for my son in law they are mesmerized by all that the echo is capable of doing i want one
have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful product feature are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere
firetv box is a lot better than the firestick awesome device just had an issue with one firestick freezing up a lot but wa easily returned when i brought it back to the store no verification wa needed and they exchanged it for a new one i use them to have kodi on them and i have a total of in different room they do freeze up sometimes when running a big build or a big app on them which get annoying then i use the firetv which is better and can handle more than the stick can
fire tablet is a cheap one but good enough for my porpose actually you get much more than what you pay is an excellent retribution for your money
i picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy i have a few family member that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them the new product i got wa very disappointing the display had a dead pixel on it when i turned it on the product is very slow and the camera leave a lot to be desired i took it back and exchanged for an ipad mini and am very happy with it
serf the purpose well specially if one ha an older non smart tv however there is always additional expense because most of the feature you have to subscribe to and pay for
very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great
i really enjoy my e reader it is light and easy to use
great great great great great great great great tablet
this product is really awesome for kid to play in all sort we can use a strong case and let kid play in it
very easy to install and use great for testing whole family the remote is easy to use and very easy to memorize
this is a good beginning tablet work well and ha lot of preloaded apps to start you off
this is a simple ereader that look great in any light highly remmended
really great and very clear and good reading just great
can not print from this device using the touch screen is very difficult
i like this thing i have it turning on light in and out of the house it good for getting info about thing it can do math it can hear very good and will play music from my pandora acunt that is just a few thing it can do
bought one of these two week before on amazon and paid almost double for what best buy had these for so i bought another one the same day a this
i have an ipad that i read book on unfortunately it is horrible to read on the beach park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight the kindle paperwhite is perfect for that
purchased this tv a a birthday present and it didndisappoint she absolutely love it raf about it all the time great sound display and wa easy to mount
great product and superior technology we use it every day
the extra money for the voyage version is well worth it a the screen is brighter clearer and easier on the eye the other spec are also nicer mpared to other kindle version but the screen is what sold me
i can move my firetv from set to set and room to room with no problem it work great for my need
awesome device for home automation great for quick info query i added smart outlet very easily
improved feature and design crystal clear high resolution screen and amazing battery life make this not only a must own amazon device but a a dedicated e reader easy to use for all age group
great product and excellent battery life the backlight is an added bonus that i didnknow i need or wanted until i had
if you need help making a decision in what product to buy then hope i can quickly help you make that decision this is a great product for of u out there if you have a k tv then get the version of the fire tv if you have to decide between a firestick or a fire tv then get the fire tv the processor speed difference alone is worth the price difference if you want the best out there then the nvidia shield tv is for you either way amazon made a great product in the fire tv some key feature are the microsd expansion ability to use a ntroller for some mild gaming and voice activated remote get prime and have access to all of amazon is video and music streamin service
easy to use and just the right size love the ease of operating the device small enough to carry around still access all my favorite
i love love love this tablet my old hp tablet finally quit working and check around what would serve my need and this wa it
work well with no problem and i am happy with my purchase
my wife loved her gift i made the right purchase
ha a very good bluetooth speaker sound quality is good but otherwise she is pretty useless when it me to get answering question
my granddaughter loved it she used it for her school work
ordering this online to pick up at the store wa easy until i got to the store where a usual there were worker standing around yet i had to wait several minute for someone to address me at the pickup desk then i had to wait to pay for it at the register i would have thought i uld purchase it at the pickup center honestly if it were notfor the increased risk of stolen delivery item during the christmas season i probably would have gone with amazon to purchase the kindle the price wa the same through both retailer
this wa not a necessary product for my family but we sure are having fun with it at first i think my year old thought we were talking through a microphone to a real person he understands now that alexa is not real but he sure ha fun asking question and making request overall alexa is really good at answering and my whole family enjoys having her around hopefully there is not someone listening to everything that go on in my house
it a good tablet for my year old daughter there are parental ntrols and it can access the web
it is very durable and nice picture it the perfect size for my year old
it is nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it is just too small
these are the best you can get i have bought already
you cannot got wrong with a tablet for le than capable of watching movie and play game perfect for kid

bought alexa a kind of a novelty gift and it ended up being pretty ol we have not even tapped into all of the thing it can do but it give you the weather news etc and with the addition of amazon music will play virtually any song you ask the speaker is adequate for music etc she alexa doe not know everything but neither doe siri wife and kid love it and although a little on the pricey side is a lot of fun
needed something smaller than my samsung inch tablet to carry around and this worked great
so i got this for my nephew mostly for book for school and game but he tends to get anoid with it cause the internet connection that it pick up doe not stay but other than that great
very good product exactly what i wanted and a very good price
i do like the fire tablet but i feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera the internet work but i find it take a while to load i have read a book on it but i prefer to use my original paper white that can be read in any lighting including outside but for what it is and the price it wa it a good product
unit ha fast response time graphic are very clear
i m returning it because a new version is ming i
the fire replaces my kindle reader and serf this purpose well when using a a tablet with wifi on battery run down very quickly but oh well just need to charge often really like the camera not the greatest pic but again serf my purpose well
great item and great price use it mainly for book but good enough for basic internet activity
i purchased two for my grandchild to share and they are so happy with them which make me really happy i need to buy head phone next
the fire work fine it is not the fastest but for basic browsing and watching video it work great you cannot beat it for the price great for kid and not having to worry about them breaking it

item wa doa reached out to amazon it who this happens often i stand gratification wa thrown straight out the window i returned the item to bb where i purchased the appel tv much better product and work which is more than i can say for the fire tv i give the item a star instead of a because amazon it wa quick to answer the phone and troubleshoot

awesome great value good quality product i would remmend this to anyone
if this is your first tablet i would remmend it if you have ever had an ipad and would stick with the ipad and pay the extra money even for an older one you get what you pay for
bought it to see if there wa any difference between it and the fire stick there wa not will probably place it in the guest bedroom since i really do not have a need for it

what i read about it looked like a great gift for my grnaddaughter
love it make reading a pleasure easy on eye able to take anywhere simple to use
our echo is fun the only problem is that alexa seems to turn herself off and wonrespond otherwise love the music
the amazon echo began a basically a speaker for music i waited until it started getting more and more feature and skill before i bought it but i m glad i did i actually bought echo dot first mainly for the home automation skill but then decided to get the big echo to leave in the kitchen to use with both skill and to listen to music it work great and the speaker is of decent quality
my granddaughter really like it she found age appropriate game to play
this device is so ol i must buy for all gadget guy
store employee were very helpful they had enough knowledge to help me select a great tablet
purchased this to get a lighter tablet also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery this is all around lighter thinner and easier to handle hd is a good upgrade and cannot beat the price for mparable tablet with same feature my wife read on it daily and love it i am probably going to search for another one we have the and i would like to try a if it were available i like to try different size device to see how i adjust same way with today phone
i originally purchased the google home a a gift for my husband he quickly wa frustrated with google home a it didnrespond to what he wa a asking the echo is much better equipped to answer question and follow mmands than it mpetitors
for the money a great android like tablet that work
nice tab and worth for it money got this from best buy during thanks giving and gifted to my friend
the size is nice it is light weight no glare when outside in the day great for night reading too
this tablet is the best buy i uld buy i paided dollar for a brand new kindle fire awesome
found this tablet to be user friendly and easy to handle this wa purchased for and elderly individual who is enjoying it very much battery life is not long enough though
i bought amazon kid is fire tablet for my two grandson for christmas included in the purchase of the a k f tablet is a one year subscription to kid is free time i have called emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate begin using the free one year subscription of kid is free time still no resolution upon trying to register tablet credit card used to purchase is required i do not understand why my credit card need to be submitted in order to obtain activate a service that is included in the already prepaid purchase i have been waiting for a response since christmas therefore at this time i would have to give a star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product with hope of getting this issue resolved i would still remmend to a friend
love that the memory is expandable the kid are going to love it
this is a great tablet for the money the only thing i would like to see is a longer battery life otherwise it is perfect
great item if my hand are tied up i can ask alexa about the weather or sport even song with out the touch of a button
bought fire tablet on impulse and not sorry like much better than my samsung galaxy tab felt g wa enough storage space since they have now added external storage space
it wa easy to set up my grandson ha enjoyed the broad selection of activity from which to choose
it work great the first time and just bought my nd for a different location the rd is that much closer to being cut
this item ha a very nice readout and is well built a far a i cannotell the overall size is very suitable and the price wa reasonable i get great service at best buy every time i shop there
i am a big fan of e reader i prefer the e ink screen over tablet screen when reading book i decided to pick up the new kindle voyage here are my thought first the kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the paperwhite model it is very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired sendly the addition of the page turn button is a welmed addition the button make it so easy to hold the kindle with one hand and turn page lastly the screen i marked off a star because i had to return my first voyage directly to amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that wa very distracting while reading the replacement kindle voyage that i received had a perfect screen and the ppi look amazing that being said amazon need to really focus on quality ntrol because i have read that the yellow tint on the screen is a mmon issue if you re spending for an e reader then the screen should be perfect especially since this is the rd generation of the lighted screen for the e reader if you re an avid reader then the kindle voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make if you re a casual reader who ha a paperwhite you re probably okay with what you have
love my firetv box who need cable even better then the stick
like being able to read outside and easier to take with me when traveling than a book is
i like the way parent ntrol what thier child and what program they see or use
i bought this for my year old twin and they love it it is very easy for them to use with kid free time
this is helpful if you read for more than minute i have personally noticed that after hr reading i have no headache or strain in my eye also battery life is unlimited charge it once for a uple of hour and your are good to go for week of extensive reading
the device is very useful and entertaining but if you doe not interact with the internet like siri what you see in the mmercial is what you get
this is my first android tablet it work pretty good though do not expect it to work like an ipad the ad are extremely annoying but that is not best buy is fault
amazon fir is absolutely the best for streaming movie
this paperwhite ha a sharp display ppi and adjustable brightness level it is extremely easy to hold when reading included in the box wa the paperwhite device a usb rd and quick start guide no power adapter wa supplied but i use the one for my cellphone and it work fine one charge hold me for about week the ad are not a intrusive a i thought they would be however i am displeased with the quality of the special offer i have found better offer just by searching the web also you cannot listen to audible book on this device it is reading only but that doe not bother me overall this is an excellent device since purchasing this i have quadrupled the number of book that i read in a month is time i highly remmend it to any avid reader
very easy to set up and use work great on my non smart tv
currently this is the fifth version of the kindle fire that i purchased since they came out purchased this one due to it ability to maximize storage with a sd card unlike the other one i have it seemed to not run a smooth a my kindle fire hdx once i started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since i use other tablet for that this wa mainly purchased to download show and movie from amazon prime to watch offline
awesome love it it wa delivered very fast would remmend
i love my tablet no regret the pic are great i remmend it
love it i use it for weather pandora you can play game and ask it recipe it is great
no matter if full priced or on sale this tablet is definitely worth it pop a microsd card in and do not look back paired with a prime membership you will be able to read shop watch all that amazon ha to offer i purchased a uple more a gift after using this for a uple of week
it is a great ereader and the font is much clearer than that of the paperwhite but that may not be enough to justify the extra the page turn button are a great addition too would be good if amazon would add audiobook capability though
for those who truly just want an ereader the kindle get the job done no glare easy to use
but wifi is not working great i have love amazon kindles since my first one replaced it with a fire hd then got fire multiple one problem is the last work with wifi for a while then start having problem reset wireless modem worked for a while then hard reset did now wonwork for wifi at all will keep trying though
i wanted a small tablet to read news and watch video i have amazon prime so i figured why not it is really cheap well i believe you get what you pay for this fire tablet froze on me when i only had one thing open i am very disappointed it also is very slow when you rotate the screen ugh i will be returning it
this is the best tablet on the market for a really great price and even ha alexa access
great product the entire family love it i would remmend buying it
great for family especially my kid alexa ha been keeping them busy engaging them by answering unending question playing music educational insight history geographical science math in addition we are now almost always playing our christian worship music on the echo hand down the echo ha beme the greatest addition to our family among all gadget
bought it on black friday sale use it a a odb reader for car and reading book every once in a while for there is nothing wrong with it
backlight feature is great for reading on an airplane when overhead light are too bright
i like this tablet it is very low maintenance and is easy

i bought this for my grandson for his th birthday present it is easy to set up and seems to be very durable
uld not download apps i needed to ntrol my tv

this wa a gift for my year old i am so happy with my purchase this try to keep some busy so i can now catch up with doing the thing i loved
very easy to use purchased it watch amazon video and to use my playstation vue acunt work well with both
before you nclude it doe not have enough look at what it can do and read the spec

we love this option for home movie easy to set up and very user friendly
i love it loaded lot of thing for my self and kid the price wa also great even my kind can use it easily i have remmended it to many of my friend and family enjoying it to the fullest i use over wifi and with my internet a well
i do most of my thing on my laptop but i wanted something to use while watching tv and so on i saw this tablet and had to look twice because i thought maybe it wa just a reader i have used this installing apps playing game reading texting on a free text app facebooking and so on the apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well the clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range the tablet feel of good quality it is not flimsy and cheap feeling we bought two and are extremely happy the trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet love it for what it is
unbelievable sound from a single source now i can simply say what music i want the volumne and timer are a great feature she read to me and answer most question she even tell worse joke than me this ha enhanced my bleek life i cannoturn on light and tv when i uld not before it give me freedom over my environment
great value for the price not a user friendly a the original kindle fire but still a good starter tablet for those that are le tech savvy
i bought this to mpliment the sharp k i had brought from best buy about two month ago we the k ntent doe not show up you have to search for it on netflix and amazon video once you find it however it is beautiful
great tablet for kid my boy love their tablet
the echo is fun and practical alexia is a joy to talk to and ask question the speaker in the unit ha great sound quality the possibility are limitless
after toying with purchasing an echo for month we finally pulled the trigger it wa well worth it from recipe to simplifying a shopping list to music and news it is a perfect supplement to our connected home alexa is much sharper than siri highly remmended
very inexpensive good size and weight to carry added a gb memory card and i have everything i need from book to video
obviously this is not the best tablet in it class but it a great value for the price
this tablet is a great value for the price point great functionality and value
if you are up in the air between the two fire stick and fire tv go with the tv due to the speed alone the memory is also nice but you will have a more enjoyable experience with the fire tv i have them both in my house but prefer the fire tv
tap make a great mobile alexa device not a loud a echo but still louder than the dot voice enabled alexa work but doe not detect voice a easy a the echo or dot a a mobile bluetooth speaker though it work fine
main reason for getting the amazon tv wa for better streaming experience of playstation vue the amazon fire tv handle vue streaming w o issue and the interface is very easy and user friendly i also like the ability to root the device for third party apps
i bought this to put in my room to use with prime music work great alexa is way smarter than siri with the alexa app or another echo device you can drop in and use a interm
great device for the family can play music from various source the voice regnition system is great you can ntrol smart device on your network with the echo
very kid friendly especially for toddler and easy to use
i saw this and wanted it right away it work good and help me it also keep me mpany i would remend it to anyone out there
work great easy to get connected and running have not had any issue with buffering
we bought this for my mother in law for mother is day she is not very tech but she is had no problem using
loooovvvvveeee it
doe what i need
this tablet wa for my daughter birthday and so far it is holding up well she love it and it doe what it wa meant ro do the only drawback is the the screen doe not get bright like your iphone or samsung tablet
the kindle fire is a very nice reader i love how small and light it is
much better then our old nook reader in every fashion
this little black box is awesome so easy to setup and use the choice of entertainment are outstanding
i love using it to read have all my book loaded and ready for when i travel
really enjoy the sound quality like that you can do voice mmands from anywhere in the house
i highly remmend this tablet it is very affordable
i bought this main to give me ntrol of my echo in the bedroom work flawlessly love being able to turn off all light in the house with a simple voice mmand before bed alexa all light off
you pay for the best and you get the best thank you best buy for providing this product
bought this for a bedroom tv the interface is geared toward amazon prime member so most of the item on the main screen are of no use to me you must do some scrolling to get to the apps page so for people who are not prime member it is not a nvenient a other streaming device my solution wa to install firestarter i would have bought a roku but amazon fire is the only streaming device to support the tivo app so unless i wanted to spend quite a bit more for a tivo mini roku this wa my only choice but after installing firestarter i m satisfied the tivo app doe not do everything a tivo mini doe it just allows u to watch rerdings from our tivo bolt in the living room had it me stock with a display option to switch to a le prime specific startup screen i would have given it star but amazon is trying to promote prime so that is not going to happen
my niece love this tablet she will not put it down
my year old grandson enjoys playing with his tablet i say playing because he think most of the program on it are game that he can play at some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the game he is also learning he enjoys it a lot
the best android based set top box for it is price amazon outdid themselves here with their fire tv line they got it right and they do not appear to be abandoning this anytime soon so hop on now while it is still hot
i have the stick also much better than the stick one
this wa on my wife is christmas list she love it easy to use
this is easily the best medium player around solid hardware blazing fast and snappy nice user interface and a ton of apps highly remmend
the individual seemed to enjoy the echo i will say i do like playing music from it good speaker
great for nighttime easy to read at the beach too
i bought my fire hd a an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbook for llege the fact that i saved well over on one of the book i had to get this semester wa a godsend most all undergraduate ur i have seen are offered in ebook form for kindle if you do not care about having the nstant ability of being on the internet without wifi or other hotspot it is a great resource pro price for this wa still le than the money saved for my biology book a lot le weight that llege textbook so far all book i need for llege are available a ebooks through amazon a single charge can make it through an hour school day n if you want need a network connection you have to use your phone a a hotspot or connect to another wifi network bottom line i wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over in book around i came out at well under nsidering i bought this
fire tv is just what it say i found that this streaming player eliminated any buffering issue i had i also enjoyed the voice activation feature and it is accuracy in regnition save yourself some time and just buy it now
easy to use lightweight can easily read in low light night
the echo work well ha good sound and is an interesting ncept where it fall short is in the quality of the search result it often responds that it doe not understand the question or doe not have information about what is asked i have returned and will purchase the google home system when it is released
good for a starter tablet for the kid love the parental ntrol option
purchased this table for my five year old daughter and she love it placed parental ntrols on the tablet so she cannot make purchase or search the web very easy to use and ha great apps may get one myself
this is good for the price battery is good quality of picture is ok
i bought it to use outside to read my ipad and android are bad in the sun this i can actually read in the sun happy
nice little tablet with great feature bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book she also love the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the light on
we have spotty radio reception so going through the internet is ideal i uld have done the same thing with a speaker for about the same price however this is more versatile a i can send message to others and make list plus more feature are being added all the time
i really like this tablet i would have given star but sometimes you have to push start several time after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying
even better than the paperwhite which have used regularly over the past uple of year
i purchased he fire because you can do more with it i have an apple tv nd gen and i enjoyed it but wa looking for something a little faster so far it is been great being able to side load other apps ha been great and the amazon prime ntent is pretty good
bought it for christmas the picture is great and memory is plenty
i love the amazon fire easy to use just plug and play
this is great wish i had more instruction on what she can do
what a great new ffiend very responsive have alexa handling all my home automation now too great add
i purchased this a a after thought the tablet ha gb but from the moment you start to use it almost five is already used by amazon i wa totally disappointed i love how the screen saver changed though it wa so clear and unique but the memory took the cake for me
this kindle is lightweight and a great travel break and extra free time mpanion you can read it anywhere love it
perfect size easy to read my favorite book on the go

bought of these for my kid to have something to play with and watch movie on while traveling bought a uple kid proof case online and they are good to go well worth the cheap black friday price
from the time when the kindles came out i wa not so sure on how well they would work well this one is a good mpanion for student and to keep you entertained
very good for my year old boy who like to play game
flashed cm run great run all the regular android apps and got rid of the amazon skin
this is my third kindle send fire i use it nstantly primarily for reading electronic book currently have over book in kindle library like it best when traveling a i do not have to carry a bunch of hardback book with me anywhere i go where i know there will be a waiting line haircut doctor is or dentist is office i have it with me and use it productively to read
i have purchased the cheaper tablet they never last i purchased this for my brother who is never in one place long he is able to stay connected and enjoys carrying this tablet everywhere
great device travel well easy to navigate would remmend
the tablet work great for the price it cannot be beat for those ncerned about the limiting of apps to amazon marketplace there is a downloadable hack that will install google apps just look it up on youtube and you are all set
i thought this would just be a fun novelty but it is not set up wa a snap and i located it centrally in our home via wifi no problem at all and it worked the first time i have a kindle fire tablet and that doe help a bit in management once set up i then added skill and even used iftt so now i have a flash briefing with news i am interested in my wemo light are ntrolled by voice a well a wemo app i listen to my music i get the weather information my family listens to joke and much more
my wife wanted a backlight with her kindle in addition to other feature even if not on sale this is a great buy for anyone who enjoys reading
very easy to setup up and can be used to automate home using smart skill i use to ntrol hue lighting and nest product only mplaint is she is not a smart a they say nstant update are making her better but lacking a lot of information when asked email are sent with update info percent on voice mmands wish it came with optional remote for when you are out of range of voice
easy to use and download book i like carrying many book with me in this tidy little package
my husband wanted the fire box and we are glad we got it

the light is adjustable and easy on the eye a great way to read without disturbing your partner
this is the send one we have purchased and we really enjoy it
i found the tablet easy to useit ha a longer battery life than most and the memory can be increased with an sd card you can use the google app if you do not like using amazon
great size fast for the price you cannot go wrong
i purchased it for my kid and she liked it if you do not want to spend much on tablet for kid it is the best product available in the market
love having the wireless tap to use anywhere it is small sound is good charge up quickly bough the sling to protect it outside
great mini tablet clear video excellent reading very easy to learn
the kindle fire ha ton of space for all your book and is easy to operate and understand i bought it for my husband who cannot operate a basic mputer but ha caught on very well to the kindle
working great and i love it it is ha a great quality good graphic and easy to use
absolutely love my new kindle voyager lightweight and mpact size make it easier to carry with me everywhere i go wish i had bought one sooner
i never expected this small device uld have so many feature it good but you need to buy a memory extension
i bought this for my father for christmas he ha a smartphone but the screen is getting a little too smail for him to read so i thought i smaller tablet might be nice i wa right he absolutely love his kindle
i needed something for a young kid and this tablet wa suggested to me from a sale person at best buy the kid love it

we decided to buy the tablet so our toddler uld play educational game on hers instead of going for my ipad i love how we can block her from going on the internet a well a set a curfew it is easy to use and my daughter love it
there is a lot of growing functionality with this product i have a philip hue setup in my home and it is nice to just ask for a certain lamp or set of lamp to turn on off dim or brighten save me a trip to the lightswitch the bluetooth speaker functionality seems spotty a i have it connecting to my pc and it will arbitrarily disnnect whereas other bluetooth speaker within about the same radius will connect and stay on aside from that it is rather like having your phone handy and nstantly listening to you so you need not pull it out and ask for your appointment or make them and other thing you might be used to doing with the google voice feature or siri
buy one you will love it i turned off cable and have one on all my tv
love the lack of bell and whistle stuck in airport battery last forever
easy to set up and start using love having any type of music at the prompt of my voice
decent tabletperforms ok you really get what you pay fordo not expect anything special with this tablet it work doe what it meant to do and nothing more having a prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet it pretty much an amazon portal for all the service they offer great for my son streaming his show like sesame street pb etc netflix work fine a well
i love my alexa you can ask this thing anything and it will get you an answer
the kindle fire is great i bought one for my husband when the old kindle quite working then i bought one for my daughter to replace the ipod she lost she love it i love that you can add extra storage with a mini sd card something you cannot do on apple device

i feel like i have been mpletely lied to about this device despite review claiming a hand free mode that doe not exist in the setting i just downloaded the app for the first time today and there is no hand free option to enable in setting and pandora said it is not available in the u on this amazon tap thanks for ruining a birthday amazon
i bought it for my year old who like to read now she love to read her mother and i are very happy a one uld imagine the kindle work great and we love the backlit touch screen

i wa looking for just a bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound when i first listened to amazon tap i wa so impressed with the sound quality then add in all the feature it wa a no brainer for a purchase sound quality is off the chart alexa learns more every day and so do i if you are a prime member this is a must if you are not then you really should be
i m pleased with my tablet and service received at your store
i have been using a kindle forever and when it became apparent i needed an android device i have a window phone which i love but ha serious app limitation i thought i with a fire i uld get a tablet and upgrade my kindle at the same time but even with geek squad help i uld never figure out how to upload the apps i needed onto the fire so back it went replaced with a lenovo tablet that doe the trick
i used to nstantly look at my phone to check the weather and simple thing now i can just ask echo
love the kindle product and the paper white is easy to read in daylight low light and no light
send kindle i use it for reading game internet and shopping
after using my son is echo i just had to have one we now purchased a dot and a bluetooth speaker for the wife to use in her bathroom for getting ready each morning and she also just love it it can do so many more thing than we first thought great addition to our home
easy to use not overpriced you get what you pay for
doe what it is supposed to do on the spot hand free entertainment system
this device play on the fact that you must subscribe to their stuff or this is just a empty cylinder that tell you the weather and that is it and even then there is a subscription required for everything google home at least play general music list and a number of other key action
this tablet wa a gift for my office is white elephant exchange also bought one for my boyfriend great inexpensive tablet for amazon centric people
the echo is great for music weather and anything else you have integrated in the house
if you re willing to experiment this uld be really awesome
it is nice really nice go buy one for your grandma she will give you a real big hug
my husband is previous tablet died a sudden death so i gave it back and bought this fire the sound volume and quality is much better
best thing ever since i bought the fire stick i hardly watch regular tv we are thinking about cutting off our cable to save money because the fire stick give u every show movie we need from regular cable
i wa so excited to get this ol new tech toy in my home that would make it easy for me to enjoy the music of my choice i never gave a thought to all alexa would do for me first of all the set up wa like once the app wa downloaded it wa a piece of cake alexa is like my personal assistant she make appts shopping list wake me up on time find the recipe i m looking for and so much more all i have to do is ask i cannot wait to get the adapter to make my home into a smart home
this is what e reader should be like page turning is quick the backlight is amazing reading in bed at night is perfect with this i take it with me everywhere
alexa is awesome with practice she will keep you on the uch asking her to do all the work she is easy to setup understands sentence and really love how she can find any song you want using amazon music
i wanted to avoid the excessive blue light created by i pad phone and other lor electronic device this let me read right up till bedtime with no problem
fast and easy to use interface is user friendly even my kid had no issue using this device no lag for me connected wired and seems way faster than the stick definitely remmend this item

best tablet for my year old son it ha helped a lot and seems to be the most simple kid tablet system available
i love all of my amazon product and this one is no different great quality and clear picture
the paperwhite make it possible to ndense a lot of book in one small device thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse you can pack a lot of book into your suitcase with a paperwhite if your device get stolen lost or trashed you may lose a substantial portion or all of your personal library the paper white allows you to increase size of print big advantage use of hand gesture to turn page allows faster reading it is awkward to hold lying in bed an attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time
i bought this for my eight year old child i didnwant to spend a ton of money so for what i paid it wa worth the money

ton of thing you can do with this highly remmend it
i recently decided to be a rd cutter and not have cable anymore just internet i currently have a samsung smart k uhd and the samsung k blu ray player and a pc that i use to access all my online ntent i decided to try the amazon fire tv and disvered that i already have access to just about everything the amazon fire tv ha through mny tv blu ray player and pc this is a great device but for me it wa just redundant
my wife u this to read various newspaper there is a problem occasionally with downloading the current issue it is not a problem every day just ever once in a while pleased with the device
use for entertainment only it work great best option for those that do not want to spend so much for an i pad
very satisfied with this product for month i have been using both my phone and laptop for reading book not too bad but the battery nsumption is a deal breaker on phone and laptop with this reader you get week of battery life and the display it look just like a page from a book very easy on the eye i have about pdf book on my paperwhite also pick up the paperwhite case very nice to keep your device protected
echo is a great device to have if you need an answer to a question or need the weather report etc one of the best u i have found so far is the creation of a shopping list a you think of item for a shopping list just tell alexa and she will add it to your list which you can recall later just before going to store it is fun to ask alexa trivia question or use her for other fun tidbit of information

the tap is a great product access to alexa in a grab and go format
i really like the amazon fire tablet because it is easy to navigate the size of the screen is good and the weight of the product is not too heavy i purchased the first one for my husband a uple of year ago but he broke it and i decided that it would be a great christmas gift for him since he really enjoyed the first one because i really like the product i have remmended it to several people who have purchased one
i m enjoy having alexia around shes my dj median and news caster all in one
this tablet is a good choice for little kid it is not very expensive and provide nice feature for the price you can beat this
this is a reliable brand and a good product for price
very hard to setup but once thats done it work remarkably well
work good easy for my kid but wish the regular android apps all worked
easy set up k ready great picture and wifi connectivity
well worth the buck especially if you are an amazon prime member you can download and watch anything on there for free including movie and magazine the screen is a bit on the darker side but the battery life is great i have both an ipad and this and i use both great when you are waiting for your ipad to recharge
if your not sure of what your need are the fire is a good place to start
i m very happy with my kindle fire beyond being able to read book it doe all sort of thing and is able to download a huge variety of apps it also hold a charge very long the size is perfect and portable yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone which i love i would definitely remmend this tablet to others
my sister in law needed a new tablet so the amazon wa a good choice i also got one for my mom and dad
bought for mother in law to play game on pretty simple to set up looked at other off brand tablet but the price on this wa good so we went with it seems to enjoy it only got a call from her for how to connect to the internet so i take that a a good sign since she is not tech savvy
great plug in to charge my device
best gift for beginers le price and enough speed and memory kid like it a lot
this wa disunted on best buy better than amazon it is a great device and even better off
like siri lot of fun and a decent speaker though wish it were easier to get auidobooks and music on it etc doe not always get what you were looking for but still try to get something close to it give helpful overview and recap of news and weather

my niece is year old and she absolutely love this tablet it is easy for her to use and navigate through plus it ha parental ntrols which i love definitely remmend it
great tablet for beginner at a great price point take a little to get used to the amazon operating system make sure you get a memory card with this a you have limited internal memory
fast up to window open without problemscamera not very good pic me out blurry
to be honest i think the fire tv is a way better investment than apple tv highly remmended
i bout this item for my granddaughter for christmas it ha game that she enjoys playing the case protects the device very well it also can be set up for age appropriate game etc a she get older you can change that it is bigger than an ipod and smaller than an ipad and ha a better price since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps
too many advertising and too many page to sort through
i can read book listen to book go on facebook shop search the web almost anything on my brand new kindle fire
this tablet is great unfortunately got a defective one at first but best buy wa happy to exchange it for u and had no problem doing it i m sure it wa only defective due to the hundred of people who were there on black friday shopping work great very satisfied

do you spend lot of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered item directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week
i brought it to have an extra table around the house for my daughter and it didndisappoint
this kindle is a great product i really enjoy it
i had an original version of these year ago i never used it then but have been reading more lately i figured it wa cheap enough let give it a go it ha been amazing i live in hawaii so i bring it to the beach and read nstantly the back light it perfect for night reading the only weird thing about this is that it save all of your highlighted area in one document but it give the full citation for each underlined part which make it extremely useful if you read different book but unnecessarily tedious but either way great feature
wife is favorite of all the kindles she sold her fire
the main reason i m not giving it star is because it is no ipad it will be great for kid mostly the screen quality is not the best

i like the shape and size of this kindle and the graphic are good but if i play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly it is very good for book and for music i would remmend it for those category
i have been a kindle fire user for year this new one is amazing i like being able to store information on a sd card

fire tv is the best way to cut the rd with the cable mpany we have fire stick already but the tv is much better

this is not an upgrade by any mean my three year old kindle outperformed oasis battery life better than a week with the light on lowest setting magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak two piece to keep up with unsnaps nstantly amazon customer service promise it will resolved in an update
it doe everything that much more expensive product do but it is much much slower when changing apps once using the app the very slow speed is no longer an issue
easy to use you just plug it in the outlet anyone can figure it out

i bought it for my daughter is birthday and she love it
i bought this one for my wife she love it i highly remmend this kindle reader
the reason people give it star is because they do not give the product enough time before they review it i purchased this along with my kindle dx on august i can honestly say that i do not remmend this product a it will damage the kindle the hinge that attache to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic ver and soon you will see it crack to avoid this you have to make sure the kindle doe not rock back and forth from off the back ver causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further this is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many time a day or simply lend it to someone else who doe not know better one thing i can honestly say is that i really wanted to like this product i really wanted it to work i m looking for a slip ver now
fast interface great for people with prime membership voice search working well it would have been nicer if the menu is flexible we can see third party apps along with the apps installed from amazon store
this is my rd kindle i have ntinued to move up on the screen size and this one is so easy to see and read i do however sometimes have a problem with it when i am online it cannotake forever to load up a site and move from page to page so that can be annoying i have extremely fast internet so that is not the problem and when i check strength of wifi connection it always say excellent so not sure why it take so long do not have that problem on my other

this is a great all around tablet this tablet is currently being used by my daughter and she love it it is a good size and the picture quality is good enough to watch cartoon and a few youtube video on the best part is that it ha a memory slot so you can save video on it for travel
this wa purchased a a christmas present for my aunt who life with u for the price i thought it would be a good option for her since she doe not want to drop the cash on an ipad for mparison the closest thing i have is an insignia tablet with similar screen resolution storage and feature that wa released at the same time the fire tablet impress me it is more responsive than the existing android tablet i have this tablet run fireos which is amazon is customized version of android typically i do not like custom android preferring to have a close to a vanilla system a possible i am not bothered by that with the fire if you need them the parental ntrols are send to none the amazon app store is extensive although not a extensive a the google play store still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there this is not a flagship device but performs incredibly for the price i will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself
gave to my great nephew yr old he love it and his father no longer ha to turn over his phone to his son
i love this speaker it doe everything you uld ever imagine love the fact that i can order something from amazon by just talking to alexa
i bought of these for each of my youngest grandaughters wanted something that would be made well easy to use and a they get older the range of use uld expand not only is it a good activity but a great learning tool i will download fun and game activity but learning also even though many of the fun and game are learning tool their age are and and they love them easy to download item save to home screen or remove item their are several parental ntrols and option so you can feel worry free can add more than one user and profile
it nice to have a mpanion that only talk when spoken to alexa is the only woman who doe not argue lol
i purchased this device a a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and i am very happy with it for that purpose it is the right size and the right weight the amazon case sold separately give it a real book feel if you are looking for more multi purpose use you may find this device frustrating especially if you have invested in google is esystem the device run on fire o amazon is flavor of android and app purchase are made through amazon is app store google play store and google service are not available on this device and the most essential google apps e g youtube are not available in amazon is app store that said it is still an excellent device for this price point
what can i say about a charger adapter it work great
work great and ha an excellent screen size you cannot go wrong for the price unless you need to install google apps amazon block them although i have heard there are work arounds
unfortunately i have been using a far superior tablet when i decided to purchase the amazon fire tablet mparisons are unavoidable the amazon fire work amazon only apps are not a numerous a google the tablet is not a streamlined a my other tablet
best tablet for the price bought of this and enjoying a lot
perfect size and very responsive i have of them
it now a part of our family it so much easier to ask for the time in the morning while my eye are still closed and light off setting the alarm ha been a breeze too just before we go to sleep me tell alexa to to sing u some song and we tell it to stop and it done i am now looking forward to get the light connected to this a well love it so far the only thing is i wish it had a better search feature that would search on the web
great a a digital assistant music grocery list etc but alexa is no google that is for sure for my u it is just fine supposedly alexa keep getting smarter so this should improve but it is not there yet
i love my amazon fire i use it everyday best item i ever bought everyone should have one
i bought this for a family member because they had the smaller amazon fire the version can be held easier in my opinion
nice screen which is easy to read we will have to see how it hold up with kid in the house
it would not turn on or charge we have to return it to kindle
just need more memory but we can handle that my boy love them
i bought this and the dot when shopping after christmas a spur of the moment decision it is so much fun and every day there is something new we love it
i have had this for month and i m still learning this is capable for doing so much my wife who is not into electronics love this i cannot wait until the echo can ntrol my sonos speaker
bought this for my daughter to play learning game on and to watch movie on in the car it is great it wa easy to setup a kid acunt so i uld limit what she had access too and i got to pick what she uld see great feature for all the family
quality product easy setup and all of the feature you need
alexa is amazing my whole family ha a new buddy to ask question to
nice to just check emailand read book i would remend
just got this today and have been struggling with a few thing set up itself wa pretty easy right oit of the box had no idea i would not have access to google play store beware there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device browsing is slow even while in the same room with my modem much slower than my phone or my other tablet tumblr app though able to be downloaded malfunction nsistently will probably return this and get a more capable tablet but will give it another uple of day to get used to it before doing so
i chose this item to a a giveaway for an office raffle i have the same one at home and i love it
good product and good price have enjoyed it since christmas and cant wait to read on it every evening
this tablet is very good specially for child they can download all the game they want to download on it
great device to have in your household ask alexa the weather or sport sres even turn on off light love it
i am a huge fan of alexa and it is because of the dot the echo is great also but the size make it a little bit more intrusive the only benefit of the echo over the dot is the speaker quality if that is the most important thing for you then go for the echo otherwise i would suggest looking at the dot the echo pick up your voice two room away setting it up uld not be easier and it link quickly to hue vemo and many other product highly remmended
a great choice for child age to or even a great tablet for adult it ha many apps and game to choose from the case it came with is very practical for beginner
bought online for my granddaughter and she love it i have to get one for myself after seeing the quality of the picture
great price great item and high quality simple to buy on line and pick up
the stick offer one of the best option if your trying to ween off the cable provider great offer
quick streaming and k capable make this device perfect
great speed and function for a small price doe what i needed
wa on the fence since i didnhave any other smart product but glad i took the plunge not having an amazon music acunt only limit what you can have alexa play but between the apps and directly connecting to phone you really do not need it
store is very clean never take longer the an hour for my item to be ready for pick up device work great ha received the lowest price
my wife love the echo and we would remmend to any of our friend
amazon keep adding more feature it willl be light year ahead of google home when it me out
you get to put all of your book right on this kindle and take it on the go with you it is great just taking one item with lot of reading material on it instead of having to take all of your favorite book with you
i use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and it ability to be independant of my phone tablet unlike normal bluetooth speaker that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality
great product would remmend to anyone work great
it is very simple to start up and use great for all age and experience on using tablet

the amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing video reading book and playing game small enough to fit in a bag or purse
amazon echo dosent hear well when the music is on full blast but when you do get thru she is very acurate
easy to install nice alternative to cable great show on demand
i like the amazon platform that it is on a it tie into my amazon acunt
have the original fire hd but wanted another one this one is great because of the camera
this is my send echo purchase i use alexa while getting ready in the morning instead of looking for a clock i ask alexa for the time time in the morning i use the echo to set alarm and to listen to news music the echo can also play book via audible oh i also use my echo to ntrol my light buy the echo it is usefulness is endless
bought the fire because i wanted to get vue from playstation which will not stream on roku first of all i do not like the fire is layout it is very cluttered and harder to find what you are looking for than on roku also i had trouble with the streaming and extreme amount of buffering while on wifi my modem wa only a few foot away from the fire roku almost never had buffering streaming issue i had to plug the fire directly into the modem in order for it to work this did take care of the buffering problem i gave it a good for working when plugged into the modem for wifi only it would get a rating of poor i am very glad i did not get the fire stick because it probably would have had major buffering issue if you are getting vue and need the fire i would remmend it if you are not getting an app that need to be on fire than i would highly remmend the roku roku is highly superior to the fire
great to search song check out news n weather ask information about a subject you are searching grandkids are forever playing with it
fire box is great easy start up and also to navigate thru for beginers in the streaming tv world
really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price at only dollar it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing video are sharp and clear most of the apps i need to use are available and free it seems to run similar to android tablet which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates this might be for kid to use but it fit with what i need to use
the screen is big and clear take good picture kid love it

you know for about a year now i have been thinking of getting a portable speaker so when the tap wa on sale i decided that this wa the perfect answer since i wa already mmitted to the alexa paradigm
when i first bought it and got it started it would not register my amazon acunt i tried making a new acunt and i tried using my mom acunt but it would not work so i took it back and had geek squad look at it and they claimed it wa defective and exchanged it for another one and the new one work wonderfully have not had any issue with it yet

processor is relatively slow but it is functional especially for mundane low intensity task only board memory can be enchanced with micro sd card
able to access movie and tv easy to use easy to set up
i went with this tablet based on many good customer review but my experience wa not a good one from the start i wa on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another most of the tech were very polite but not all knew the product very well at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage which told me they didneven know the difference between ram and regular storage the internet browser wa basic and it ran very slow at time even when all my other wifi device ran great then a day would pa and i d be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working wtf me to find out it is a known issue and they re working on it after two week of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it i wanted it to work and gave it a good run but just not quality stuff to me it wa like walmart trying to build their own mputer when they re obviously not a mputer manufacturer neither is amazon if i were you i d look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer which is exactly what i did next i got an asus tablet for only a few dollar more and it is unbelievable better in mparison to the amazon fire hd save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other mpany that is specifically in the mputer business full time sorry amazon not this time
please support mmands for the energysmart water heater ntroller by iris lowes item model mmand such a alexa turn water heater on or alexa turn water heater off would be nice it would gave been nice if amazon ha added a mmand support for this water heater ntroller by iris

i bought this for my yr old am impressed w the yr subscription to free time that wa included and the additional yr manufacturer warranty the actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use and am very happy for the parental option also think included apps are helpful really like the additional user option so anyone can have their separate preference set up the reason i didngive star is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doe not hold the rd at all and is always nstantly falling out which is extremely frustrating

the tablet is a lot smaller than my old one but it provides me with a lot more feature memory capacity and let me do thing i wa not able to do with my old kindle

it is an excellent product but will occasionally misunderstand what seem to be clear mmands know what you want to say to it before you do so it doe not like pause in speech it seems to integrate well with mpatible device and i love being able to use it to adjust my room temperature and lighting from bed

not a good a the higher end kindles but nice product for the price point if you re an avid reader and especially if you are an amazon prime member then this product offer an incredibly great price for entry into the kindle reading product especially now that there is amazon prime reading for even more value and selection join kindle unlimited in short this little device and a prime acunt offer an incredible selection for untless hour of reading i cannot see how you can go wrong unless you plan to watch video and then i remmend one of the nicer kindles maybe this one can do the job it is just an entry level basic model but for reading i do not believe you ll ever wish for more

finally received the kindle lighted leather ver for the newest version kindle it is very lightweight and i had to double and triple check the description nsidering it state this is a leather ver the front ver is very thin with a medium weight cardboard feel to it the leather on the front ver is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use the inside of the front ver ha a thin microfiber material to protect the screen the back ver is hollowed out plastic to form fit your kindle and snap in with relative ease using the enclosed graphic instruction card i removed the kindle a shown having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit ncerned for someone who would place and remove their kindle in this ver frequently however i plan on using this ver a a full time solution for both protection and a a light source i went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on heading to a closet to see how this looked in mplete darkness the light pull out of the back ver and is nice and stiff and ha a locked full out position the spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it doe reach the entire screen on the kindle there wa no glare or reflection and i wa able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining if i were to choose between this design and the kindle keyboard lighted ver which i have used since it release i would choose this newer ver read more
i love my amazon fire tv use it with playstation vue perfect device to cut the rd

i like the price and feature of the tablet it great in this price
despite of being a good idea it lack some logic or connectivity most of the question non related to the amazon universe do not have an answer although if you have a smart home device the functionality grows up exponentially
nice unit easy to setup and initialize i like the availability of the secure digital memory card can put my music and movie on the card and not take up the internal memory

if you have an amazon prime membership so that you are getting all of the video and music then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go it is not the highest end but work great with the amazon feature for a great price

i love my kindle fire so much so when i misplaced my first kindle i went to best buy to get another it wa only after all i read book on it but it doe so much more i watch movie play game shop browse the internet pretty much everything i can do on a much more expensive tablet
upgraded from the old kindle with the keyboard and wish i would have done it sooner beautiful screen nice and light perfect in every way the best way to read a book

alexia work well still a few bug that need to be worked out but she get better every day
i bought for my son and he love it he is year old
i absolutely love my amazon echo it is very nvenient and handy
this is an ok tablet we bought it thinking it would be good for travel with our little one but it is not what we expected our little one is able to exit out of movie and apps there is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little one this would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who want a tablet but doe not want to spend a lot of money
navigates easily many channel fast connection speed
good product the only drawback that i find are uld have been more interactive with a ntinuous nversation music should work without amazon music
good for on the go keep in mind that some apps are not mpatible due to it being amazon and not android overall a good purchase
for a cheap starter tablet it is fine bought it to replace a cheaper kid tablet and it ll do for that
doe what is advertised great with k handling seems to handle streaming very well customize able remmended if you re thinking of cutting the rd
work good just do not use it a much a i thought we would
back lighting bother my eye so i like that you cannoturn it off
i love the amazon kindle fire great buy i use mine all the time
very interesting device but having to touch button is a pain sometimes if that would bother you then go with echo
this is a great choice for kid is simple not expensive and a great alternative
the ui experience is great especially for prime member the tablet is quick and responsive with plenty of memory to ha for any task
got this for my mom and she love it good for game or reading on
bought this a a gift recipient wa happy to receive it after browsing price online i chose to purchase with best buy instead of amazon because it wa a better deal the free two day shipping wa a nice bonus a well a good experience all around would definitely remmend
mments on kindle paperwhite basic functioning of page forward back excellent footnote action often led to loosing place it wa easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text but often wa dead requiring selecting go to footnote picking the rrect footnote returned to rrect position but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote send me off to wrong text position while doing thing right raise no problem it is to easy to get in trouble enabling the x at all time would be safer occasionally a small print message such a highlighter would appear between the line supposed to show where other kindle user highlighted text doe not highlight any text
this is a great product that doe not have a lot of distraction for kid great little reader for the price
i have been a big fan of amazon kindles for the last five year each time a new one me out i hesitated to buy simply because my old one wa working perfectly christmas i wa looking for that gift that my wife would like she too is a big kindle fan i grabbed a paperwhite for her for christmas for the next five day i kept hearing how great it wa mpared to the old one so off to best buy to buy the send these are top notice upgrade i do not think i have grabbed my kindle and gotten the weak or dead battery logo it ha an amazing battery life on top of that the backlight work fantastic in low light environment i can sit on a plane and read with no issue
i enjoy my new fire system and i m glad i cut the rd
chose this over a regular bluetooth speaker and am so glad i did alexa really help me be hand free and get thing done the sound quality is great i have used it in the bathroom and no issue with steam
i wa so pleased with my fire tablet that i purchased two more for my niece who are and year old those little finger love the game and other feature and keep the girl busy in their car seat i love playing game checking the weather reading email and general surfing on the web with my fire tablet

i bought this on black friday for my wife and she love it it is build quality is good and doe not feel cheap it ha a decent front and back camera the interface is easy to use and there is plenty of game apps to add hour of entertainment i feel like the screen clarity uld be better but for the price you cannot mplain

i purchased this for my mom for easter her eye sight is not a good a it use to be but she loved to play game on her phone so this is bigger for her to play her game and for year young she is doing great with it
this is the third alexa i have purchased one for two home and one for work with amazon prime you can listen to music by just saying alexa play is rock it also give you weather turn on light with add ons and give you anything you d normally have to get by logging on to a mputer alexa what is the sre of the denver brons it tell you alexa how do you prepare chicken marsala it tell you get one
i had a nook but it died so i wanted a replacement and bought this fire tablet on black friday last year because it wa very inexpensive but a the old adage go you get what you pay for it is ok for basic web surfing but it is limited slow and ha one little speaker on the back so if you lay it on a table you wonbe able to hear it very well
i tried apple tv chrome tv roku but i like this the best
this product is very user friendly easy to use the remote is clean and simple in design
alexa is like my personal assistant she doe it all and keep me mpany when i m bored still learning new feature but this is the olest thing i have bought for myself in a long time
nice tablet for reading article and downloading book a downside is amazon limit some of the apps that are available for the price it is a good buy for my purpose
search menu are far more user friendly and we have not experienced any lockup which happened frequently with the roku device
i love that i can set time limit on how much time my kid can play i love being able to have them read for a certain amount of time before getting to pay also
got it for my dad easy to use and he love it good stepping stone for future producs
value to the product useful if you have amazon prime acunt and it is a good value for the money spent i bought it for my kid my kid like it
you get what you pay for or so they say we purchased and of the tablet ha started to fail mind you my daughter ha used it for a week we have had to reboot it time now of urse we googled the issue and were able to fix the problem ourselves it go mpletely black other tablet are perfectly fine so far
my daughter having fun with this tablet great christmas present

got this fire tablet for my youngest daughter for christmas and she love it i also love the option to restrict apps and ntent for her age
text look great on it my only issue the the browsing ability
alexa just need to better understand the question asked

i purchased this tablet for my mother a a christmas present she is not tech savy to say the least once she got it set up she ha fallen in love with i would highly remmend this tablet to anyone
easy set up great feature cannot beat the price
amazon echo is an amazing product great sound
work great easy to use play video and game good
awesome for year old ton of security feature and very easy to use
it is so much better than her viewing on her tiny phone great price too
easy setup and the echo voice activated search is a nice touch good set of application a well
good product and the quality of the product is good easy to use
i m more impressed with this that i ha anticipated alexa ha been very helpful around the house from music to oking timer and question with my kid now we are stocking up on the smart home item that work with it
cannot go wrong at to buck i also have the inch and prefer the in the hand i bought the eight for the extra ram gb instead of but have not seen any difference in the or while using it
i had a kindle once before and decided to try the fire it wa at a great price and i love it
what i really like is that you can set up different profile boy girl and myself and still you can use any device to play to favorite profile i bought and kid are very happy
the only thing holding this device back is amazon is unwillingness to play nice with other medium mpanies and a a result it is very difficult to obtain certain digital item on this device if it is not immediately available on the amazon store even so very good purchase
work very good and fast great screen resolution
one of the best streaming device for the price bonus point if you are a prime member or invested in amazon is infrastructure
very happy with this purchase which replaced a rd generation unit much easier on the eye and very responsive to the touch take a little to get used of the page foward backward on this device but no big deal the review on best buy site were very instrumental in making this purchase
wa gift fot my daughter she seems to enjoy very much
love the amount of apps on this thing love that i can watch anything with bluetooth headset while i m cleaning i love the speak to mmend however i wish you can request more than one route for traffic report my husband and i travel to different location everyday
i purchased this device to stream movie to a room that had minimal apps the i tried to activate netflix i kept getting an error on log in then after contacting amazon tech help researching found out that amazon netflix parted way and do not support each other so i returned the device and purchased the roku instead to great satisfaction
would definitely remmend very nvenient and very quick and responsive
it is the amazon version of appletv i guess i expected something a little more wow for the st but it look like amazon is app on my xbox and smart tv not anything super special it work a intended though and not really any problem the remote feel flimsy mpared to the aluminum of the apple tv gen
got it for my son to replace his old one and for the kid free time app good so far
great response and quick navigation on this device make it a pleasure to use software update frequently keeping your device up to date fire tv is extremely user friendly with a nice layout
do not hesitate to purchase work great my son ha the fire stick which work great but this fire tv is so much faster and more responsive love it
i did a lot of research before jumping in and buying the fire tv i am glad i took the plunge i have not had any issue at all since day one the speed is great with no lag and the recent update just kicked thing up a notch i love it
i purchased this for my son is birthday he loved it
simple to use and my kid pove it too bad the unit ha so much ad s
this tablet is quite durable the pink is vibrant and it is very easy for little finger to hold my granddaughter love it
finally an affordable name brand tablet with all the bell and whistle amazon ha outdone it is self with this little gem
great mpact tablet with great clors and resolution decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
i bought two of these for two of my child the parental ntrols are great and i can easily ntrol their access to ntent the ability to make them do something educational like read for min before playing game is awesome this tablet doe everything i wanted it to do
didnknow you had to buy space and many other thing for this item to work
have echo is and dot located in out two home love all of them very versatile and provide needed information and entertainment when and a needed very useful and st effective
my son love this tablet i would remmend for kid under teenage age great display not much storage but can add sd card
bought this for christmas after about month the battery began to fail to hold a charge while the first month were good a many of the review here laud this tablet the day warranty is disappointing from amazon when i did have a different amazon device fail within the warranty period their exchange wa immediate and easy for a brand new device so the only warranty issue is with the length i d remmend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it is just average
i like how cheap this is it is great for browsing the internet
really impressed with this little device it ha all the ell and whistle including k uhd streaming in netflix youtube and amazon video however it doe not stream in hdr not a deal breaker for me love this device
alexa is not only fun to ask question to but she also tell joke weather news tv program how to spell a word sport update and any thing else you cannothink of she is a hand free google you can even have her send flower for you more and more aps are ming available i love listening to either pandora or iheart radio the sound quality is very good we also have our lamp hooked up so she cannoturn this off and on when you tell her to
enjoying the kindle fire great for kid to use
work great have used both with wireless and hard wired work well both way have bought multiple fire tv box and had one that the wireless did not work so well so ended up hard wiring that one and everything wa good to go would have been a bigger problem if access wa not so close
my daughter really like her new kindle she love the lor and the size of the tablet work well and wa very easy to transfer her item from her old kindle to this one
i like the tablet for basic use but definitely enough for any kid
i took a billion picture and they are all clear all my game download with no problem and i will remmend this to my sister
i am very happy getting this a a gift i have had a blast getting acquainted with alexa
work great give weather report sends shopping list love it
i bought this for a gift but kept it for my self it ha basic functioanality but easy to use this definitely not for those expecting a powerhouse tablet but for a child it is great
great for my girl these tablet are great for smart and year old child
like most i love reading actual book that i can feel in my hand and turn the physical page of due to that thinking i spent year not really nsidering a kindle all i can say is that i wish i had one year ago it is incredibly easy to read on and so handy to have i load up ton of book which take up no space and am all set and i love that i can read before bed without having to leave the light on having a kindle ha reinvigorated my love of reading and i m reading more than i have in the last few year cannot remmend this enough
not a bad display for the price amazon ad pop up
i m new to tablet but this one is pretty easy to understand and use there is a decent amount of apps at start up which can be good and bad
good deal but i hate that because i buy tax exempt that best buy doesnt give me the reward point anymore that suck
i uld not find the charger anywhere else and this one worked great
i like the echo do not love it it is really hard to remember what skill you have enabled and how to ask question related to the skill
i am satisfied with this purchase it wa cheap and good for my son
this is a fantastic product for music love it and would remmend it
i purchased this for traveling i can access my e mail book and game without lugging my laptop i m sure i will learn more a needed
a little nfusing at first but once you get the hang of it it is very satisfying
replaced the roku so i uld have alexa change my show
great product you tube how much you can do with this box
i started out with an original kindle and wanted one with backlight and the price wa too good to pa up
the size is just what i needed for my outdoors kit i plan on using it mostly for reading it fit in my pocket
great product for the price i got it for my kid during thanksgiving and they love it
great price for this tablet my kid love it and we have not had any problem with it
bought tablet for my daughter and she love it also i play it a lot on it now writing this review
this wa my send e reader and i love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available
i m not a techno savvy person but found this extremely easy to set up i have managed to connect my nest thermostat and wemo plug to it i cannot seem to get the samsung tv to work with it oh well i primarily use it to listen to music and find the sound to be great one of the best purchase i have made in a long time
this item work just a i expected it to great product
once up and running alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant feature itll set timer tell you the time set alarm tell you what your day look like from your connected calendar tell you about your mmute or the weather and answer question about all sort of thing
great for the kid and protection is good and best buy is making me write more stuff here so that people can go ahead and buy this product
i have been playing with this for a few week it is not perfect but it is great for listening to music and audiobooks i do not like watching the news so the flash briefing is very nice sometimes it doe not get the full headline but i get the gist of it and i do not have to go through the depressing detail i m looking forward to learning how to create my own skill for it the speaker is not the best i have ever heard but it is definitely not the worst the ifttt integration is great and i have setup trigger to many device in my house and the shopping list is great
lot of fun to use linked light and temosta to to echo work great
good product overall i used it mainly to ntrol smart switch wemo ebee in addition to all the other smart thing you can do having an ifttt acunt is definitely helpful and mpatible with certain product not mpatible with chamberlin myq garage wifi opener
excellent product lot of upgrade to tap since original release a joy to use
purchased for my mother in law for mother day she is not a mputer person the ease of use wa great for her just touch the pic
very pleased experience installation and setup
this box is amazing very fast smooth interface kid friendly at a great price
my son love this tablet he is yr old and this thing doe everything great battery life also
i have implemented several smart device throughout our home like nest thermostat a sonos ntroller wemo switch a dropcam hd camera and a ring doorbell the echo is quickly beming the smart hub to ntrol many of these device setup wa quick and easy integration with my pandora and spotify acunts wa a breeze now i just need to patiently wait for my echo to beginning offering sonos ntrol
cant beat this tablet for buck great present for anyone
tablet is ok i just prefere android product i dont like the fire just being tied to amazon acunts and loaded with all their exclusive ntent but it a cheap quality tablet
my wife is a email and facebook user her laptop wa always needing updating and wa not the best thing for her she doe do some web surfing and it work for her
good tablet for the money would purchase again very fast
this thing is awesome i had a firestick and then i upgraded to the firetv and it is much faster and much smoother it is a model and i am not sure if it will be upgraded in the near future but it is pretty decent in also much easier and user friendly than the apple tv also cheaper
have not had it long at this time iam pleased with it
your can really ntrol what your kid get access to from apps video and the internet you can not get a better deal the yr anything happens warranty is a big plus it is not the fastest thing on the market it is desent picture quality is great everything that me with it just make it a real smart buy love the fact that i can program it to have her read min st before she can fully access it also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week
i wa impressed with the sound of the original echo the price of the dot the echo tap is the best of both and portable i have echo in multiple room i got this to bring music outside to the patio the music ha rich bass and clear sound perfect for tune or talk now that siriusxm is on alexa too i have access to great music howard stern nfl mlb and all the rest of the satellite radio ntent the great thing about the tap is unlike a normal bluetooth speaker this one work solo with alexa and wifi even my wife love it i think she talk to alexa now more than she talk to me
do you like to read if so this is an excellent device there are better device but at this price you are not going to find a mparable product
i use my fire hd to download book from the library easier to read than on my smartphone
it is an excellent gadget for getting information on lot of thing like weather playing music traffic etc i highly remmend this for household u
still learning the capability of alexa bot so far very impressed
i had the smaller version of this wa looking to get rid of it my google nexus this is just what i wanted it u my amazon prime acunt take a memory card so i can load it with all my video i watch while at the gym
this is ol help me keep up with to do list and quick answer
i saw echo at my usin is one day and by the next i had one there wa a short learning curve but we the echo and i achieved it
easy to hold read with no strain to eye love that i can highlight text
if i have to make an addition to my list alexa doe it for me it remember my music and it is the best mpanion so far i have purchased echo and dot
fire tv wa easy to install and very user friendly
for my son he love it ha it tied into electronics in his room
not bad especially for the price mine had one dead pixel in a prominent place that wa pretty annoying i ended up returning it and buying a lenovo tablet
great for a good read or binge watching in your bedroom slim size tablet so it fit perfectly in your palm
q what is the difference between a amazon w usb official oem charger and power supply and a v a ma usb port power supply ul listeda calling it a w charger rather than a v a charger is a distinction without a difference
yeeeeaaaahhhhh kid love this and so do i thanks again
this is much better than the fire tv but also a little bit more expensive it is worth it
this box will replace cable food and water if it didnï ½ï ½ï ½t need power iï ½ï ½ï ½d live for free
when you nsider the price paid for the amazon fire tablet it is much more enomical than a ipad or a samsung tablet i use it to check mail facebook twitter and other social medium site plus it is the perfect interface for all of the amazon apps
i refuse to buy cable and i wa using my mputer to stream show this wa interfering with my homework i decided to try the stick out but due to the upgrade they were out i bought the box instead i am so happy with my purchase it doe not overheat or get slow or have any of the problem the stock ha
cannot beat the price on this fire tablet hd very good display
very handy gadget performs well a little difficult to get used to the mmands and setting up music
surprisingly good and useful for the price you really cannot beat a tablet but remember it still is a budget tablet tip adding anti glare matte screen protector will great improve user experience and your interaction between finger and screen surface just like other budget tablet kindle fire lack that ating finish on screen surface which will cause screen to attract smudge more than tablet with that ating
we are enjoying our tv with the surround system the picture is great a you can see detail is in people and back ground we didnnotices before we need to get a new dish receiver to move the tv to it new location were we will be wireless
not sure if this is due to the new version but i m not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet amazon is really trying to lock out non amazon apps namely one from google aside from that though performance is already and what you d expect from a tablet in this price range this wa purchased for my mom and it doe what is needed and my mom ha no mplaints thus far
very useful and helpful tech at best buy st wa average
my son and my daughter is very happy they play nice game
my son needed a tablet to take note on at llege class he wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop he is found it to work perfectly for what he need
this wa an upgrade from old kindle screen is great and love the size of the screen
got this for my llege student she love it u it for weather news speaker and more
i uld not read on my kindle outside so i got the paperwhite problem solved
got my daughter son in law this for christmas and my husband really enjoyed it so i knew this would make a great gift for his birthday i wa very lucky and got the last one at our best buy store just set it up and having fun with it
the product i got wa the amazon fire box to go in my spare bedroom for guest instead of basic tv and defusing to pay cable service for an extra box
this is our send echo now have one upstairs and downstairs love having our favorite music available at any time and the sound is really good for the size of the unit we also have access to instant weather and information on just about any subject you cannothink of
very easy to use mpact to carry great value for price
we bought on the black friday deal and they are great the is better since it is bigger but they are still great
bought a fire hd tablet for my wife she doe not like using mputers and avoids smartphones but her new tablet is a big hit she u it to play game and to stream movie and radio program i use it for everything else reading news checking e mail online shopping etc it wa very easy to set up and even easier to use plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want
overall i am very impressed with the amazon tap the sound quality is not the best out there but the portability make up for this the volume is decent a well there were a few issue with connectivity over the holiday but for the past month it ha been flawless very satisfied with purchase
i had the fire model befor this one it wa ok but way too locked down this one is basically an android tablet with some key feature added for amazon little too baby for reading though prefer my paper white for that but great tablet for surfing game and movie youtube the only downside wonnnect over ghz wireless n stuck on the ghz connection
using it for reading ebooks on mmute and watching youtube what more can you ask for this price
bought for my wife a a birthday gift she absolutely love it
bought for grandkids they love playing the game that game with it
my son love it it wa very affordable and it ha everything you need i enjoy the mpact size

gave the family the echo for christmas and we are still learning how it can be used so far it is a hand free siri not a bad thing that can be used by the whole family it is an easy and fun way for u to learn about the iot
this is a good product for the price easy for kid to use
this is embarrassing i purchased one game from amazon app store the app crashed right away after i started it i do not know how amazon tested all these apps on their own device but the experience is really bad

i love d it i did return it for a roku not for the product quality i really liked the fire tv the only downfall wa the lack of tv apps that would work with my cable subscriber i did have issue with it over heating after talking with amazon i uld not leave the unit on top of my cable box due to the heat form that unit
this is a good tab for the price not a big issue if you break it
dad love it love love love it love it love it love
work out of the box no problem with setup connects to all the popular streaming apps like hulu amazon prime netflix
at first wa going to get a ipad but i decided to get this instead way cheaper then a ipad and just a good love it
i purchased two fire that were on sale the quality speed and display cannot be beat for le than by any other mpany and having the ability to expand it is capacity with a micro usb card is definitley a plus
i purchased of these fire hd tablet a gift they pack a lot of punch for the price i helped set them up so i wa able to get an idea of how they are going to work the screen wa very nice and clear speed of tablet wa good it is easy to use if you are already in the amazon family through prime it is a no brainer i do not believe you can get a better tablet at this price point
it is not the echo but for what i paid it is well worth every penny
traveled for work to an island for week wa great for plane ride there and back a well a on the island with me always being on the move
easy to use for my mom and toddler just like any kind of android device
purchased for the hand free interaction great speaker for music and amazon music variety surpasses xm being able to say alexa add to grocery list when i need something instead of having to find phone or pad and pen once at store i can call up list made by alexa and i am all set looking forward to setting it up to turn on and off light throughout our home
this is my third kindle and by far the best easy to use

this wa a perfect gift for my friend obsessed with reading and ha been perfect for starting a greater library of book very easy to use and extremely affordable very happy with this purchase and will buy more for family and friend
for you are getting a quality device that is perfect for web browsing and medium streaming
i like the fire tv streaming medium player it work well

it work seamlessly very great for price and clean finish
i wa a previous voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane do not forget to check the seat back pocket before you leave i wa debating whether to buy it again but all the review i saw online said it wa not worth the premium they re right first off the resolution is the exact same ppi on both model the voyage doe have better ntrast but it is something i stopped noticing after hour the backlighting on the paperwhite also is not a even a i notice it is darker on the bottom but again i stopped caring after a few u the weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery life about the only time i miss the voyage is when it me to the page turn button on the paperwhite i have to touch the screen so when i m lying in bed i m forced to use two hand to avoid it from falling on my face with the voyage i uld just press the page button and keep my hand on the border again far from a deal breaker and something i adjusted to quickly overall the voyage is the better kindle but not worth the premium st
it wa what i wanted for my bday but now the wholee house want it too
great tablet for the beginner or young child would remend
tablet is very simple and easy to use daughter love it
this is a great device for those who are looking for time saving throughout the day i am still learning how to use the echo but i have the basic down you can ask about the weather news briefing joke play music etc so far so good
i play game read book watch movie surf the web love the expansion capability
love it really light weight so easy to carry in my purse and read book on it during my daily mmute on the train
the echo is a great addition to our house love that you can ask her anything it always answer instant wife u the timer all the time plus now she listens to music all the time
mpared to all other inch tablet this amazon fire tab just outperforms them by mile and yes you can add the google play store without rooting the device
we bought this tablet for my year old father who wanted something handheld to play game and read his email it is good for that screen is too small for elderly eye but it made him feel like he wa getting with today is technology it wa very cheap on black friday
bought this for my other tv which ha an amazon fire tv stick world of difference a the fire tv is so much faster buffering no problem
great for reading in the sunlight a well a light and easy on the wrist great product but a little speedy
great price and great for young one and a good tablet for beginner
purchased on black fridaypros great price even off sale very powerful and fast with quad re processor amazing soundwell builtns amazon ad amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the add if you pay them inability to access other apps except the one from amazon there is a way which i wa able to acmplish to add the google play storenet this is a great tablet for the money
i got it to gift my niece they should be very happy to get it product look good all the feature like screen camera processing speed is good for the money you get it

i have bought fire tv originally for my send tv which is not a smart tv show start playback instantly voice search is the easiest thing to use my only mplaint is that voice search doe not work in rd party apps yet
absolutely love it friend and family all purchase on
i love the amazon echo we are having so much fun with it and it wa so easy to set up we re still learning all it can do i wa very satisfied with best buy is service and delivery also
the amazon fire is really easy to navigate and use i really like it
i wa pretty impressed with this little device it wa easy to setup and work rather well i had also bought a ipad air with gb during bf for after playing around with the hd fire i returned the air because it met my need at a much lower price i added a gb sd card and am downloading movie from netflix the hd display is very clear battery life uld be a little better but overall i m very satisfied with it the free stuff you get with an amazon prime acunt is icing on the cake i dig it
powerful tablet perfect for the kid ha everything they need all for under great buy
gave this to my son in law perfect gift he love the paperwhite
really like my fire specifically bought it for a vacation so i uld read and check my email for my business so far i love it only downside is the connection speed is somewhat slow when connected through wifi at home it is slower than any laptop also if you want to play game i highly suggest the larger version hoping my husband get me a stylist for christmas to make some of the game a little easier
i purchased this for christmas it wa easy to set up and am now looking to purchase more for the other room
i love this box with it bigger memory capability look great on my k tv
install wa easy only issue wa using it with psvue
it is nice to have parental ntrols but app grouping and bug with apps hurt the experience parent will still need to look over child is shoulder to ensure game apps are appropriate battery life is absolutely terrible
me and my husband love them we bought for our kid and they love them so easy to use and the kid profile is great
this keyboard work a a case a well for your ipad and when attached seems just like a net book i really like it i think i will end up buying another for the mini ipad
everything he need but nothing more the case looked a little flimsy but it ha been great so far
overall it is a good tablet but i am not a fan of the limitation of the silk browser and amazon app store
great product have not used the shoulder bag much i do not travel much nice to have just in case
perfect for cutting the rd on expensive cable and satellite
the quality is awesome for the price amazon product are always ol
i had previously purchased the amazon fire tv stick which worked ok but wa lacking in some area i upgraded to the full blown amazon fire tv mainly because of the faster wi fi that is included it make a substantial difference when streaming hd ntent additionally this unit ha a faster processor and more memory than the fire tv stick to me it is well worth the extra
we upgraded from the dot to the echo and we are glad we did
great sound quality and very sleek to fit into any room dr due to the price reduction during the holiday i ranked it a versus a if the regular price wa applicable to my purchase satisfied enough to purchase two amazon dot for my family a christmas stuffer which they loved
i have no idea why someone would need to pay hundred for a tablet when they can just get a fire
my wife is old kindle died a uple month ago i looked around for a replacement and best buy offered the most mpetitive price
we loved this purchase would remmend to others
it is a great for reading book but it is not that great when it me to everything else
i got this on sale for dollar and i expected something different because of the low price i would pay a hundred for a replacement if this one ever break very good product
i love that there is a kid profile you can create on the tablet very user friendly
i work with technology every day and this device wow even me with alexa imagine siri on steroid able to ntrol your entire music llection stored in your amazon library a well a music from iheartradio prime music nest thermostat etc ask for a joke get news update set timer and alarm all with your voice and with very little misunderstanding honestly siri never impressed me much but alexa is super fast and responsive
this device ha so many great feature i love how it stay charged for so long and the font can be enlarged for easier reading
i have a older kindle loved it i love the new storage on this one and easy to use button great battery life
for it price this a great little tablet it doe have limitation on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason i gave it rather than star hopefully amazon will allow it to perform better soon
i got this for my teenager and she love it the only hard part wa getting it set up for her without giving her access to my acunt
it is great to some extent but i wa expecting more it is unfortunate that it doe not work with lot of apps perhaps i m not using them rrectly i m still learning
good capability good sound quick response good amount of application which respond quickly
this is an inexpensive alternative to a tablet and larger than a phone the memory is small at gb but can be expanded with a micro sd card plus you are not slowed down by nstant window downloads
i enjoy this tablet and will buy another one for my daughter to use
much better than the fire stick faster and le buffering
i purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment i enjoy playing game and this tablet is great for that purpose also plan on using it for reading electronic book
kid love the tablet the picture quality is good
the fire tv is better then the chrome roku and even the apple tv yes i said it it better then apple tv and it cheaper to also kodi
this is my send amazon fire purchased it from best buy for a christmas gift when a deal wa running after opening the package found a scratch on the screen took the product to store best buy changed it promptly the new one is quiet right
it is small enough to fit in my purse with ease the back lighting work well in darker area and i just love using it
i just love my new kindle paperwhite
tablet help get child use to having a tablet also good for alduts
it is light weight easy to read in any light level especially outside which is a nice improvement from my last one
it doe the job
i had a kindle before this time i chose the paperwhite because there ha a light and touchscreen i really love the kindle product very nice buy
good product work a intended i like the ability for additional memory a well a k ability
i read the review before purchasing this so i went into it knowing there will be apps pre loaded that i will have to remove that being said i purchased this for my yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose nsidering it includes the case and no hassle protection guarantee
got one for me and for my older daughter love it a lot
i brought this tablet for my son for christmas and he love it i would definitely remmend this tablet a a starter tablet for younger kid
i had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the paperwhite because i read at night it wa a great decision because when i turn the light all the way down i cannot read at night it is lightweight and sturdy my only mplaint is the speed of switching between book and the strange flicker with the page turn it is not a show stopper because it is so much better than trying to read on my ipad mini
i really like the paperwhite it made me want to read book on my kindle again try it if you hate it return it but get your hand on this for a while and i m nvinced you will keep it
good little tablet but i do not like that there is not a big choice of apps
i have been an apple user and this is my first kindle a a gift from my husband i am impressed with the display great price point i do not like the ad that i have to put up with i didnknow i have to pay to remove them thumb down
save some for hight price cable tv this is the reason why i cancelled my cable tv
i am bring it back for an exchange a different make
great option but uld always have more more apps
the best add on to your tv ever shopping streaming all together
my grandson had an older kendall and i bought him a new were one and he love it and it is a wonderful device
this tablet run great and look nice easy to use and get around in the menu only problem i had wa i uld not get my pc to see the tablet to move my book to it
i really love how this product work it is fast and easy to use when the erthernet cable is connected to the router the wifi distance to the router is very poor you almost have to put it next to the router my tv is about foot from the router and i am able to use nextflix wifi without any lag but the amazon fire tv is not in range it is in range right next to the router
work a intended and this is the nd unit purchased
very good bookreader long battery life and easy to download book and return to public library

easy to read in daylight and optional backlight make this a great device i miss the side button of the older version and it uld be easier to tap the screen with the left hand to advance the page
this is an awesome little inexpensive tablet it is not the fastest but it get the job done well i just surf the web and watch video online i also downloaded the spotify app and listen to music next i ll download netflix it get the job done very well
i use the echo to turn on and off light play music and ntrol my air nditioning i bought a wifi thermostat and smart plug to plug my light into and they work well with it i like it but i wish i did more useful stuff like i do not need alexa to tell me a joke
sharp screen that is not too big or small take some getting used to if you normally use an iphone be prepared for ad which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price slim profile just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality hard to find case at physical store
i like this reading device i use it almost everyday i read more book now
very easy to set up took maybe minute quality and service is great
it fast when you request artist song and album and weather
glad i upgraded to the fire kindle a it is much easy to read on than the black and white kindle i had previously the lor and graphic are very clear it is easy to work on for many task and the search mode is great
perfect gift for the tech family and introduction to the numerous option now available through wireless connection
great value easy to use fun to use easy to set up
love it it is like having a personal assistant very good
this product my not fully mpare to more expensive tablet but amazon ha made improvement that provide a platform to watch medium and read further amazon ha made significant stride to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet
it is easy flexible to use much le expensive than other tablet
year old daughter is happy with this table work very well with wifi and is easy to download app
work great faster than fire stick and support sub keyboard have not figured out how to nfigure keyboard for bluetooth
i love this tablet and it is easy to use i would buy another for sure
a good product with annoying limitation like limited knowledge about thing it doe not always access my music on mmand although the music is in prime music
good tablet for the price quality brand and service
very durable and easy for my yr old to use the price wa just a plus
youtube play only in the desktop version not the mobile version
love my kindle it is perfect to take with me on the go very easy to use
im an avid reader this device it fantastic sure beat carrying a book around
my twin love their tablet and i am able to down load lot of educational apps for them
very good product and easy to use and very helpful
very durable and easy to use last for several year with all that it can do
i bought the kindle fire for a medium source for my music since it wa cheap the only problem i have found so far is there is not a good music player to download if anyone know of a good one please mment if possible i also use amazon music app i wish this had bluetooth capability but for it can be forgiven probably a good tablet for kid i wish i would have just bought a samsung asus or lenovo tablet instead but really this is pretty good
we bought the echo because we listened to the music at a friend house we came home and ordered it that day we think this is the best little invention so far we love listening to our music anywhere there is an outlet and wifi go buy one you wonregret it
great tablet all around good for kid for the parental ntrol option
i gave this amazon fire stick a a father is day present so i am not a personal user of the product but have heard it wa nice
better then my old kindle more feature i m able to return my library book where on the old one they would have to expire
it an alright tablet but i wish you uld download more apps
alexa is amazing music is easy to get either from amazon or pandora alexa easily understands mmands wish others in my family responded a well a she doe
the tablet is up to date technology my daughter surf the internet fast and no slow download
bought this a a christmas present for my wife read it all the time
purchased this tablet at a great price this tablet work very well within the amazon esystem so it is best geared towards those with amazon prime it ha micro sd card slot which is a plus
bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing game etc i have used it a few time and like it
the amazon kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed the device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet
for the most part this is a great little streamer it ha most of the apps that i need big exception is xfinity support i cannot run any xfinity apps from it and i assume that i cannot run hbo go because of that otherwise it is fast and easy to use love the talking remote
i didnt realize how handy she is until i decided to pick one up last week when best buy had a flash sale
this review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me i would put it down just upgraded to the echo instead of the tap
great option for my office to make use of my amazon prime membership better if it had a browser but the voice option alexa is wonderful search app option is welmed i may add the game ntroller soon
nice toy but not very useful unless you are ntrolling a house full of appliance light etc also not a fan of bing which is the search engine the echo u
i love to ask it to play my pandora station while i ok
yes it doe what i need and doe it pretty well i like the extra storage capacity because i use it to store photo a portable portfolio i like the size smaller and easier to carry than a tablet device it is my send one i use both unit the older one just doe not have the storage capacity
i m really enjoying my kindle fire i love the size and the ability to fit it into my purse great for reading on the plane
a great tablet for the price i love now that the amazon fire tablet ha a micro sd slot lightweight connect to net easy
this is a good device for entertainment and entry level task i think it can do a lot for the price
i bought this for my kid and i wanted to get them a tablet but still restrict what they uld do this tablet ha fantastic parental ntrols i opted to include the freetime membership and that put them into a kid specific app center where they just click and play without the visible hassle of downloading fee and ad it is been very sturdy with the year old overall i am extremely satisfied for a kid tablet not sure i would buy one for me personally but great for kid
i have tried several tv box but this one is so far the best
my mom love it for reading my mom is not tech savvy but she wa able to adapt pretty quickly
purchased for a family member they love it would remmend
i received this tablet a a gift i love it so much that i bought one for my husband
i traded this in after receiving a at christmas and i am happy i did i love the size of the screen for reading my book which i have too many of and a great size for watching movie i do wish i had the capability to use internet when i am away from home yet other than that this is a great buy
this review me with a caveat many tech site say e reader are dying kind of like the nintendo is doooooomed crowd or the gps is obsolete argument i do not disagree a our phone beme more sophisticated and the phone screen size ntinue to balloon up to tablet like proportion dedicated device will ntinue to go the way of the dodo but sometimes if you re interested enough a dedicated device is precisely what you need i had key word had an ipad mini that i had been using a my all round in bed netflix reading machine except i d get about sends in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up a i spend more time reading on my ipad than watching netflix i decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy kindles one for my wife and myself the new kindle paperwhite feel just a solid a the outgoing model but the resolution is now dpi the e ink screen almost feel like a page of a paperback when you swipe and in my personal preference i like that the battery is rated to last week on average between the various tech site which trump my ipad mini by several life cycle yes the screen ha to refresh unlike a tablet but it is not very noticeable and i do not find it distracting at all for reading case are not nearly a ubiquitous a for the ipad so you have basically got the standard amazon branded leather case or offbrand case from site like ebay i enjoy reading and i frankly do not want to wear any thicker glass than i already have backlight can cause bad eye strain so that is another plus for the kindle over the ipad in summary tl dr if you want a dedicated e reader you cannot go wrong with the kindle pw the price performance ratio is much better than the voyage imho but that is assuming that you re somebody who spends enough time reading to make the kindle device worth carrying if you only read for a few sends here and there adding an extra device to lug around is not for you so like a garmin the market ha a specific niche and ymmv depending on your need for me the kindle wa a great fit
great for keeping around the house and doing basic internet function for traveling it let you bring book movie and or tv show via amazon so being amazon prime is a plus for you business traveler out of the box it can open view edit m office file docx xlsx pptx all this for the price of a ipad yes the ipad can do more but do you need it
if you re looking for an all in one device that can surf the web read e book watch video and more look no further i purchased this tablet for my daughter and she love it the price point is perfect too it doe not have hd or retina display but it is not an issue for me
i bought this for my daughter she love it i love the free time app
this is my send fire tv and the setup is a easy a the first very simple to use and the benefit pay for itself worth it
ergonomic and easy to get new book my house is full of book and i need to quit stockpiling them and i cannot remember what i read year ago this device help
what a neat gadget it is is easy to set up and we have had a lot of fun with alexa
great size work with all apps no issue yet would buy more
i really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous kindle reader like the previous kindle readeri dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown
love it use it everyday and enjoy the book i have read on it
absolutely the best purchase i have made this year
so impressed with the battery life on this my phone is battery is almost dead in the morning but this thing can play music for hour and the battery just go down
great for medium nsumption screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it wifi connectivity is good speaker sound poor but i didnexpect any better from an tablet have had this tablet since november and is still going strong only mplaint is the slow charging but it is not too bad
i bought this for our foster child a a christmas present
purchased for myself and just love it it is just a nice a the kindle
i am pleased with unit i wa surprised that it doe not pair with external speaker but other than that good product
decent screen kinda slow response on the touch screen
i like the reader nice and small what i do not like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home it doe not let you set it up i had to go to my daughter house and set it up that is a bit alarming it should be more secure since the only way we can put item on there is by putting our information on it that can be mpromised make it more secure and easy to put protection on it that is the only reason i didnmake it a star product
it is a learning process google home wa friendlier and changed the lor of my light but echo is pretty funny
we got this tablet for my son and it ha been a great fit the screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish nsidering the price and that it is intended for child i think it is great
able to watch so many movie netflix and get access to more than just the normal cable offspring
i bought this for my yr old sister and a gb memorystick to put all her movie on it and it work great but you have to find a app that play it since the install one wa a little hard to use for a kid
great for streaming music weather forecast sport update news briefing etc work a advertised only drawback is not a knowledgeable a the google home ha some limitation but work great with suggested application
this unit with amazon prime is a blast use it to have fun dance party
great value for a tablet wa a gift for dad in his fifty and it is simple enough for him to use and play word game and watch netflix and stuff got it on sale for which wa a steal i should have gotten another one for that price best buy always ha great price and selection especially when they go on sale dad love his amazon tablet
this tablet is a steal if you get the chance to pick one up and you need is good reliable basic tablet this be the one do not walk run to best buy to pick it up
this tablet ha the best battery ive ever seen the picture is great too
i bought this to replace my nook since it wa such a great deal it did not disappoint great graphic sharp fun game and free apps
ntinually loses connection to the internet app say it is connected but say check back later worked for the first month or so but now work one minute and dumb two minute later nstantly asking alexa alexa alexa
we purchased this after we decided to get rid of cable very easy to navigate much better than using a game system
this is a great tablet at a great price unfortunately it cannot connect to google play without hacking if that is what you need look at the acer tablet if you are looking for an inexpensive fire tablet you cannot go wrong with this
this item is great for kid reading set up a kindle acunt and they pick the book many free
all in all it is a great product however i find it limited by the need and expense for additional accessory an example is you can call from it but only if the receiving person ha a similar device the sill are tricky to learn but manageable some of the task that you ask her can be hard to get rrect it just take some practice all in all it is really ol
i bought this for a friend is birthday he loved it he is a heavy reader and he uld not believe how amazing the kindle wa
the tablet with an added protective case ha so far held up better than other tablet i have tried and the parental ntrols are great i can also add educational apps that i want
still learning the thing alexa can do but so far i m extremely happy with my purchase
my granddaughter love her tablet she love watching movie and learning new thing
worth the price you pay for the product thank you
i bought this echo because of the price it fun i like the stereo mponent the most but i also play with alexa often still learning how to submit the skill most of which you need to interact with alexa
gift for the wife she rea ly like it and u it a lot
if you have slow internet like myself get this one not the fire stick i have mb internet and at time buffer at p but when switched to almost no buffering that is an issue on my side not the device easy to tranfer apps from android phone using app called appsfire available at the play store most apps transferred work but not all of them rd party game pad work also via bluetooth a
not the quickest tablet out there but it doe the job and you cannot beat the price great for reading book and magazine or light internet browsing
great to interact with a product by voice that can provide information a well a enjoyment
love the mpact size ease to read ability to easily access library and back lighting make this a great product
this device wa easy to use it wa a it wa described
got it for my daughter birthday we all enjoyed the echo thinking of getting another for myself
we had an older model from and it broke so we just replaced with newer one love the new feature

extremely durable and user friendly very satisfied with this product
very portable easy to use well worth the price
great gift for my niece and you cannot beat the price
i think this is one of the better streaming device

love this tablet easy to use battery life great
my kid love this tablet there are over hundred of game book and show to pick from
love the voice feature and since going to this i have saved ton on cable bill
very easy to set up and begin using live fire stuck and fire stick tv
holding up well but purchased a good case like the kindle a lot
price wa right bought it mostly to be able to watch movie but the quality of the movie is not a good a i had hoped which is the main reason behind my average rating
great speaker but i really do not need the feature i just need good sound and do not really use anything besides that
this is great for thing like pandora and playing music from your amazon library by just asking alexa i also wa able to get a thermostat that wa mpatible and can have alexa change the temp by asking her to wemo device are touch and go sometimes after a wemo firmware update they do not work also it uld use a line out to hook up to a receiver like the dot doe note it work with spotify if you have a premium acunt only not the free one
i bought one for my dad liked it so much i bought one for myself even better than the paperwhite
great gift for my kid is send birthday this product is very child friendly and easy to use i remmend this product for family
for the price and size ease of use you cannot go wrong and if you dont try to use it for more than it is meant to be reader surfing watching ntent and shopping great low st choice
use it every day for news weather music alarm clock
my granddaughter used her phone nstantly to play game and when she needed to make a call phone is dead now with tablet she facetime me more and her phone now keep a chatge
my kid love it i have of this and they all work good
i bought this for my sister in law for christmas and she loved it
good and easy to buy this tablet with low price worth to buy
i got two of these for my kid if they break oh well good for a step up from leappad
good for beginner my staff really liked this treat for christmas
uld not be easier to set up and use wifi is flawless if ethernet is not available loaded with ntent
way faster than the fire stick better over all connection
i use this mostly a an e reader but it is also great for web browsing and e mail i didnexpect such good performance for the price but i have no mplaints
easy to navigate easy to understand how to load apps
it is so much easier to hold a kindle than a heavy book and i love it i also like that it is lighted
very good just do not forget to ask for the none promo one
i have had at least three amazon fire and have been very happy with each one
love having the amazon fire are able to download apps watch video from amazon prime and it includes profile so kid can have access to it a well highly remmend
amazon fire is almost relevant to a tablet which hold post of the feature and respect to processor speed it more than the expectation to surf and listen music
good feature alexa integrates very well into daily life also speaker sound is quite good
rd cutter here we had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our mfort zone since we are prime member we finally decided to give amazon fire tv a shot we have been using fire tv for two week now and we ll never go back to cable pro ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which take up very little space simple remote and a free app so you cannoturn your cell or tablet into a remote no buffering issue have yet me up although that may be because i have a very strong internet connection seamless interaction with our prime video acunt and amazon music across all device for example if i download a movie from prime on my tablet watch some of it during my mmute when i get home and turn on fire tv i can pick up right where i left off from my tablet seamlessly without having to manually sync me with thousand of channel apps loaded including all of the the major service we use can be used for game we have not tried any game yet the voice mmand feature is outstanding speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it with multiple option for buying renting or just viewing for free if available i have never been a big voice mmand user with other device but this one work so well that using it ha already beme a habit using the amazon photo app you can instantly upload all of your digital photo from your phone or tablet to your fire tv for large screen viewing of your photo n no way to customize the home screen layout at least no way that i have been able to figure out overall i m kicking myself for not doing this sooner read more
best remmendation for a tablet that doe everything you need it to do expandable memory is a great upgrade to the fire
for the price that i paid for this tablet ut is a great deal it doe exactly what i bought ir for
so after visiting my sister and brother in law who use an amazon echo to run just about everything in their house i just had to have one i purchased my own amazon echo the minute i got home from my trip i am now on my way to building my smart home my wife and i have enjoyed using alexa to help u with recipe measurement check the weather for the day set reminder and play our favorite music we are now working toward building and buying item such a wifi light switch a smart thermostat and a few other item that will all work seamlessly with alexa it will take a while to get it all done but it is a lot of fun the amazon echo is such a blast to use take your first step in building your smart home with the purchase of an amazon echo
the echo is a ol speaker and ha some neat trick if you re vested in the amazon universe i am not it is still neat a a bluetooth speaker but if it were noton sale i would not find a much utility for the price
wonderful product to have for toddler and preschooler
i absolutely love this tablet i check my e mail i watch movie the only thing i do not like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problem taking you to the rrect site but you must remember that it is a tablet not an mputer i find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it ha unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it take just a few minute amazon prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movie and read book a almost everything available st money prime is a money saver and it last a full year it also me with free shipping i tried it and it is good i receive my purchase in day prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it me with a lot of perk
easy to play and very helpful to learning for child s
easy to use great ver and a lot of option for app game my daughter love it
best tablet ever not just an ereader i have had several tablet and this one is my fav
i have two echo dot and two other echo and i love them it is nvenient look great and sound great got my last two echo for a great price
the amazon echo ha been an amazing and also somewhat frustrating experience the nvenience it brings with timer turning on connected light playing music and just rny joke is amazing i love this machine but it also doe beme a little frustrating when it doe not work immediately in the time i have had it it ha mostly worked on the first try but there are definitely day when the light wonall turn on when asked sometimes it take a long time for alexa to respond to the mmands uld be an internet issue but still detracts from the experience all in all it is an awesome device and i have enjoyed it immensely
this is a great reader and ha lot of new feature go with kindle paperwhite
great product for any office or home a little pricey most of what it doe do can be done from a smart phone
bought it for tbe grandson to play game on it is ok for that i have had nook tablet before and i think tbey are a little better than the amazon it doe fine for what we bought it for
i got a send one for my downstairs tv work great
very lightweight just a nice a the next one up that you can only buy online would remmend this to all my friend and family
i own a uple firesticks and decided to give the fire tv a try i m glad i did because you cannotell the difference right out of the box not that there is anything wrong at all with the stick but the smooth speed and response is a welmed attribute to my most used television
nice clear picture and easy to follow instruction for use of box
we actually bought these for summer camp and the kid love them and they work like a charm the staff wa a lot of help
i had problem with my white page and wa in the process of buying ad new kindle i found this wa a better unit for my use than tine white page
my mom ha enjoyed using this product we are looking at purchasing prime the nest and light bulb so they can ntrol it all from there
the product wa for my daughter she love it and play with it all of the time
only downfall is there are lot of pop up ad otherwise a great inexpensive tablet
cannot believe how much fun we have had with our new echo love all the music we can listen too so quickly
the page look like actual page from a book to allow for easier reading bought this for my mother in her is and she love it
performance of the device is good meet expectation
i bought this to replace my old roku and i am mpletely satisfied with the purchase
i wa not a fan of the amazon type operating system that is on the tablet ended up taking it back because it wa not what i wanted not a easy and supportive of game and apps a an android tablet
the new fire hd tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version storage doubled to gb and the ram increased by to gb this make the tablet faster and more responsive with the improved battery life and much lower price this is a great general purpose tablet
i wa a little upset at first after purchase seeing that i pretty much need to be an amazon prime member to get the full benefit of amazon tv on the other hand it is way cheaper than having to pay a cable bill in the long run
this amazon tablet is for the money the best one on the market today i purchased them for christmas gift this year and when i saw them grabbed out of the that were on display i did so because last year when i tried to get one everybody wa sold out not to be had
i love having all of my streaming video in one place and log on his single remote
at a price that doe not require a bank loan or cashing in that retirement annuity
the tablet is okay my daughter u it most of the time
overall dynamite product it give you instant access to a variety of show
love my amazon echo the white look good in my kitchen great speaker play music all the time use the timer feature daily also alarm shopping list and reminder wish i had one in every room
i really get the most of my amazon prime video now i find it is easy and responsive to use the main pain is having to change the input so you have to use three ntrollers the medium ntroller the cable ntroller and the original tv ntroller fortunately i m used to that with my apple tv it is le fussy than the apple tv especially when you view amazon ntent well it naturally would be because the ntent is automatically there
whole family is enjoying it kid and we are both able to use and user friendly
wow what a tablet my girl are have the time of their life hey it wa a little learning in the beginning but once they got it the rest wa history
bought it for father is day and my dad and mom love it
i had some thought about getting this for a year old but if you get the screen protector and a case i feel it will last a long time
this is a great value work great a a table ha a good camera and serf a a good mp player love that the storage can be expanded
this tablet is great nsidering how affordable it is i mainly use it for reading streaming show and listening to music i do wish it wa a true android platform instead of the amazon android platform but overall it is a great little tablet
love it for the price paid perfect holiday gift for kid and adult
this wa bought primarily for photo i added the card putting in the card might have been a little tricky but the sale rep did it for me my wildlife photo look brilliant on the tablet i d remmend making a geek squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet that way you learn how to use it before leaving the store also i got one that had been returned but all the part still had the plastic wrap on them that made it le and hence the great deal in the title it may pay to ask about a return i plan to take some of the free class offered
love it great addition to my k amazon prime and unlimited music
great for getting movie without adding extra to your cable bil very small device
much better than i expected for the very reasonable price
this tablet is perfect for a parent who want to monitor what their child are doing a well a being able to ntrol what their kid can and can not do on the internet
i am extremely happy with my new kindle voyage the text is so sharp and crisp the image look much better than on the kindle paperwhite the device is extremely light and mfortable to hold the adaptive front light work great i have an ipad with the kindle app but the reading experience is so much better on my kindle voyage that do not regret the purchase one bit
i purchased this tablet when it wa on sale for black friday overall it work great cannot beat the price
great tablet love everything about it good selection of apps for free if you decide to buy apps is also worth it cheap price
so nvenient and hand free ntrol of function i d normally do on my iphone
it work great we are using it to play pandora music all day at the store so far we do not have any issue it work very nsistently
enjoying easy selection of music and exploring her sense of humor have had many good laugh from interesting interaction talk to her daily and my wife doe not mind
still learning the u for echo and it seems i will never fully understand a new u are add almost daily via amazon and the never ending apps that are added
my internet is so awful that streaming music is so choppy and sporadic it reminds me of vinyl rerds likeabroken rerd
it wa all that my grandson wanted and didnhave to search everywhere to find it
i have always been pleased with kindle fire in fact i think i wore out my previous one for some reason i cannot turn this one on and went to best buy to ask someone to help me with it but it seems you need an appointment even for this probably simple chore
the echo ha been a smash hit it work well with device and is easy to set up the access and use is very simple my son is taking it to llege with him and he love it
cant beat it for the money plus it very durable
great for browsing streaming and everyday web usage
worth the purchase make watching show easy plug and play
work great wife love it always happy with the kindle
gift for my mom easy to use with her limited technology skill answer are limited uld not identify closest showing of a movie to our house for an example
bought on black friday for my daughter she thought i paid more for it it doe a lot she love it
i would definitely remmend it to others since it is a good value for money product
fun to play with a great source to gather information from without cracking a book
so happy with this kindle it is very easy to use lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book except here you have an entire library with you it is easy to download book you can set up a wish list read several book at the same time and you never loose your page the screen light are fantastic when you read in the dark and there is absolutely no glare when you read in the sun the only drawback is that i thought i would be able to purchase book on any amazon site so that i uld read book in french if they re not available on the u is site and it turn out you cannot you can only purchase the ebooks from the untry your kindle is set up that wa a real disappointment a i had read some review before buying it where they said you uld overall i absolutely love it and if you re a book worm like i am than i would absolutely remmend it i would actually remmend it to any one
it is a basic tablet nothing fancy but great for it price
i had ordered the echo and from what i had read i did not think i would need the remote the echo work great if you are in the same room i like to listen to music while i am oking cleaning or doing nothing i always had to go back in the same room to where my echo wa to change or skip to the next song if i wanted with the remote i can change it from any room i just stick it in my pocket and take it out when i want to switch turn it down or up connects through blue tooth very quickly ha a magnetic holder to keep the remote on mine is on my desk leg to keep it when not in use there is a felt pad on the back of the magnetic holder so that it will not scratch any surface that it is attached to i love it
use it daily because of it streaming capability and how clear it is i m saving a ton of money from not having cable
my wife like it she read a lot so she u it all the time also like to go online with it
my year old love it i love that she can use it unsupervised without worry she ha been learning her alphabet and this ha been a great tool
love it i download all of my audiobooks on my tablet
it a great great gift that can be used by everyone
i originally purchased the google home and it wa very nice but speaker wa not loud enough and it wa ugly on my night stand i swapped to the echo and it is nice looking at the illumination when responding the bad part of this device is you have to be very specific when making request and the echo cannot hear you when the volume is over if i had to redo it i would probably keep the google home it wa more accurate even on my wake up alarm
i love all of them i would remmend going to best buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out
bought this tablet on black friday and i m very happy with it have not even touched my ipad since buying this little guy
bought for my son and he love it fast and great for playing game
not very fancy but not slow if you have amazon prime you have a access to a great library of tv show and movie for free same go for free book rental the amazon app store is not so great lot of apps are outdated but still work just not the latest version you would expect but the amazon underground appstore doe offer free access to game you would normally pay for it is decent for it is price and a good deal if you do not want anything fancy
performs a expected appreciate the posting of new skill
love this kindle excellent price i just carry it everywhere fit perfectly in my purse
very nice tablet very fast for the price camera take good quality picture
i gave the echo to two of my friend they were impressed with alexa and her instant answer to any question that were asked they also liked the instant access to music from amazon prime
nice tablet with good speed and nice assortment of feature good for kid with le than a need for a laptop
i bought this product to add to my tv in the family room great buy
i am very impressed with this set up i purchased a a cheaper replacement of an apple product and it doe exactly the same thing

it is a great product very reasonable price doe exactly what my kid need it to do
bought for my mother in law and she ha not had any issue with it run her game and internet browser fine
i bought more than of these for our kid and they were worth it
no glare ever easy process of getting book reading is made super easy
best price i have seen on a tablet that doe all what i needed it to do just simple thing
amazon tap pretty much work a advertised and understand that the product will evolve with system update love how the weather traffic movie and sport sres schedule are answered quickly and effortlessly this wa an excellent gift a i gave it to both my son and daughter and my son unknowingly gave we a tap back a well cannot wait to see what improvement are made with the update ming
this unit is great it ha everything that i need in it plus more it is fast and responsive with great voice regnition the uhd ntent is awesome
i suggest this to anyone looking to watch netflix and hulu simple
i love it quick for information and have started nverting mponents in the house to smart home setup
bought a firestick and the box the same day the box ha larger memory so i do not have to worry about clearing my cache a often
well not a good a i thought but work fine for my child

picked this item up while on sale to ntrol all my nest phillips hue light ha a much better voice regnition than siri
i purchased for christmas gift kid are loving so far
this tablet is good to browse the web check email watch youtube video the screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone it is a bit slow but it is a good bang for the buck big drawback no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your tv
well worth the upgrade performance of ui and app ha been significantly improved voice remote with alexa is extremely nvenient ui summarizes available ntent by streaming platform which is extremely helpful would remmend over other platform especially if you are an amazon prime customer
this is a great product if you have kid the apps and kid stuff is great
nothing flashy if you want something simple that you can just grab and go use with baby toddler throw around etc then this tablet is great if you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive model
love it had the stick and it wa kinda slow navigating this one is much faster wa going to use this and cancel cable when i told my cable mpany i wanted to cancel and i wa just going to stream everything they cut my bundle st by i kept cable but i also still use my firetv alot

i have bought mxiii andriod box and ouya but the amazon fire tv box is far superior than those i love the ease of adding the kodi app just google how to install it on this amazon box and it wa quite simple even ha a step by step you tube video
good product that doe the basic too bad you have to buy a specific light ntrol or security system to make this useful my smart tv is are connected to the internet so why not ntrol them too but i wa impressed when i asked alexa whats on tv for the olympics tonight and the response wa swimming at xx time gymnastics at yy time far more info than the tv guide on screen showing only a hour block on nbc it is the beginning of thing to me
have not yet received it yet but i am sure it will be great a i wa assure if wa what i would need to go with my kindle voyage reader to recharge it i am anxiously awaiting for the arrival of my reader so i can start getting book to read sincerely judiemae
i bought this to replace an aging apple tv and have been very pleasantly surprised with it it stream in k which my apple tv did not do and i have kodi installed to stream medium from a home server to my tv great product and worth the money
bought the fire tv over the fire stick due to the fact that it ha more memory great for streaming only problem is that it freeze sometimes and you have to hard reset it
nothing but problem after a month luckily i uld take it back and get a credit for the kindle to put towards an ipad it started off working fine then after a month it started losing internet connection randomly while the old ipad had no problem then it stopped charging never got past tried different outlet different android charger nothing worthless
my first kindle but the backlight feature is great
my kid love it and use it for everything including their homework it is really a great mpanion
i would go for the echo because you cannotalk to it the tap you have to touch it before you cannotalk to it the speaker is good though for it is size
i bought this last year for xmas love it so much i bought another and i also bought the hd version
live where there is not good cable provider or even satellite provider directv here on the ast of puerto ri is spotty at best forget about it when it rain which is daily in some season the firetv work great with the g wireless hotspot i use
this product ha exceeded my expectation great quality and design the prize is unbelievable for a tablet of it kind
the amazon fire hd model is a great tablet for the price however the fire o offer limited ability to the user personally i wish there were way to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a fire tv streaming stick also the inability to use the google play store is a major set back if it were notfor those two mplaint i d give this tablet star
i use this for video the quality is great i use headset the speaker is good for quiet place not to loud
got the tablet for my daughter for her birthday tablet worked great but the charger cable did not work
i use it in my mmute to watch video this serf the purpose for me pro cheap handy good for kidsns slow if we have multiple thing running gb is not sufficient this ha amazon store which doe not have all apps
gave this a a gift and i have to say it doe everything he want a tablet to do win win
bought this for my year old totally no tech mom her first e book is gone with the wind she like the size and ease of use
i purchased this to watch amazon prime programing and playstation vue this is way faster than the fire stick although i still have occasional glitch i cannot for sure say it from the fire tv versus the service
did not care for this product had difficulty downloading some aps
this replaced a paper white that wa several year old and acting up i love the paper white because i can read them anytime anywhere
i retired an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meet my need and the battery last so much longer
can be educational and lot of fun too a variety of u for alexa
amazon is free time is a great tool for parent making this a very good tablet for young kid you can ntrol when the kindle turn off at night and when it can be turned on in the morning you can ntrol how many hour it can be used before shutting down or you can specify hour by activity book video and apps game you can even set goal such a hour of book before allowing video and game and you ntrol exactly what ntent they can access and when your kid is not using it you can use it yourself with your own unrestricted profile
having owned each of the previous kindle reader this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch i highly remmend that the serious reader nsider this device do note that this is a reader not a tablet grab an ipad or kindle fire for your tablet need but get this to read book the high dot per inch unt make it easy on the eye a doe the evenly distributed light superb device
love this product the olest thing i have ever seen when elexa listens to my demand and play what i want to listen to is pretty ol everyone need one
picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage love that it is battery powered never had an issue of it running out of juice the only issue i have is with the mics it doe not respond to your voice a well a the echo or dot then again it wa not really designed to listen for the alexa mmand since it originally required you to tap the speaker to get it to listen
i bought this for an employee of mine she love it it is light mpact and allows her to carry ton of book with her she is huge book reader so this is a must for anyone that is a big reader she always think it is really easy to read also with the white background
i really enjoy reading so much so i wa running out of shelf space i have read a few book with my i pad mini but it really didndo the trick no so with my new amazon fire hd handy sized not the least bit heavy and super bright add in the face that digital material from magazine to novel are often a not far cheaper that hard pie
bought this unit a a door price at work my fellow employee went banana when they seen this a a prize option last x ma i gave away the fire stick and that wa a big hit
bought this for my sister and she love it much easier to read from than an ipad

this is a great tablet for the price work great and is easy to operate

excellent e reader with great download ability i really do not need the g a most of my downloads are through my pc

i have not had my fire long enough to have explored all it ha to offer i have downloaded a uple of audio book that sound great and are easy to install and play not my way to watch movie or tv but the screen is nice very clear and sharp audio is just ok from the speaker you ll want some nice head phone or bud for music or movie i really like the fire it seems like a lot of gadget for the money
the echo work great and the sound is excellent in addition to our household we gave it a a gift to our kid family and everyone love it
i have had a previous kindle before and it needed to be replaced i m glad i put it off until this gem happened to me out i still cannot believe that for the price of a random often low quality tablet done that too you get a kindle yes it is a smaller screen and not quite hd like i have been spoiled with but the resolution is still fantastic the speed is amazing and customer service if it need to be looked at ha a turn around of day i had a minor issue with preparing of microsd apps being slow but i just decided to deal with it
i purchased this a a christmas gift for my daughter she love it easy to use speaker are more clear than her other device great volume

the amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader prior to owning this tablet i had a uple of pw is which are great tablet in their own right my wife knew that i had my eye on the kindle voyage but i wa waiting to catch it during one of amazon is rare sale event unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for father is day and i planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after mparing it to my pw side by side i decided i uld not wait for it to get cheaper and so i kept it the pw is a great ereader ended up giving it to my oldest son but the voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter it is also a uple of ounce lighter and slimmer is it worth the upgrade definitely if you can get it on sale usually at well that is up to you obviously i paid full freight and i do not regret it much with that being said the pw is worth a look too same ppi clarity but usually to cheaper the voyage ha a bezel that is flush with it is glass so it is not the crumb catcher paperwhite is but hey maybe you want to skip eating while you re reading and save the dough
amazon fire tv the only way to go love mine better than apple tv

bought this on sale during black friday disappointed that there are not more apps available will be returning
i can read just about any book that is published and not leave my house to go to the store and have to buy them
once you learn how to use it it is fun to have this is a bunch of junk that you have to enter so many character to make this right
the image quality is nice but the speed is much better than the fire stick increased ram is always a plus
i purchased this amazon kindle fire for my mother she is new to technology and love this tablet
the amazon echo is a great product we got it when it wa on sale and liked how new feature are nstantly added we use it often for weather news turning on our light setting multiple oking timer and more it quickly became something we use daily
i have bought several kindle fire is over the year i think they are great for streaming movie video you can downloaded movie on the device and use it while off wi fi
i had a st gen fire battery started getting week after year bought this a a replacement i like the expandable sd slot and the camera much better than the first at of the price

love this alexa is so ol you feel like you re living in the jettsons
my kindle is a great addition to my kindle family i now have two that i use and enjoy
i would remmend this excellent amazon fire tablet product
love my new echo ask it question get the answer want music tell it and you get it sound is really good and listening to my voice is very good
alexa is a great device the only drawback is not being able to simultaneously stream all device throughout the house hopefully amazon is working on a solution
very useful and easy to navigate def remmend to anyone who love to stream
my kid love it but if you have ti many apps on the tablet it wonwork until you free up some space
uld not ask for much more performs smoothly expandable memory durable inexpensive and purchased thru best buy so all in all out of
doe exactly what it is supposed to do
love this product a it help make my home into a smart home with added security
the tablet is just what a child need it is tuff and the ntent is aimed at the child is need it keep them entertained a long a you will let them
alexa is getting smarter and gaining a sense of humor a well similar to siri the speaker sound great and alexa curate the music of our chosen genre in the house all the time
up front i want to say that i actually returned the echo in lieu of the amazon dot they are both basically the same device but i did not need the extra powerful bluetooth speaker portion of it a i already have a great speaker at home which i hooked up to the dot and it work amazing if you dont already have a bluetooth speaker get the echo keep it simple neat and it a great omnidirectional speaker i am still amazed at how much power these little device hold i learn new way to interact with alexa every week and it make my life easier and more entertaining i highly remmend this in your home if you have kid my year old daughter now spends time asking alexa question when i am not available
i like it it is better than the apple mini plenty of apps
better than mmercials used for holiday party everyone tried it out and a few bought one for themselves
i have read book on my phone and ipad and kindle but rarely would read long due to disraction of other apps and email or uld not read outside because of glare well this product ha solved all my problem no distraction just read and read for hour now and can mfortably read outside or on the back end of our motorcylce if i want becasue no glare love it
i am able to read in any sort of light and able to change the font size
my son is very happy for this tablet that i gave him for christmas
bought this to cut the cable rd work better than i imagined highly remmend it
bought the tablet at a great price wish i would have gotten more
we were not expecting more than what we got in term of performance but good enough for simple browsing and video
this thing great i have it ntrol light my alarm system my thermostat it integrates with ifttt like a dream a well the only drawback is having to remember all of the mmand phrase verbatim sound quality is pretty decent unless you turn it out real loud
excellent value let me lug all my favorite book around and read whenever would not be without it
so far i have enjoyed all that the fire tv ha to offer and it functionality it is very responsive and load show movie music instantly the only thing that is annoying is that the remote will intermittently not work if i tap the remote take out then reinsert the battery it will work again i have tried replacing new battery with new battery with the same result not sure if it is a glitch with emitting diode signal from the remote to the unit it is not very frequent so i tend to over look it the unit and the remote will occasionally go through software update so i ll see if that take care of it first
love it i can stream all the stuff that i want to see catching up on the show that is no longer on tv is so ol i also have amazon prime so i can watch certain movie best purchase ever
i bought this for christmas and my year old love it
bought the device a a gift for someone and so cannot mment on the usage however it wa a good price for a device that seems very versatile to me
great for a first tablet needed something larger than my phone and it me in handy when the grandkids visit
great option to take your library on the go without multiple distraction that me with a tablet
speaker is pretty loud and i love that i cannotake with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa
i love the fire tv for so many reason it is easy to take along anywhere and you can easily add apps no need for cable
you get what you pay for a small tablet with ok spec what wa annoying about this tablet wa the fact that you have to pay to remove offer you should not have to pay to remove bloatware
perfect for reading book better than ipad because of the front lit screen
it ha a good picture low price used for vacation ndo
love my fire easy to download book and is a great tablet for being so small price is right too
great beginner tablet not too small but not that big either
nice mpact size white screen make it easier to read
this fire tablet is great doe all i want it to only down side the battery only last a few hour and ha to be recharged often i like to read sometimes while reading have to stop and recharge otherwise i love it
love that it is so small it fit in my purse i wish i uld have gotten a different lor
i have owned one of the original kindle for year and love it in fact i handed it down to my daughter i just thought it would be nice to own the newest version with the built in light the other thing i nsidered wa the weight i love my new kindle a much a i have loved my old one
my grandkids love this tablet very easy to use and navigate through best buy wa awesome because after we bought the tablet they were on sale at another store and best buy refunded the difference
this is so much faster than my old blueray player loading apps and streaming work great and so many option
thus wa purchased a a gift for a friend do not know how well it work n
smooth and quick operarion ap store for amazon uld be better but pretty good value for the price
good enough for the price great for amazon subscription and amazon shopping
i got the echo on black friday and uld not be happier she doe not understand some thing but she is useful with what she doe know i use mine via bluetooth on my iphone and have her take the ntrols i like listening to podcasts on my echo a well and when i wake up she is ready to tell me the weather and any news update would remmend to anyone looking into a smart device like the echo
i thought alexa wa like your smart phone siri but it is not it is very limited to what you can ask and you must download some of the apps in within the alexa app to work and ask question not what i though it wa
the echo is a very good addition to our home very easy to use setup wa a bit of challenge to get to my wifi but once i understood i am what it wa trying to do it went smooth and easy we have had a few really good laugh a we put it through some pace but really glad we made the purchase
set up really easy we cancelled cable right away still figuring out which apps are for u got antenna for local channel

i love my amazon fire tv i canceled my directv and replaced it with the fire tv i saved month
i own a fire tablet and bought this for my grandson for christmas a he always u mine he love to play game on it he is and it is easy for him to use
it wa a great present for my grandma it is very easy to use
doe everything we need light and portable bought and no mplaints
i really like this product the kid can play all their game on it even minecraft and they are really enjoying them the one drawback wa that it wa hard to get them set up for each person with the parental ntrols you really had to fiddle with it to figure that part out
my son love it he want to get the card for expanding memory it is a real good value and work great
great sound love all of the thing that connect with the echo i use philip hue for turning off on lightswish it had a built in battery like the tap doe
great bargain for money easy to read in sunlight and while laying in bed
this a great product for the price the amazon benefit alone would have made the an excellent deal but this is a great low end tablet a well
i bought one for my year old son for his birthday and now we are buying another one for our ten year old we have had some tech issue a we are juggling three tablet on one acunt but with careful monitoring it is ok
i have several kindles so knew what to expect it is a great reading device and i keep several in different location
very nice ereader a big step up from the basic reader that i started with
i have bought several version of this tablet for my kid over the year and have been ever impressed with it i first got one for my son the my oldest daughter to replace her child is tablet which wa worthless this tablet give you everything you uld want and allows you to ntrol what your kid access on it and even let you see what they download onto it if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can when they can play game or use netflixs you can great product
it a great thing to get all the information i want really quickly and easy i love my alexa
this tablet i use for reading a well a free game
this is the third vizio tv i have had all still working even after nine year of almost ntinuous service
we love asking alexa stupid question and it nice to just say what you want to listen to and it doe it
i love everything except that it is not mpatible with itunes
a week after my purchase this item went on sale i think best buy should refund he difference without me having to drive minute way to return and repurchase a the store advised when i call them it is not like you do not have my credit card information
easy to use and great value excellent viewing with good lor
purchased this to mainly read book after my nook died cannot beat the price but the print quality is not a good a some other tablet it is more like black on grey a oppose to crisp white it can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablet
this is a good tablet the only thing that would make it better is it being hd
we love our alexa mainly used to set timer alarm and listening to music we have had four month and no major mplaints amazon updating new mmands often only reason star is the ability to pick up voice we have to be rather close for alexa to respond to u my year old son literally ha to be right next to her for alexa to pick up in his mmands other than that work great and fun
this is a great little kid tablet ha a lot of feature and is really fun to use
i had bought one for my bedroom back in december of and bought another one for my living room i am a rd cutter and have zero mplaints about this product i have amazon prime a well so that add even more to the amount of show i can watch love it
it is a fine tablet for the price the only problem i have with theach kid mode it is not what i wa thought it is going to be i returned it back just be of this reason
great product easy to use new update to the ui is really nice too
thus device is so portable and work really well for what i want it to

i wa excited to purchase the amazon echo but when i thought that i uld carry it out on the beach i wa a little disappointed if it had the capability to have a battery life to use without being plugged up it would be excellent
this is an amazing product doe not matter if u buy for a kid or an adult either one will absolutely love it i have totally remmend it
set up is simple and more useful than i imagined i added amazon music so i can listen to virtually anything i think of or hear some new tune

i purchased this a a gift for my great aunt it is easy to use and light enough for her to carry around
i love the ease with which i wa able to set up and connect alexa to the internet in my home i set an alarm to get up to go to the gym a reminder for thing ask her the weather and she wake me with the trivia of the day which is sometimes very amusing i also ask her the news the weather and what is on my calendar for the day every day i try something new and am always delighted with her and amazed by each new attribute of my echo i have a dot in my bedroom a well and plan to add one to my home office i think i m beming addicted to these wonderful and helpful unit
i had wanted a fire for about year but didnpick one up but this time i did wa not what i thought it would be like
i have sat on my back deck and in the bright sunshine on a beach and had no issue seeing the print never thought i d like an e reader only a real paperback book but i must say i am sold very lightweight

it is very high quality device it is easy to set up and very easy to operate it is a lot of fun
great box i like all the feature for ithighly remend
installed easily however little documentation for total setup and individual preference load of feature and u would be nice if documentation wa included with purchase however how to book can be found in the internet
sometimes you have to be very specific on where to find the information for example if alexa doe not know the answer i have to tell her to look in wikimedia
this is the send amazon fire tablet i have purchased this time in a lor other than black this like the first ha met all my expectation
very easy to set up and easy to use for grandkids love the ease of use and the amount of information the echo can be used for
the amazon echo is a great tool and ha a ton of ol feature amazon is nstantly adding feature and tip trick to use with alexa i like having my prime music playlist going it is very handy when i m backing and need to ask a question and my hand are dirty to use my phone to google what i do not like is that it ha to be plugged in the entire time you will need to purchase a remote to use it in another room hopefully they ll fix this with a newer model
it a little expensive but is a good product i will remmend this one over the amazon tv stick
many improvement than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life
the fire is a good handy tablet so far i have not been able to download a document from something other than amazon the document i am trying to download is the reason i bought fire in the first place
i have been a user of roku and apple tv before and i absolutely love the fire tv what prompted me to change from roku wa the availability of playstation vue we are rd cutter and vue is a better value than sling tv the fire tv work well and ha most all the channel we used on our old roku the only thing that doe not work is vudu or other ultraviolet streaming service the closest thing is flixster but some of the title do not carry over right away most of the movie me through just fine but the flixster app on the fire tv doe not seem to bring over the tv show i have purchased other than that it work very well of urse if you watch a lot of prime tv or use amazon is instant video service you will really love the integration here

pretty good tablet especially if you have prime
and this is amazing blow apple tv out of the water with all the customizations especially kody i have every apple product that currently exists including all their mputers however i will be replacing all my th gen apple tv with the fire tv
the amazon echo is a great product the only thing is that it doe not work properly when the tv volume is a little high

this product is great and user friendly it is easily accessible and ha plenty of apps and channel to watch
this thing is garbage do not buy it is the slowest charger i have every had it is not a fast charger it is a disgrace that amazon is offering this product a a fast charger and disntinued the previous all black square blocky fast charger which really wa a fast charger this thing is not a fast charger save your money amazon need to seriously check their supplier the manufacturer of this junk advertising this thing a a fast charger is totally deceptive
the fire make easy reading i also love the internet capability and the apps that i can access with ease the horizontal book format for reading make it even better to read through each book i receive my email quickly wherever i may be a long a i am connected to wifi i would remmend the fire to anyone and the personnel at the beat buy store were very knowledgeable about this product and helped me a great deal through the buying process
i enjoy many of the option reading email etc very unhappy about the ad that hit you in the face first thing i m even more disappointed that i must pay to remove them

great addition to my older dumb samsung tv i m an amazon prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch prime video another great feature is the ability to load and use playstation vue app to stream cable television which ha allowed me to disntinue my overpriced satellite tv service my only n wa that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the button were rendered useless resetting the unit help but very annoying luckily there is a fire tv app for mobile device for remote ntrol overall i do remmend this product

i am extremely pleased with my kindle voyage it life up to the hype it is slightly smaller and lighter than the previous version the ambient light monitor work well text is clear and very readable my only negative mment would be that the battery doe not seem to last a long a i expected i have recently retired so i am reading more i recharge the reader about every week and a half that said i am reading indoors and perhaps the ambient backlighting is on more than normal
opened it to test it out we decided to keep it awesome
i use it almost every day the battery last longer than i think
spending money on the cheaper one with ad is worth it the ad only pop up when you first turn it on and that is it have not had any issue with it in the few week we have had it
great tablet perfect for my son he can have all his game great performance
i got this kindle so that student i work with uld use bloxels this is an app that go with a physical board that allows child to create their own video game the kindle is certainly sufficient for the task and ha stood up to about early elementary aged student use

my daughter love playing with this there are so many feature that it keep her busy
i bought this for my wife who is an avid reader and she love it more than her last one
great performance for the money however if you are looking to read in bright sunlight it is not ideal
i had previously purchased one for our family and when they went on sale i purchased one for my daughter everyday i find something new to use it for
perfect reader low back light mean no eye fatigue uld read all day and night if anyone wrote something new and interesting
so simple and easy to u se it answer a multitude of question and play my favorite music portable and unobtrusive when not in use
i need more learning but i m ming along sirii is better music is great on the echo
i recently bought my fourth kindle i bought it because it is familiar and while there are improvement the keyboard is still difficult and not accurate i also do not like the auto rrect especially when writing a document browsing is quite good but i am a aol user and kindle make it difficult to use i definitely would like to see some improvement with making it easier to print
best deal i have seen online i checked amazon and they were not a good
family love it kid use it to play favorite song we have it hooked up to light and there is much more it can do

this is my favorite piece of technology in my home right now i love how it connects to my phone play music look up location track my workout and find recipe plus it nstantly update
really nice tablet full of ntent when using amazon prime acunt great gift for any holiday or birthday
i gave it away it wa too nice for me the person i gave it to wa gleeful
wonderful kindle i have been reading a lot of thing that i now can reach
after rooting and placing play store on it i liked it more not bad for the price
good product make life easy i have no issue so far with this
i m super impressed with alexa and how easy it wa literally out of the box and connect to wifi and done
amazon kindle need to put more effort in their tablet not a lot of application mpatible with the amazon o but for dlls is totally worth
amazon is voice activated smart home speaker is undeniably futuristic but it is also practical and accessible with a rapidly growing slate of feature integration and use case it is easy to get excited about the echo is potential
i am definitely a book person but this is really nvenient for travel
straight out of the box it wa so easy plug and play voice prompt worked great
this tablet is great for young child our kid got them for christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out i would remmend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space run out fast
better than i thought easy to set up small enough where it dosent take up much room and sound is good
it work very well for a small black box on my ncil
i bought of these for my niece nephew they think i m awesome now i d say they were definitely worth the purchase
easy set up and amazing usefulness love it i use it all the time and ntinue to find new way to take advantage of all there is within alexa will purchase another one for bedroom
this little device is impressive easy to install and simple to navigate i own both the fire tv and the fire stick the fire tv is slightly quicker at responding to input but not so much that it is a deal breaker the stick is great for taking with you on the road both device are a great value no mplaints whatsoever
i got it earlier than scheduled very happy with the purchase
easy to use and can put parental block on it so that the kid do not get into what they should not
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kid and there is no way that i have found searching setting or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keep playing if the child hit the screen this mean lot of time helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated
i have slowly started to smartify my house alexa doe great with the smart switch and plug i have in the house it make it very nvenient when you have your hand full when first getting home
great product a much better alternative to the fire stick which is slightly cheaper stream better le buffer period and mpatible with all program i have used on it great purchase
this tablet is a great buy at it is price point and is the perfect entry level tablet the kindle app is flawless and reading on the fire is a pleasure
i got this for sister is son who is enjoying it so far with the apps and game
i have three amazon product this a well a a kindle and fire stick this fire tv ha the advantage because of the ethernet port offer fox go for the yankee but still no twc mpatibility which is why it get star out of
great for online ntent such a movie tv show music and game from the amazon online store a well a streaming stored ntent from networked pc or na box you can also side load application such a kodi for online ntent if you nsider getting rid of cable television i gave it star because even though it will allow for high definition video and theater surround sound mpeting product can do those better
i do not know how my household ran without my alexa she ha beme a member of our family
easy to use tablet price is pretty good my mom love it
bought a a gift for a disabled relative she love it
alexa look great in my ciunter she responds quickly ti my request im sure amazin will be adding more feature innthe near future at least i hope so
this is one great tablet i download book from my local library and read them on the go i love the wifi and everything about this tablet i only paid for it but it is awesome
this tablet ha been great for my three year old only mplaint is that you cannot turn off the app download function on free time or see a mplete list of what ha been downloaded
i wa quite surprised by the ease with of setting this up the voice ntrol with alexa work great far exceeded my expectation great picture quality and a good selection of show and movie
i got this tablet for my son witch it work great for him it doe have some issue but nothing i can live with it like to disnnect ftom the internet once in awhile and sometime you have to rest it to make youtube work but overall for the price you cannot mplain great buy
great product and service will refer to a friend and the sale man r good

got it for during black friday i also have inch fire tablet for few more buck this tablet is way better than the inch non hd fire
kindle is still the top ereader my first one finally wore out from year of daily use it wa so light to hold and to travel with battery life wa great and it wa so easy to read in daylight this updated model is so much better the backlight is a great improvement and is such a delight to use at night while reading in bed this basic model is really all you need for reading book
i got this for my x ma gift for myself it is good up to now very easy to carry and eye do not feel tired after reading
bought this a a gift my kid and i have these at home and love them my usin love it a much a we do
this tablet meet my need for going online or killing time when i m bored the battery hold longer than my cell phone the only problem with these is that the port you connect the charger into is not aligned easily and is pretty cheap i can see how the tip of the charger would break easily that is really my only mplaint since i only paid dollar when it wa on sale
own a few dot needed this for office area the speaker is amazing and you can feel the quality alexa is here to stay
would not buy it at full price got it half price on a promotion enjoyed it speaker sound ok i enjoyed it music more when connecting to my external bluetooth speaker taught alexa to turn on and off power switch wish there were more skill alexa can learn i have nd thought about making purchase with alexa because i read people having issue with amazon vendor when ordering with alexa and automatic payment
the reader is great with a crisp display and excellent battery life i like having the option of either using the button to flip page or just swipe it the latter always required two hand so the button can make it easier
bought this a a gift my mother like it it is easy and simple to use
this product is great it allows me to watch whatever i want to watch from old tv show to movie in the theater i love this product
very easy to set up and the whole family is have alot of fun with this great product

this kindle is amazing it is extremely readable in any ndition bright light or dark the auto dimming function is super and the size and weight is amazing
easy to use with all the functionality she need perfect size for her little hand
this is not appreciably faster than any other or higher amp charger when used with my kindle kindle fire kindle fire hd various android tablet and other device that have usb charging cable it also block an adjacent outlet why didnthey put the plug on the short end like the original black and white kindle chargerit is an exceptionally good deal when purchased together with a kindle fire hd on promotion but the regular price is not mpetitive for a supposedly premium charger additionally it doe not me with a cable an omission that many people wonrealize edit i appreciate the many mments but amazon promotes this charger a something that charge faster than other charger but i have not seen any such advantage at promotional price it is a good deal but not at almost twenty dollar otherwise look elsewhere edit when the review wa written the description of the item did not have this statement optimized for kindle tablet powerfast is a w charger and will charge your kindle tablet faster than the white w kindle charger will that line wa added a nsiderable amount of time after i wrote my review
i got this a a gift to my inlaws this is very handy and easy to use they love it so much
t r a is h
i had been reading on my ipad mini most of the time but around the pool or at the beach that wa almost impossible the voyage is great not only in bright sunshine but inside even in a pretty dark room the back light is great for just about any environment the battery life is fantastic
this is a good product for reading and browsing internet
the paper white can hold many book which is great for traveling the back light is easy on the eye
this box is wonderful meet my expectation plus some i gave up cable and tried it i do not watch a lot of movie but this box me with a lot of selection in my opinion more than basic cable and if you have prime even more selection there a lot of free show just download the apps for them
it is not really an android device a everything is amazon centric not a massive problem unless you want to integrate with google product such a chromecast you also cannot switch off tracking feature and use add blocker the lock screen even ha an advert however if you can put up with that then it is a great little tablet with excellent performance
excellent purchase and easy to set up great entertainment nsole
it is pretty good for what it is designed to do a portable bluetooth speaker and alexa enabled speaker not voice ntrolled so you have to touch the speaker button for alexa nice thing once connected to your alexa acunt is that you can play music whatever without having your phone nearby though alexa only work when connected to wifi if no wifi then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps battery life is also pretty good
i like how it play music it is perfect to connect to smart home product such a nest belkin and many others it is easy to use
my daughter love her tablet i uld not have made a better purchase
player ha plenty of feature and the picture quality is excellent would have been star except the remote ntrol is on the cheap side
i enjoy all the feature on the fire tablet
i bought it for my wife to use mainly for news music around the house i have not tried the other automation feature i wa expecting a little better audio sound but it is ok again i am using it at about of capability hence review is inmplete but enough to give it a star
i am very satisfied with it it is exactly what i wa looking for
no prob loved it highly remmend easy to transport great graphic
i bought this a a replacement for my wife is old kindle g i got the wifi version only since she rarely used the g i have to say that this version is much nicer in some way and is lacking in others my wife really miss the physical keyboard but she ha quickly gotten used to the touch screen the dpi is much better and the screen is much easier to read the refresh time are a lot better i do not see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working but you should not hesitate if you re in the market for an excellent e book reader
easy on the eye and perfect for travel battery life is a
amazing battery life and beautiful screen my friend i are all like it
i love my echo i m a year old widow and i have echo and dot in various room i can listen to audio book in the kitchen when i m oking and eating or in the laundry room i play jeopardy and listen to untry and western music at night when i m trying to doze off i tell alexa to play music to help me relax and go to sleep i tell her to wake me up at a certain time and then i ask what is on my calendar for that day
sound is great voice ntrol excellent and work with other ambient noise great for music fact news and general info
love it had roku and this replaced all of them would high remmend this over fire stick faster and can add extra memory cut cable and use this a our primary tv source along with antenna for local channel kid love a well very easy to use
i mostly bought this to give me amazon prime with hdr a it wa not available on my nvidia shield it doe a great job and ha excellent performance and speed with the menu and such very intuitive and easy to use that all said the nvidia shield received an update today that add amazon prime so it will probably beme my device of choice again
they just keep getting better my wife used her original kindle with a book light the lighting is so good on this one it is by by book light the battery life is amazing
i did my research and this wa the tablet i wanted it wa a smooth transaction the only thing wa that i uld not purchase it without special offer from anywhere other than amazon direct i opted to purchase it from best buy with special offer because of the price i wa pleasantly surprised to find out that i uld choose to have the special offer removed after purchase i had to pay additionally for this option but it uld be done none of the review i read mentioned that this wa possible i suppose this uld change this at any time but at the time i am writing this it is an option i saved delivery time by purchasing at best buy and paid minimally later to have the special offer removed
picture is great quick response when going from site to site sound is not so good but what i expected from a tablet
this is a great little tablet to carry around love that it is easy on my eye and ha very clear picture
this is my send kindle tablet and i uld not be any happier i primarily use my tablet to read mics they have the best mic reader on any device to read your cbz file miccat now that you can upgrade and add extra memory the price tag cannot be beat by rival mpanies great for the kid if they break it it is not a bad a breaking say an ipad at a minimum of dollar
fun to sit around and ask alexia question and getting her response
i already had a fire but it didnhave enough storage space this tablet solved that problem for me however i m unable to download dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different i did however figure out that i uld install one drive and then put my photo into that program otherwise it is a good tablet
i really love this product i remmend it to anyone who love gadget
i have one purchased this one for my mother in law she had a inch between the bigger screen and hd this one is much easier on her eye and she can use it for longer period of time without her eye bothering her
cannot beat the quality and performance of this tablet for i bought it to be my main link with my amazon prime but used it last week instead to download direct tv app so i uld use it to watch the fbs championship game it worked great but it uld not help my bama team win
this is a great tablet for a kid it is easy to use and play on
i wa so against getting one but finally caved this is so easy to use and i take it with my everywhereperfect for reading outside or on the train
the ultra ud the easy user interface well designed remote and the ability to add third party apps make this a must have
the fire hd is the perfect size ereader big enough to see the text but small enough to hold mfortably
i bought the tablet for my grandson for christmas it wa the best investment that i have made in all time he is learning so much that he cannot put it down a a matter of fact he sleep this it just about every night
this item wa on sale and i bought it cheaper than on amazon with the feature it is a great buy
this item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge we may have to return i assume it is this unit and not all
wa easy to use and easy to set up programming wa easy to do

bought this for my mom who is and her other fire deceased it wa very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her acunt information she ha really enjoyed using it and ha even started using some new apps due to her age and my not living closer it would be nice to be able to have a print py of how to do thing otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use

we bought this for my daughter she love it too much and it is the best tablet for the price
love this amazon did a great job with design for it
love the idea of it not a easy to put the dvd movie on it
i love the learning game that he doe not even realize they are learning game
we already have an echo so i didnthink we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it now we use it everyday mostly to stream amazon prime tunein or pandora channel it is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings u back to where we were when i wa a kid having a beat box to carry around room to room and outside we use the tap a a version of a beat box that is much smaller rechargeable and way easier to tune and with side benefit of ntrolling our light hvac and with alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia question the sound quality uld be a bit better but surprisingly good adjusting the volume is not a easy a it should be the battery last a long time and it a snap to use a bluetooth speaker a well
fun product that will be used more and more the longer you own it
i bought this to use with a particular app but wa not able to install them so i returned the tablet
this echo device is so handy you can also program it to turn light on and off in the house if you buy the extra accessory for it you can play music order take out ask it question it is really endless what you can do with it
we re enjoying alexa and her esoteric response very much
my son love it it doe have some flaw though when he close an app and then try to open it again sometimes it ha to download all over again also even though apps are supposed to work without wifi apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet
very nice for reading and watching video strong wi fi is a must slippery to hold so buy a ver
great ebook for a beginner light and good looking
for the price this is a great tablet kid friendly a easy to use
i love this device it very easy to use and make cable irrelevant
spend the extra money and get this instead of the firestick way more responsive the time saved scrolling the guide on p vue alon is worth it

amazon tv box ha got to be best bang for the buck no other device can match performance and price this offer great for gaming movie show and overall android platform
smart rapid response indispensable in any house in the future
the echo is a big part of our home life now and just getting all the wireless home device attached it is a keeper buy it
a very hot item that wa used for a charity raffle
good product but if you have the old paperwhite no need for upgrade in my opinion cause i noticed very little difference
this wa well received a wonderful upgrade from a first gen kindle
the only thing missing is sonos integration when amazon managed to allow for echo to be nected to an speaker system such a sonos this product will be deserving of a star it doe what is mean to do flawless
everything is ok with it it is my first tablet but it seems adaquate
i wanted this when i first heard about it my husband surprised me for my birthday it wa the best gift love love it
lot of fun it wa a gift they are enjoying it very much
this device is fun with all the different apps you can use great speaker quality too
i really enjoy this product the stumer service wa great on helping me pick the right item and explain it to me well i nt to have great experience at best buy
got this for one of our employee work well and you can see the print well good point is that it is small and mpact bad point is that it is small and mpact easy to carry around but more difficult to see word work great though great price too
overall good quality for the st ease of use functionality is beneficial and allows for great entertainment

i bought this for my daughter i like it all in all i wa unaware that it didnhave a google to do internet searching
this is super simple to set up and use the hardest part is using your tv provider info to gain access to some of the channel this requires a bit of patience since you have to log in and enter de and wait for email to acmplish
great tool to have around the house like a personal assistant at your finger tip

great christmas gift for a young adult she loved it
replacing my original white page kindle i love these reader like the new auto adjust backlight also like the new page turner slide on the side of the screen great product
look good work great and light enough to carry in your pocket would be much better if it would a mpaters nook app
i love the kindle fire this is my send i wore the first one out i got it to read book and love that i can pack all my favorite book to go all in one small tablet no more box of book to go camping also the larger print is easier on my eye and if i fall asleep ot shuts itself off
purchased it to watch stream movie and tv show on amazon wish i would had bought the k fire stick this is still a good stick
this wa my third fire to purchase one for me and two for gift the apps in the amazon appstore are not a numerous a in other store but i have got email apps game office productivity everything i need for a simple to use tablet it get the job done very well a an e book reader it is great but not outstanding the screen is not a nice a higher end model but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat the speaker is mono and not a loud a nicer fire unit but again this is a sub unit i use mine daily for email web some simple game i have even sideloaded a few apps that work great your mileage may vary expect to like the unit for what it can do and you ll be happy if you think this one is a good a a tablet well look elsewhere all the sub tablet i have seen out there cannot hold a candle to this one is build quality and feature
i bought this tablet for xmas gift grandson yr old had to go back to best buy to get more for the bigger kid age to
good for watching movie reading book and playing game but do not expect to do much more everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it ll just shut down a program or mpletely reboot
i have had this for about a month and so far it is all good the remote that i can speak into is ol and most of what i say is regnized rrectly by alexa i like that i can place amazon order this way if i feel the need the only n a of now is that the battery ver is hard a h ll to get off
ok i purchased this tablet specifically for my two year old for her birthday so far she love it but get tired of the kid included amazon trial video so i end up logging into my user acunt for her to be able to go on youtube but she really like and enjoys her new tablet over all it is a good tablet for kid what had me on purchasing this tablet wa the free no question asked replacement warranty she ha dropped it many time but the included foam case ha protected the tablet every time
this is a great tablet especially for the price we bought of them and gave them for christmas gift for family member
very good for an e reader doe everything i want it to
love my red otter box rtr protects my phone every time i drop it on the ground
great kindle the only mplaint i have so far is that it doe not have a charging light so that you know when it is charging or when it is fully charged
when you mpare it to the ipad it is a little small but you cannot beat the price for what you get shopping watching tv whatever you would do on your smartphone but much easier to see love it
bought this kindle for my aging mother it is our third she love it my daughter love hers a well easy to use even for someone in their is
this kindle wa purchased on the black friday sale at the time i felt it wa a steal at that price the first tablet i purchased a few year ago wa the original kindle fire the following year i purchased an ipad mini and now have the ipad mini a you may already know the ipad doe not have explandable memory this kindle can have expanded memory to gb so that wa a good selling point for me after setting this new kindle fire up i noticed that viewing photo were not a clear a the original ipad mini even without retina display and the lor had a greenish yellowish tint to it some may not notice this if they do not have something else to mpare it to i m a pro photographer so this wa quite unaceptable to me i wa not expecting perfection with the lors but people is skin tone appeared greenish a if they were vulcan i also like to read tech manual and magazine of which many are in pdf format the kindle will read this format but the kindle fire after all these year still cannot display the ver art from pdf book etc it display an acrobat pdf document logo instead if you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document title instead of being able to select by seeing the ver of the book that wa enough for me i have been spoiled by the ease of use of the ipad and the display with accurate lors back to the store for a prompt refund it went overall still a good deal but if you are used to an ipad for the reason i am you may be disappointed
this wa to replace an older fire tablet that wa worn out it wa the right size for my wife to carry around also it wa much lower price than the original
gave up on apple tv and tried this sucker out ha sling tv and plex among amazon prime so it is very good mpares to other streamer out there
it had apps he can use now and that will grow with him easy to navigate
gave a xmas gift and received very positive response
i have been a kindle fan for year because it doe so much more if you have amazon prime free movie free music free book etc the tablet ha a great picture is fast to search and last for year
my daycare love thsee tablet they have a lot of fun game on it
great device for streaming video you can side load kodi and different add ons to get movie and tv show for free
this is just perfect for my tween boy it is easy for him to use and play game on while we are driving in the car
we got this for the kid grandmother to keep her occupied and it is doing a great job at it she ha no mplaints and enjoys it
very good when using with vivant also good when you want need to know something like the weather
the value of this device is amazingâ the battery life uld use some work tho
wa skeptical about this until it went on sale and we finally bought it gretat for home automation and music only disappointment is that we uld not pair with another speaker
love this device enjoying everyday it in my home i actually purchased another one
bought for my year old good price and doe what she like
doe everything i thought it would do and then some bought one for my daughter and a friend too
i have really enjoyed binge watching show on netflix and exploring all the option i have with the fire stick
purchased one for my mother who like to read a lot but not really internet savy she love it and cannot beat the price she u it mainly for reading however i bought it on black friday for under
addons loaded very fast and wa very impressed with the processor speed would buy again
santa dropped this off for our th grader along with expanded memory he u it for netflix and youtube a well a minecraft and other apps why spend hundred on something for basic kid need i m sure this will last him a few year and is well worth the price
this tablet is very simple to use i wa happy that i uld basically open the box and start using it i have remmended it to my friend
nice size work fine need to weigh a little le
purchased a part of a bundle with a logitech remote not sure i would buy it alone the disunt wa too good to pa up i guess it is ol not sure how much i can do with it other than playing music and waking me up in the morning we ll see
best e reader yet the new voyage is much better then the first paperwhite which wa great
a an amazon prime medium nsumption device it can not be beat for the price if you are not a prime member do not bother put the fifty buck toward an ipad which cannot be topped for a medium device
my wife is an avid reader and ju st had surgery on her neck she is healing well but find it hard to hold the weight of a book i bought the kindle for her ad she love it because she read in bed and can easily handle it because it is so light she love that she can get book in french and any other language she want
this will be our send firetv and we love these
bought this for my mom the touchscreen is not a responsive a my ipad the camera is a little underpowered too i didnthink it would matter much but it is pretty pixelated it serf her purpose and i knew it wa not a high end device going in she ha been able to fumigate it out mostly so that is been a bonus
best purchase use it daily load fast great buy
truly enjoyed it meet customer need great for game reading and day to day usage
fast reliable easy to use best quad re processor
bought this for my adult son who is nfined to a bed due to m his caregiver can ask alexa to play pearl jam music and it there this is the send one we have plus we also have the dot
if your looking for a nice gift this holiday without breaking the bank this is it great responsive tablet with a nice screen good battery life and amazon echo system a true bargain
great feature we use it in the spare room and sometimes move it to the livingroom i love it
the new fire tv ha every streaming option that you cannothink of except vudu this is the only negative that we have found because we have over digital pie of movie that have been either purchased or came with the blue ray when we bought them it is very nvenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie the fire tv loses that nvenience in that amazon want you to use their prime service for digital movie if you are going to subscribe to amazon prime then look no further than the fire tv if you have a large digital movie llection then i d look to the roku
very happy with this kindle easy to set up and use all my book purchased previously on amazon came right down to the device now i m all set for vacation reading without a carry on full of book
love it my two year old love to watch sesame street football
functional but be sure the the usb cable is firmly installed in the base to get a connection
wa attracted by the low price and bought this item spontaneously when strolling at a bestbuy store perfect ereader tablet although an e ink screen type is more pleasant for your eye nevertheless for short reading it is ok
he play his game and we can put parental ntrols on this tablet
kindle fire is great for kid not only is there educational game but if they break it they are not that expensive to replace also with best buy you can get a replacement plan for them this is the only tablet we will be getting for the kid for now on
mpact great look without that super bright look of tablet that seems to strain my eye when reading for a while not much a far a tablet feature but a just an e reader this is the best out there for now
very good for kid good quality we uld not see any problem
wry basic but i guess it is ok for the price bought for a year old
i utilize my echo every morning a i get ready for work alexa help me decide what to wear with weather update which is the best route to take to work and all the while playing my fav tune
yes it is a very nice starter tablet i would think it will bring a lot enjoyment to the owner
i have two young son after their previous tablet broke i had to decide on which new one to replace it with there is a growing number of tablet and system to choose from for kid now having had previous experience with an amazon fire kid edition in the past it wa hard to ignore the many great feature that it provides although it lack google play this is ideal for kid
i do like the amazon fire tv there are a few thing i do not like mainly the layout of the menu amd getting around to many duplicate displayed and to many pay for show mixed in even with prime there are thing you have to pay for there is an option to see only prime but you have to set it each time and that blow they really need to work on thier menu
work well the kid love it can watch everything on it
i love it you can ask it anything and it will answer you you can keep up with your football team he can play the music that you like and music you have never heard so you can figure out if you do like it i found out today if hummingbird migrate you can ask it some very interesting question
font and lighting option enhance readability light weight and durable
this baby break the ice and set the mood for a date when you eventually bring her to your place they cannot get enough of alexa the music you can get her to play make your mpany feel relaxed alexa is thumb up with me
upgraded from a to kindle fire and it is so worth it great picture good storage love my kindle
i purchased the amazon fire tv because it give you the ability to use streaming apps like netflix hulu and many other android based program the amazon o and gui is excellent smooth and not mplicated the ability to use the microphone on the remote is perfect for anyone a it is very accurate and easy to use the video streaming is very good the processor and ram can give you smooth playback with any medium file you can play on it i highly remmend this box for anyone looking for a streaming device at a great price
i love everything about it it is portable sound better than most portable speaker and alexa rock it only thing that kept it from a star rating is that you have to manually activate alexa wish it would work like the echo and dot while it is on it base
like it ha a quad re processor but sad it doe not have google play store
i love this new tablet because it ha expandable memory
got tablet for my son a a christmas gift he will enjoy it a i have one myself
bought this a a mother day gift for mother in law she love it
i wa hesitant to buy this because i wa not sure how i wa going to use it i now use it everyday i listen to music ask question check the weather sport sres and more it is the greatest think ever i am just sorry i waited so long to get one
giving it an average rating because boo hoo i have not figured out how to make it work yet it responds but doe not seem to have answer to any of my query or request it must be just a matter of connecting it to a proper wireless source so far i have not figured it out i am eager to however i guess i am just too technologically challenged
bought for my year old son and he absolutely love it
extremely inexpensive wa shocked at the price i thought there must be a catch like i have to buy a membership for it to work i wa wrong downloaded apps the st day and started using it right away it perfect for my year old son to play with durable and wonscratch
love it i can carry it and use it anywhere i have already purchased more a gift my family really enjoyed getting them
did not work right out of the box bad hard drive read other review that stated the same issue would not remmend to anyone save your money
apps nstantly fail to open no flash for camera hard to download anything not amazon ie google apps will be returning
amazon echo is i great device to assist in home automation i use it to turn on light arm my security camera and set thermostat also great with amazon prime for music
great gift for the family and friend i have purchased several
great tablet thats ready right out of the packaging it me pre loaded with load of apps and ha a nice feel in the hand screen quality is nice the only thing i would like to see changed is the amount of time it take the kindle to start up and shut down it can get annoying at time i have a yo and yo and it held up great dropped on cement and no crack
i have three of these they re great but for how far along this product is there is still a lot it cannot do and some of the thing it can do only function after a very specific mmand that being said there is a lot it can do especially via third party apps yea some of the skill are useless but it is worth the money for a smart home purchase
i purchased two of these on black friday what a great purchase these are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many thing for the kid i later bought tough case to keep any damage minimal
overall this is a good tablet it is best with those who have prime amazon and the ability to watch amazon video a good price for a good tablet but ha limitation based on the operating system for video watching and basic use a good choice
so many different way to use the fire i have just begun to learn some of the function
feel it should have me with paperwhite kindle and that i should not have had to buy it
bestbuy had this echo for sale at half it is regular price we bought one and are having all kind of interesting fun imagine when your hand are full and you say alexa set timer not to mention all the other request that may me up use you imagination
good product but alexa doe not know all the answer
i purchased this a a gift but wa told by the person that i gave it to that they loved it
this is a good hand free product i like being able to ask it question and have it play the music i want to listen to
nice toy in the future when i get more accessory to work with it will be more rewarding
bought this for my son the size is perfect not too small not too big kid friendly and easy to use overall o rate it star no problem to list
bought for my yr old grandson and he love it ha a lot of learning number alphabet and shape
doe not allow for my apps but with memory card it will
have a few issue not sure if it my set up in my home automation maybe it is just me but overall fantastic job by amazon
awesome tablet at a good price i love the size of the tablet
very pleased i purchased echo dot but not really happy with speaker so far very ok
this charger is produced by amazon and backed by it excellent quality ntrol and manufacturing process
easy to navigate great for kid and adult parental ntrol feature love a tablet and ereader in one

work a intended great inexpensive reader very nvenient for reading at home or traveling when do not have the extra space for book the kid i both use it and i can separate our book so they re not mixed together the only downside is the lack of lor but i knew this going in it is not the fault of the product we lose out a little bit by not being able to see the lor illustration and book vers when getting my kid to read the lorful vers is often what draw them in
great for weather time trivia and pandora radio alexia probably can do more but i do not have the time to study how

cannot beat the price and feature on this tablet all the feature are mpetitive even with amazon is proprietary operating system and appstore most mmon google play apps are available but if they re not chance are there is something analogous navigation can be a little cumbersome a it is not a customizable a some might like but bottom line is it is a pretty full feature tablet for fifty buck

it is a lot of fun to use with everyone in the family
husband love his alexa best gift ever perfect
it wa the cheapest tablet but still very useful nsidering it wa for my toddler wanted something that i uld play child show from youtube and some learning game from apps wish there were more apps for him but i m sure with time amazon will have a few more i d like to see just a apple doe when not in use from time to time it work great for the need i may have if i want a bigger screen than my iphone or do not feel like booting up a laptop the only downfall is that when it is locked it display ad for game i found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet
alexa is a very good tool to have in home the only thing is that sometimes we have to repeat question
very good value for the money quad re processor allows for nsistent streaming
excellent for avid reader this ha all the bell and whistle
i really love my echo i enjoy talking to alexa every day and getting the news trivia and podcasts i love that it is a bluetooth speaker and i can pair and play my phone or device easily the easy connection with other amazon device allows you to easily call someone in your contact i want another one
the paperwhite is a terrific e reader the text is clear the backlighting easy on the high and if urse ha a huge selection of book
my parent had a kindle paperwhite they were sharing and loved it so much they wanted another one so they would not have to take turn anymore unless you re looking for the full android experience with the fire or firehd this is the best kindle model the voyager model doe not add enough to justify it is higher st my tech adverse mother absolutely adores her paperwhite
the up grade where a very nice choice and better
i bought this to replace my kindle touch since kindle is no longer have speaker option it is good for reading but to small to be used a a primary tool
great product and i m in the process of cutting my cable tv
very user friendly and easy to set up i would remmend this to everyone especially amazon prime member a there are more option also no lagging time a i experienced with other streaming device
this wa a great price for a great tablet on black friday
it the best for apps movie game and morealso it support usb dvd drive for playback of dvd and support sling and playstation tv
i bought this after speaking with a sale rep in tigertown i bought this for my kid and he love it it my nd kindle
this product is great very fast and responsive and allows you to cutomize however you feel
this is great for reading book work well in sunlight

very lightweight lot of feature easy to read good software
super easy to set up and use got one for daughter and got one for self
i have bought several of these now one for me and they make great gift there really is not a mparable tablet in this price range i do not love amazon is ntrolling interface that keep you from downloading what you would with a regular android otherwise it work well for all my u and for those i have gifted with them i highly remmend them for the under price range tablet
i bought this a a christmas gift for my year old i wa a big hit i love the screen the price wa perfect for my budget
pretty dumb that you have to buy a charger port
my husband and i purchased the new amazon kindle fire hd tablet for our yr old son and yr old daughter for christmas i have an older version in myself so i already knew we were buying a durable tablet the new one are awesome and they had them in lors so very easy to distinguish who is is whom we purchased during black friday and got them for off which wa an amazing disunt and made me love it even more we had shopped around many place prior to and they are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movie play game do homework and video call friend and family out of town they seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to the tablet hold up to the everyday life of the kid accidental drop kick and their yr old sister lol would definitely remmend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or child will buy again in the future if these ever quick working
at it wa the best price for a small touch panel
great family christmas gift fun for the whole family
i uld not decide on which one to buy they all do the same thing but ended up buying the tap which is portable i take it on my deck with a cup of ffee and listen to the music i put in through pandora and iheart radio i absolutely love it and so doe my husband
this is a great product it work great and is fun to use
the echo work flawlessly and integrates with many online service that i use anyway i love it and use it daily
great gift for my mother who love her social medium and e book
i purchased this at christmas when they were on sale work great for what i need it for liked it so much bought two more for family
nd one i have purchased doe not run down charge quickly l
bought it a a gift for my mom and it is simple enough to get done what she need
everything i had read wa a bit nfusing on how the echo can ntrol it but low and behold it ha the alexa service built into it the echo cannot ntrol the amazon fire tv which wa the sole reason i bought it well also in hope that hbo now would have surround sound on it but of urse it didnso they re both at fault here and the reason why i returned it immediately since neither of the above worked this made the device mpletely redundant with my chromecast
purchased this for my yr old son glad i did this is not to much for him to handle he is reading playing game and he love it
my grand child love kid tablet and play with them every day and their mother is using them to teach the kid
i wanted a tablet that would actually work this also ha a good camera
best budget tablet out there ha not everything you need for someone who u a tablet here and there
i went to the store to buy an echo only to find out that it is a hot item this year and they were sold out a very nice young man helped me and ordered the item right away and had it delivered to me before christmas great customer service
wonderful inexpensive tablet for the novice or experienced person
my only mment the pre installed apps cannot be removed i purchased the gb model only about gb of storage available
i no longer have cable nor do i need it now that i have the firestick
no issue with the product i am a satisfied customer
i have to say upfront i do not like roporate hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case amazon i like having device on which i can put anything i want and use it but i wa a fairly happy user of a nook touch for several year but uld not use all it functionality since i live in serbia then i lost the nook and since no other device can actually be fully used in serbia buying book with them using their online capability except the kindle and since no one except amazon ship to serbia and since i have actually been a happy amazon customer since over friend acunts and since through my own and since the kindle definitely ha the best technology why not buy itso i did what i read in many review about the screen light of the paperwhite and similar device wa no problem with mine the light disperses just fine except a few black blotch maybe you can see it in the picture at the bottom of the screen which are actually shadow of the black plastic casing and thus cannot really be avoided a you can see in the picture without the light there are no blotch with light out the paperwhite is screen is just marvelous at ppi the touchscreen work just fine the store work here in serbia and in these two day i have been using it i m a happy guy i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded book behave at least almost like amazon book but that is fine that is the one thing i d like to see amazon do in some future upgrade make the kindle treat sideloaded book just like the one bought from them directly with sharing funcion quote and goodreads enabled and so on the size is perfect it sits very well in the hand the light doe not hurt the eye in the dark like the light on a tab doe the packaging wa fine no problem there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life so far i can only remmend it
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying book got stly with this product i can read all i want for a month
so far it work well i do not use it to ntrol any light or smart device a i am in a temporary residence but it responds well and is clear it some time me on by itself
decided to purchase this on a friend remmendation and it w well worth it
if you re using an older kindle paperwhite model like i wa the higher resolution and additional font choice available in this model more than justify the upgrade st i d remmend the white case if you can get it it is a lot easier to find the microusb port when you re trying to plug in a charging cable
i purchased this for my mom day before christmas with day free shipping it arrived on time with no issue my mom love it she like to read digital book and watch netflix and this tablet allows her to do both she also love that it is small enough to fit in her purse and bluetooth capable
lot of fun music information weather alexa is like a new family member
this kindle is very slow at recharging granddaughter ha a hard time waiting for it to charge
this box work great it sure would be nice if it had the google play store on it
i love my kindle fire it doe exactly what i need it to do and more
bought this during black friday actually thursday ok for price but not ol i had to buy extra storage for not a great price
best streaming device out there very fast and responsive a bit more than fire stick but very well worth it
perfect gift great apps and reading material would buy it again
easy to setup quick delivery great for beginner user of technology
it literally speaks for it self it is awesome to have something update me on news and entertainment and the fact that it u spotify for music a well that is to awesome i got it on my birthday and told alexa the echo is name it wa and she said happy birthday that is show is how personal it can get then the other voice active product the speaker work almost to well i live in a story town house and the voice mmand can work a i m walking down stair just check the product out for yourself you will want one
i purchased this ereader because it stated you uld get library booksvia usb rd and wifi if you are near one i do not have wifi andthe usb would not transfer tried everything neighbor tried readinstructions viewed youtube but it would not work took it back but it wa beyond day and they would only give me credit i then upgraded to wifi g and that better work for the extra money very disappointed a i felt i had no other choice
i like this tablet i had a nook the fire ha more memory bigger screen and lower price the downside the amazon fire is so ridiculously proprietary that i cannot watch any of my movie on it from my nook this is beming industry standard too bad

bought this a a gift for my mother she absolutely love it easy to set up and use and the price wa right
i am able to see my directv netflix and amazon prime all in one system
this by far is one of the greatest tablet out there for kid st is affordable and there is a lot for them to do keep my year old busy in drs office lightweight and easy to use
my husband wanted this so he bought it we have had it for about month now and i do not really see a huge need for it it wa fun at first but i find that nobody really u it much now maybe if i took the time to research i may find it more interesting
i purchased two of these tablet a a gift for christmas it ha an exceptional hd screen which provides rich lors and make it easy for those that like to read book article etc
i remmend this product many movie and very clear
work great once i figured it out book are easy to download
alexa is so simple to set up and so fun to use we love it and use it all of the time we keep it in the kitchen so it is easily accessible
nothing really spectacular about this weird interface it is okay
i wa very impressed with my amazon fire tablet very good
there is no better e reader available today it sts a bit more but the build quality is the best
we use this device daily it is so easy to use and the sound is incredible we can hear itt clearly throughout sq foot home
love the size and quality easy to carry around and good screen quality
doe what it said on the fire tv not a bad device
decided to spend the extra money to get the model with more processing power for game other than the occasional heating up and the unit freezing it serf it purpose
very nice tablet for low price the shell feel a little on the cheap side but added a ver fintie feel much more sturdy great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video
this is my first tablet love it actually read my first e book on it large screen easy to read play game fit nicely in my purse

i brought the tablet for my step mom who is not very familiar with technology it wa easy for her to operate and a great price
wa a christmas gift for my daughter in llege so she ha not used it much yet but seems like it should be good for her
went in to look at the kindle fire and uld not resist the price on this one there wa not a big enough size difference to justify spending more than for the inch this ha been a great device so far battery life ease of use etc
kindle paperwhite is wonderful i am able to read in the sun
we bought it for my son but the whole family u it we really enjoy it
the fire is best used a a book reader but having the ability to check mail surf a bit etc is very nice for the price it cannot be beat
this speaker is awesome but just wished if you ask it question it knew more
the tablet is great for my year old to play on and i like that it ha parent ntrol on it
purchased a a reward for perfect attendance for middle school student this wa just what we and they wanted
if you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall and then plug the big end of the usb cable into the non prongy side and then plug the little end of the usb cable into your kindle it make book magically appear on the screen use your eye to read the word and your eye will transmit the information into your brain
i bought this tablet for my year old and he love it it keep him entertained when we go place and he ha learned so much the apps are great and perfect for him i would definitely remmend this tablet for a young child just learning to use a tablet
great screen and load speed is quick can watch movie and search on internet with out any problem
the whole family enjoys having alexa play music and other feature
work a expected very easy to use and doe not hurt my eye like a tablet would
usually a tablet is some cheap knockoff no name brand limited capability tablet for an amazon tablet you cannot beat the price if you re an amazon shopper user this ll be a great tablet for your kid an elderly adult in your care or you for or le if you catch it on sale i ll take the ad
i have not personslly used this item but it wa a requested gift for family member so they obviously were aware of benefit no mplaints so far so guess it is good
i like this tablet
good quality product clear display and easy to use
i have had several kindles this latest one just doesnt seem to be a good of quality a the previous onrs i have owned
i absolutely loved it it is the best thing that i have used since cable
echo is lot of fun and our friend will ask if alexa can me out hour and hour of entertainment
easy to use with great battery life and easy to read in all light nditions
i love this more than my apple tv it work well with plex and it all i need
tablet have me a long way this is much better than my piece of junk nextbook for the dollar i bought this for it is great and stay on wifi much better than my old tablet it is small enough to travel with and browse much faster online than what i used to use the sound quality is not bad and i will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this i have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire
me and my husband love them we bought for our kid and they love them so easy to use and the kid profile is great the tangerine is a great bright lor too
love the tablet mainly use for game and internet grrat product foe the price
i bought this for my niece and she love it she can read all the book she want and it is a perfect size
bought it on sale for christmas gift and we ll worth the money doe everything needed with good functionality easy to use for those not too tech savvy
i got this for my husband for his birthday he like the light weight and the speaker and how powerful it is
my wife and i are so happy with the range of function on this product that we bought one a a gift for her sister love the clear and crisp screen and ability to navigate easily
i have to admit that i am very pleased with my echo it wa easy to connect to my amazon prime acunt so we have been enjoying music around the kitchen it is amazingly easy to use the speaker is great and we are finding it much more than the gimmick i thought it would be we have enjoyed it so much that we added two dot one for each floor
simple to use best for kid cheap gift for distant relative and first time user
i think ok google can do the same or more i found annoying by saying amazon or other echo name repeatedly to get some answer if you get them may be in future i may try when it is more practical
i wore out my first generation paperwhite onto the next kindle paperwhites are the way to go
it would be better if it had a better camera it still a great tablet
great price easy surfing the web great game playing and way to enjoy reading new book gb is large enough i like i can purchase gift card to make purchase
i purchased the kindle fire after owning a for several year i love the bigger screen and added feature in this version
i gave this a a christmas present and they liked it
i like the fire tv because i can hook my lan cable to it
this wa purchased because every time i would try to stream something from my tv it would be laggy this solved my problem easy set up and user friendly
if you like to read and travel this is the answer to that problem you can read just about any paper in the untry at any time
easy to set up lot of free tv with this if you re an occasional tv watcher and pay for cable or sat service you just be able to ditch them and put the towards something else
we were tired of cable failure via mediam and we re looking for a cable and dish le tv system a friend of one of our friend told u about the fire system we went out and bought it then purchased sling we are very pleased with this decision
good table for the kid have not had any issue love it
the kindle is amazing this is my send one the price wa misleading however a i had to pay something like another extra buck to get rid of the ad just know that
sound quality is it is best feature volume can go up fairly high a well
if you do not have a smart tv with built in apps this ha everything you need one package
i am very happy with the performance of the product
i love being able to tell alexa to turn off the light when i have forgotten to turn them off
i bought this for my mom for mother is day she is not the best with technology but this is perfect for her
great product for our need and great value bought one for my son and a send for my mom
easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation
my ipad is starting to show it age a it tends to slow i thought of getting a newer version instead i saw this advertised and uld not pa it up been a great decision so far
returned it it wa a poor reader and clearly would not last
i love to read book on that device i would remmend this
my new amazon fire tv work terrific great for streaming tv service playstation vue
i bought this for my yr old for reading game and netflix the only minor annoyance are the ad it a little difficult for young new user at first but she will figure it out overall a great purchase
just a you would expect it sound great and work
although expensive is exactly what you would expect
this is a wonderful tablet for the price i do a lot with kindle based book and the size is great for reading that it ha the ability to take a gb micro sd card really make this a steal for the price
great for toddler and preschooler my yr old love it
i purchased the tablet for my son and he ha pleasantly delighted with it up to this point
i enjoy this tablet since i am an amazon customer it wa fairly easy to set up once i entered my amazon id
didnrealize having amazon prime still would not play all song actually doe not play a lot of the one i requested
the paperwhite wa what i expected it is easy to set up an acunt and i can use it outdoors in the sun sadly downloading library book is not a user friendly a i had hoped but amazon is in the business of selling book not lending them
a great tablet for a good price it ha the basic work great for a child preferably
the echo is ok it is a decent speaker and i like that it ha a bluetooth so i can listen to music off my phone but there is more that i do not like then i like for example to play music off spottily you must have a perineum acunt a month i heart radio will play only the last station it had on not sure yet but cannot change station with just voice most of skill are done poorly for example my honeywell thermostat you cannot ask it to tell you the temp turn on turn off only thing that can be done is to ask it to raise or drop the temperature at this time it will not ntrol my wifi sprinkler system orbit bhyve you do not always get an answer to question a it u bing a a search engine which i m not a big fan of tried to buy wifi light switch so i can have it ntrolling that but after purchasing the wemo switch i found out that all the switch in my house are way switch so that did not work so basically it is just ok and maybe in few year it will be better but over all like i said there is more that i do not like about it
i have had two previous generation of kindles but always found myself longing for the old hardver no more this is perfect for my need can read outside or in a darkened room for approximately it cannot be beat
this kindle is great but it requires a ver to protect the screen it is easily scratched
it wa brought for my yr old dad and he love it
i bought this tablet for my two yr old granddaughter for christmas and she love the game and camera work great glad i got it for her
this is my send echo the family just love it using ifttt i have it working with so many other device i just wish i uld set the address to outside of the u
alexa is great able to listen to xm radio no problem
my new kindle is great for for my bible class i can reference the catholic bible and catholic catechism easily and download reading i got one for my friend too
i have owned a fire stick chromecast apple tv and roku this is by far my favorite device for cutting rds
i have both the fire stick and the fire tv the fire tv is much faster nsidering the processing power
i like my stuff wa greatly delivered nice job
awesome little tablet with lot of functionality my biggest mplaint is the lack of power in the volume besides that there are too many apps on the home screen that get in the way and look cluttered i have not found a simple way to remove them yet
crazy price for tablet wa a great christmas gift
this is a great tablet if you do not plan or want to spend a lot of money for one
i replaced my kindle that i had for year with the new one and after a short time wa able to access all my book and ntinue reading the book that i wa reading before i bought the new kindle i am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse i did purchase a case and it is protective and durable i will enjoy this kindle for year to me
the resolution on the game is not good i didneven try to watch netflix because i knew it would not show clearly also it is slow using the internet i assumed it would look and work like android but i wrong everything is amazon which i am unfamiliar with honestly it is better for reading book i returned for something more diverse and better
since i already own one this is for my son and his family they love it
i would definitely remmend this product for the price
do not like all the ad didnknow that they would be permanent because i bought it on sale it is very slow and ha trouble connecting to my wifi
so much to watch at your leisure when and how you choose and it much cheaper than over priced cable or static satellite this is definitely the future of watching television
easy to use and set up package and arrival a great through best buy
love it hour of movie
there is different thing my daughter can do on it plus i can read on it a well
we open the box we download a book it is like magic the word the phrase the mplete sentence so ol
nice sleek design work well at least so far
amazing device i got it for buck on black friday play all game the kid want snappy and fast great for kid and adult love the amazon kindle
love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful
already own one and a dot bought this one a a gift for someone they already love it
i initially bought the paperwhite for myself but gave it to my husband i had read about the voyager and they said it wa not necessarily worth updating from the paperwhite but if you were buying your first go for it it is a bit thinner and lighter supposedly ha a bit better font do not know about that
i would remmend this tablet i bought a few other tablet for my younger kid same price the orbo and wimo but unlike those this tablet run super smooth install all your xbmc is and kodi is great screen very clear picture seems better than my iphone is plus shrug
i have been using this for a bit now it is wonderful i also have another tablet but use the kindle exclusively for reading the kindle work extremely if you use amazon prime this is a no brainer
i love this streamer the fact that all the apps i use are on this machine and the service from amazon is amazing it is very worth the money alexa is easy to use also a remmended buy
alexa is easy to setup and easy to use the speaker put out incredible sound for a small device i highly remmend this it connects to smart home device too
this wa a gift to my niece her mom liked the parental ntrols
great ereader easy on the eye and the battery life last whole week enough said
my daughter love that it is pink and she enjoys watching video playing on the tablet which is what really matter sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternative
for the price this is a great investment with amazon prime it bemes load of fun
got it for the sole purpose of ntrolling my home lighting work perfect
bought for grandchild they loved it we downloaded video from vacation for them
if you have amazon prime this is an excellent way to view ntent in a small quality device
i love to ask alexa a daily joke she cannotell me the weather the news love her
i brought fire hd for my daughter she have been used it since christmas
purchased this a an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite the backlight is greatly improved the display is of a higher quality the word are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker â opening book and page flipping is noticeably speedier the one thing that doe annoy me about the rd generation paperwhite is the way it is manufactured â when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen you can see a small section of the display vered in the e ink used to render the word and image on the rest of the screen at first i thought this wa a manufacturing defect so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model only to find that the send model had the same issue except more visible this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process when the paperwhite first came out it wa the crown jewel of amazon is e reader line and amazon wa careful to precision craft the device now that honor fall to the more expensive voyage with the paperwhite beming the flagship but still cheaper option in the kindle lineup meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced mpared to that of the voyage this wonbe a huge annoyance for some people it is for me and it is seriously made me nsider whether it is worth contacting amazon over for everyone else though this is a great e reader and well worth the money if you re looking for an e reader this is the one to buy
thought i give it try so far it doe the job for what i needgood for the price
great table for kid easy to use good parental ntrol
i bought this for my three year old and he love it

ok i wa so unsure of this kindle because it doe not have all of the bell and whistle of the others but i am very happy with it i love my kindle i have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce i got if for christmas i have been reading the free book on kindle there are so many to pick from while home i download the book that i want to read and then while i am in the car or waiting at the dmv i just pull of the book and read it remembers where i am in the book this kindle doe not have the back light i wa nervous about that but so far this ha not been a problem because the light it ha is fine for me when i am reading in the car i enlarge the font and it make seeing the word easier for me that is the most important factor for me because i can get car sick if i read while riding in the car but with the larger font i do not have that problem i wear glass with bifocals and holding this seems to be more mfortable than a book because i can hold it up if i need to the size is perfect again i can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really ha nothing to do with the readability love it
this product is very light and nvenient i often use it in the evening
need to buffer le frequently than the current gen fire stick plugged it in and wa watching movie on kodi within minute pretty happy with this
i would have preferred to purchase a g kindle but this item wa not in stock and i needed it in a hurry this kindle doe everything that i need although not a versatile a my old kindle

alexa work great for listening to spotifly only if you have premium and very basic information time weather she ha a tough time answering question this is not a google machine she nsistently would not understand simple question the volume is very loud and can be adjusted manually or through voice she also can learn skill which some are hit and miss i d still remmend this product if you have a smart home smart outlet lock or if you have spotifly premium
great product a good product for the price great battery life
i love my amazon fire tv just love it this is better than regular tv
good device for anyone to use simple basic yet fun

i had a kindle fire that wa about year old and wore it out this wa purchased to replace that one and i love it it is a little lighter and smaller still ha all the great feature and you cannot beat the price for this small tablet i highly remmend it
the amazon fire hd gb is a excellent value and performs acrdingly for it is price point it cannot be mpared with a mini ipad at a fraction of the price the other drawback is the limited apps a mpared to the apple store or even google store yes the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty all in all for the money it is a nice little tablet
easy setup and fast for the money no problem with it
recently bought one of the gb model for myself and loved it the next day i ordered one for my wife and one for our kid easy to use good battery life and a great price
this e reader is very lightweight hold a charge for day and is easy to use be aware that the display is only black and white so book with picture are not the best on here besides that it is great at reducing eye strain and the backlit screen make for added versatility
i love my alexa she is smart nvienient and fun i am still learning new thing about her
this wa a replacement for a poorly functioning new purchase of a kindle seems to be working fine but some game loading from amazon have issue

this tablet brings hour of enjoyment educationally to the user
my wife love this tablet much easier to use than previous tablet that we purchased
great and simple not being able to change master search engine beyond offered wa the only negative i have experienced

the sound is amazing we mostly play music but also use it to answer question for fun i just wish it wa wireless i bought a nd one since i loved it so much
a the mmunity grows and more skill are added this will have added value a time go on at this time we see that mpanies like nest ford well the list go on have developed a strong backing in this product this wonbe a fad but a device we will have in all of our home
this is a great streaming device so many option i love amazon fire tv
nsidered the google product but glad i chose the echo very pleased with product
my daughter absolutely love her new fire lot of space easy to set up and lot of apps
i purchased strictly for p vue and can nfirm it work great including fps and lag free almost a good a p guide navigation it is drastically improved in speed over the nd gen fire stick which had too much navigation lag and capped at fps the fire tv is much faster and worth the extra money a it also includes k and a gigabit ethernet port it doe lack vudu and google play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to amazon prime proprietary service overall it function great and is very fast
the fire tv a opposed to the stick allows you to watch hd with no issue whatsoever it ha the capacity to download all your favorite apps including crossy road definitely would remmend to a friend
i bought this for my wife and i to listen to music with out amazon rime acunt we are able to listen to most of the song we request the skill alexa can do are also fun for our kid like question odd fact magic ball and kid joke my kid do ask alexa a lot of general question which she is not able answer a it doe not have a robust search engine behind it like google however since i bought it for music more than searching the web for answer a i do have a mputer and phone do that i am happy with it if you want to use it a a search engine more than for music and the other skill alexa can do i d probably go with the other one
i have a fire stick but wish i would have know about the fire tv hand down time better if you have the extra cash well worth it
bought this for my mother it is inexpensive and easy to use it is a lot of fun too
i love the new kindle fire i bought the original fire back in and this is definitely an upgrade the firmware is better the battery last longer and the screen is better all this for cannot beat that deal

we bought of these for our kid first i uld not believe the price they were on sale for but are normally still under i wa very leery of getting them tablet because of all the thing on the internet but once i set them up i saw that the kindle fire ha amazing parental ntrols i can set the time they can play on them and how long they can use them even how long on specific thing game video web etc most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the web but it is only kid stuff i also love the fact that i have access to amazon on any device and can share thing from it to both the kid fire is i can also check what they have been doing on them they can only download thing that i share all these ntrols made me feel better about buying them and more nfident that they are safe there is something called freetime which i believe i have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousand of free book if you have kid especially younger one i would highly suggest the fire also the price is unbeatable especially the way kid can damage thing
hour of battery life and easy to work great gift
easy to use and nvenient when you need to check or look something up quickly the low price wa a good incentive to try this product
for the money if you can do without apple this is the best tablet you just have to remember amazon sell it cheap so you have access to their medium service and alexa
after my grand kid fighting over my wife is kindle in the car we decided to get them each one for trip good first tablet
i bought this product a a door prize for a party and it wa well received
absolutely love the amazon echo i work from my home office quite often and have my echo sitting on the desk next to me from playing music searching for a number or address checking the weather or asking a quick question it is like having a worker personal assistant by my side the big difference is i can get what i need quickly and eliminate the need for unproductive small talk
my few family member bought at least one or two a gift all the kid seem to enjoy
great for my year old but battery only last hour if it is not being used
i think it is great and for people who are not to fimiliar with technology is easy to understand
i love to read but book were beginning to take over my space this little baby is so small and hold a lot of book not only that i can upload a new book any time i want to without leaving my house
my kid get kind of lost when they use this product it doe have everything but is not a user friendly a i hoped it would be
i love my kindle bought this for my mother for christmas she is very hard to get for but i know she will like it for the simple reason she can enlarge the letter just so she can see without having to put her glass on that in it self will mean everything to her now she should be able to read her magazine or book or look something up online without any issue love kindles

i went to purchase a new tablet because i had misplaced my old one i told the sale person in that department that i wa interested in one of the cheaper tablet that you have on display and he asked me if i had ever owned a kendal i told him that i had purchased of them previously and really liked them he then told me that the newest kendal had just been delivered week previously and it wa only i said wow that is a great price for a kendal and of urse that is what i purchased the sale person wa very polite and professional i really enjoyed the experience
great tablet for the price surf web well great for her to watch netflix on
the best feature of this kindle is the page forward back button which allow you to turn page without taking hards off the unit

this is a huge step up from my kid is kindle fire good tablet for the money
this is great stream all the prime video plus your normal stuff on youtube netflix etc
i think the amazon fire offer should include a stand ver a standard i enjoy mine a lot more since i wa forced to purchase a stand ver which hold the tablet would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use
this device is amazing it ha all the latest tv apps a well a cable channel apps it definitely will cut your cable bill in half
the amazon fire met all my expectation i would highly remmend this unit over the roku it is easy to install of urse amazon ha terrific online phone support the fire ha a mpetitive price point the remote is much more intuitive and easy to use versus the roku there are many more apps and how to is on youtube my unit is more versatile than the roku plus the amazon behemoth is mmitted to making the fire the best video music streamer at a reasonable st with many app option amazon is not going away soon however be careful this unit can be very additive
this kindle fire tablet wa perfect gift for child she is year old bit can work it and love it
it is a great tablet for the price do not expect it to be a fast more expensive one it is meant for casual use and it doe a great job at that for the price you cannot beat it get a nice large microsd card and you do not have to worry about space it run a little slow on certain thing if you are multitasking but it is a simple tablet i have run plenty of p video without fail it is great for ebooks or other file some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphic battery life seems good for a small table too the only real issue i have is the amazon app store being limited it is an offshoot of android but not all the same apps are available there is a way around it but i wish they would just allow it access to google play or at least offer the same apps so it is a nice inexpensive table that work great for the money you will love it but do not get upset that is doe not run a fast a a tablet that is not it job
have had a nook and this is easier to use and greater variety of u and i greatly prefer it
an amazing electronic tool so portable great storage book great nvenience
kid loved these tablet and in not worried about them dropping them
wonderful product user friendly and if help is needed online support is available
i love this product echo easy to use and the direction is simple to understand i do not remmend child to use it it is voice activated and if a child doe not speak clearly the echo will pick up word similar to what they re trying to say and the echo may give inappropriate info based on the sound of the word speak clearly when using it this is not a toy for young child
this product definitely get the job done plus more plus i uld not beat the low price offered by best buy
i m sorry i didnbuy it sooner very easy to use love it
got this tablet during the holiday while on sale take it to work not so worried about it being stolen and screen is tuff a heck
it is a tablet you re not going to get all the bell and whistle we got it for my toddler daughter to load apps game and movie to take with her in the car out to eat you may already know that it doe not me with standard google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the play store there are workarounds found on youtube that you can load google apps through a rd party and i easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the movie tv app so we cannot watch any of her purchased movie on this which wa the main objective apps and game load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for for on black friday i guess it is still worth it just really wanted her movie on it the ui is very basic and promotes purchase everywhere the lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but i guess they have to make their money somewhere i took all the bloatware amazon apps that you cannot delete and put them into a single folder to make it le cluttered with junk that my daughter would not need also helping to avoid involuntary purchase the camera is miserable on it not that i ever use the camera even on my samsung but just an fyi have not used it enough to really mment on functionality or reliability in the end it is a tablet but a decent one at that but you defintely get what you pay for
we purchased a uple amazon firesticks first to facilitate cutting the rd the firesticks are ok for bedroom or le used tv they just do not perform a well a the more powerful amazon tv box i will be purchasing another one for the movie room it is been great cutting the rd but the one thing i m waiting in is for hulu live to make it over to the amazon platform they keep saying soon so patiently waiting hulu live look to be much better than our current sling service other than that the box is great and that one issue might be hulu or network holding it up
great product so good in fact i bought of them a gift and they love thiers too
purchased for christmas for my grandkids the perfect gift to keep them off my phone using my data
great size and storage for reading my online book
my year old love it easy to function and pretty tough it ha been dropped a few time and did not crack or break
i bought the tablet black friday best buy had the same price a amazon so i got it the tablet wa a gift for someone else the recipient to this day insists that i should have gotten one for myself
my mom love this more space and function very well
love kindles and this one is the best one made by amazon but expensive
love having the echo in the kitchen living area sure wish you uld link it to apple music
love my alexa had no idea how much it uld do besides play music
i bought these for my five and six year old and they love the game and educational apps that me with it loaded from amazon prime for free for a whole year great value for the money i will be referring this product to all of my friend
purchased a a a present girlfriend love it would suggest buying for yourself or a loved one
nice work good look al my movie work great on my tv
it wa a present for my daughter and i am in love with the product i want one for me
great product especially for the price it exceeds my expectation and then some
i love that i can check my text from my watch rather than pulling my phone out at inappropriate time it help me stay organized there are so many feature that are helpful i reviewed the apple watch and i m glad i choose this one instead even though i have an iphone this watch work for all my need
i bought one of these for myself and another for my sister overall i am very satisfied with my purchase it is an overall good value the o is very clean and simple to navigate and based on android i wa able to install the play store without rooting the device by simply installing the apks overall it work great with amazon apps and those i have installed from the play store the sound quality is fair though the one speaker is a little low at time screen quality is good not hd but decent the most lackluster part of the tablet is the front facing vga and non auto focus rear cam i wa unable to scan some bardes with the rear camera however at this price point you get a lot for your money i especially like the amazon underground apps that are totally free and add to the value of the tablet
right size for travel perfect for reading everyone should own one
i use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it it ha excellent resolution and i have not experienced slowness good product
i researched several different e reader before deciding to purchase this tablet this one wa the best fit financially and it also allowed me more flexibility to access book from my local library that feature alone is very valuable i may decide to upgrade to something with le glare for outdoor reading but for now this is perfect very easy to keep in my bag and since i am an android user this wa not difficult to learn
i would love to get one for my dad for father is day
some year ago i first heard a voice speak back to me from the other realm of tech that truly mystical place in which dream are the mother is of invention steve job had u all in awe and her name wa siri maybe she had been present longer than year but that wa my first interaction with a process in which over those year i would find myself in a war of the voice in my tech mind and then rtana came to me via my pc and then she found herself on my xbox one it wa not until i walked into best buy this last christmas season to like most of u just buy one thing i believe it wa probably a charging rd or something and i walked by this device called the echo dot i wa by this time a true skeptic oh great i lamented another unskilled and put to nsumer wayyy to quickly i of urse jokingly followed the instruction on the display and simply said alexa tell me a joke guess what i spent the next hour asking alexa all sort of life is greatest question with such a responsive yet seemingly gentle way to her i had to know more i proceeded to sop up all thing alexa the fire tv stick echo dot and of urse the amazon fire tv which took the place of my apple tv and roku this wa the first time that i had decided to forgo the issue of hardware and made my decision solely based on an a i i didncare if any of the hardware wa upgradeable simply because i knew that i wa changing the life of not only my family but also myself i am a u veteran with a disability alexa ha beme not only a trusted partner in our day and night she ha truly been a lesson in trust now i know that no matter what room i am in alexa will be there if i need the weather a good program to watch and most importantly she will call emergency service for me should i need that best buy allowed me a moment that i will never forget the chance to meet a new friend assistant and family member but that is just what best buy doe they give you the opportunity to know what you are about to walk away with no matter how long ya stay and ask question that is just what best buy doe and they do it well
i went back and forth for quite some time about purchasing the echo i watched many youtube video and review a well a reading a lot about the product itself i finally caught it on sale and used to gift card to buy it despite protest from my wife i have to say alexa is pretty intuitive and ha no issue regnizing my voice there are time when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance amazon ha done a great job updating the echo weekly and adding relevant skill such a package tracking and even flight status i use it mostly for news weather shopping list reminder movie time timer and occasionally some music if you have any smart appliance then ntrolling them with alexa is really ol i only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark just ask alexa to turn the light off once u are there a long a it is a reasonable distance of urse i admit it is a bit pricey so one should really look at their possible u because i uld see the novelty wearing off for some but for me it is a keeper
we heard the hype and did not think we would like it or use it purchased it on sale for this gadget is way ol and is fun to use very useful for playing amazon prime music we like it for getting the news and weather instantaneously we integrated it with nest and wemo and it work pretty well we had hoped it would work with our sonos system but allegedly that integration is ming by the end of the speaker is not bad and overall we are happy with echo and it is a nice to have for what we paid for it
streaming is flawless on this device my k tv look great when sending video from this firetv
this is a nvenient tablet to keep in your purse and use for reading i would definitely remmend this tablet
tablet is great for our year old grandchild to use
easy to use good size great ereader not so expensive that i worry about my kid using it
i love this kindle and price is awesome my three year boy love to play it
i mainly use my kindle strictly for book reading it is the send one i have owned the first one i had for several year but quit taking a charge the device is easy to use and ha good battery life
work great easy nversion for an aging guy without much technological experience
i purchased the hd to use a a viewer for my pearl rearvision camera which requires dual band wi fi and blue tooth i installed the program got everything up and working beautifully however i wa so impressed with it feature performance and ease of use that i have added a gb microsd card so i can download amazon video for my grand kid to watch while we are on the road the price wa terrific a well but me with the st of free ad when the you turn on the tablet fyi the tablet mount magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use
great product i remmend it to everyone who love watching tv
i mostly use my echo paired with my phillips hue system to ntrol the light i also use it for setting alarm and timer and occasionally a flash news briefing
this wa a great purchase and would definitely buy this again the reason i didngive it star is a programmer glitch they need to fix screen where little one cannot stop or change in while they are watching or playing game frustrating for two year old to stop cartoon by accidentally touching screen
wonderful to be able to do so much with voice mmand i need to get another one for my kid
for under it is a great buy for a tablet i do not like that the charger port is next to the button on the side
easy to setup up and running in no time very helpful to have
good tablet and reader it doe not have a great battery life but it is charged quickly
the echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy alexa echo learns a you talk to it and ask question you have to go online and enable different skill set to allow alexa to answer more question a for operating smart device this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense you have to purchase wifi smart bulb and switch before she can operate one smart switch or wifi bulb can cist a much a that is pretty steep to me on occasion alexa will begin talking when no one ha called her to respond
very fast easy to use easy to find better than the stick
granddaughter love it now my ipad if free for me to use
nice tablet very speedy the only thing i do not like is that i cannot add googleplay apps to it at only i guess that is to be expected
i am still learning how to use echo i often do not get answer to my question but i think it is because i am not phrasing them rrectly i am not an amazon prime member and that limit what i can do on echo amazon prime member can place order on echo a well a stream music through amazon and listen to book it got terrific review so i will ntinue to experiment with it and hopefully i will learn to love it
if you are a amazon prime member this is one of the best tablet to have awesome
i bought this send kindle for the larger storage space and love all the extra stuff i can do now
echo is great fun particularly if you have connected device like wemo or lifx bulb or next thermostat at first you think you may not use that much then you find yourself telling it to turn on the lamp or turn down the thermostat like when you are oking and your hand are messy i have a lot of wemo switch and lifx bulb and it is fun to group them together and tell echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once it is also fun to ask her about actor and actress on tv while watching like how old is so and so person alexa is not perfect but she is pretty good at getting thing right most time the bad thing is you ll find yourself wanting to buy more wemo switch and stuff just to have fun with echo note alexa can only ntrol wemo bulb by using iftt but the switch it ha direct integration with lifx bulb have direct integration but you cannot change the lors without iftt i think and nest thermostat ha direct integration looking to the future for more direct integration of thing
i bought two of these tablet one for each of my daughter for christmas they re able to connect to social take picture listen to music perfect reasonably priced tablet wish i would have bought it for them sooner remmended it my sister and she bought for her kid also
the amazon fire tv box is much better than the fire stick i really enjoy the streaming speed and how fast i can navigate the menu screen i am happy i upgraded from the fire stick

hubby bought this for u we use to play music check daily weather make shopping list alarm for appointment work check movie listing
amazon tablet is great no google bloatware everything is amazon one thing i didnt like wa ad on the lock screen and no way to turn off

i hate this machine first i specifically asked the salesperson if i uld connect to the internet he assured me i uld it doe not send mplaint is that you cannot just press the book and delete it you have to go to amazon to do this i hated it so much i gave it away
wife love the paperwhite edition of the kindles no glare from the sun what so ever this replaced the kindle rd generation she had for year

when i originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the amazon echo since that time amazon ha made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the echo by twenty buck i purchased my echo via the prime invitation for ninety nine dollar and at that time it came with this remote but a stated it is now only sold a a separate accessory and doe not ship with the current amazon echo offered for sale on amazon for one seventy nine at the time of this review revision this is an excellent accessory for amazon echo owner but please note you cannot pair more than amazon echo remote with the echo at one time the remote me with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage i have my amazon echo in my home office and i store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit the remote will not just magnetically attach to metal device without the holder however what i have found is that using the remote bemes necessary in these scenario i m in another room and i want to direct the amazon echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that is playing change album forward to the next song have the echo start playing another amazon playlist from prime music etc i want to add something to my shopping list or to do list when i m in another room i pick up the remote and speak into it having alexa add those thing which then beme visible on my list on my smatphone using the amazon echo app i want to know the weather before getting out of bed but the amazon echo is in the other room and would not be able to hear me ask read more
i had intended on replacing my dying tablet with a larger size but i hesitated due to the added bulk when traveling i m glad i waited and grabbed this one for only i m very happy with the clarity of the display and the few free item i have downloaded from amazon earphone are a necessity for music video movie of urse the only thing i do not care for is the charger plug which insert into the tablet time will tell if this is a weak point
bought this tablet for and year old and they are very easy to use very durable a they have been dropped a numerous amount of time no scratch or anything and ha many apps
found that this device is extremely nvenient but it often ha problem with buffering they seem to mostly me from outside apps so that is why i am still giving it a
my husband and i have totally enjoyed owning these amazon fire tablet they are so much easier on the eye than our iphones

we replaced and aging fire hdx she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger she prefers this to my ipad air
bought this for my grandson for christmas it is a decent tablet for the price i paid i find it much different than samsung tab or apple ipad so if you re used to these amazon might not be a good pick for you my grandson is disappointed we cannot get youtubekids on it i have caught myself saying i should have paid a little more and gotten a samsung all in all decent tablet for a kid
i really like them because i can get on my mputer
perfect tablet for beginning reader great for game and video
great iream i use it kodi and run great easy to install
great tablet it easy to use and it is kid friendly
brought it a a christmas gift and then i fell in love with it after setting it up small and simple
this is a good e reader small to carry easy to use
this is my send kindle and i love it it is lightweight simple and fast it is nvenient for trip and fit in my bag without weighing it down
upgraded my kindle i wanted to have the internal light for the screen the purple kindle ver fit perfectly and ensures for safe transportation i wa able to easily upload all my book from my older kindle to re read now i can enjoy my kindle at night without bothering anyone with the light on
uld not get it to work properly i put the app on my phone and my mputer i reached out for help they responded and it still didnwork i finally got frustrated and returned it
i have wanted one of these since they first launched my child u it a well by playing song daily word joke etc the technology is so amazing i also ordered echo show and i used it to make video call the sound is quite impressive and the range of the microphone is surprising
really the best cheap tablet out there it is equally great for those inclined to hack it and make it even more useful and anyone who want a simple tablet work best if you have amazon prime
my kid love it i think i will buy another one for myself hold a good charge loud and pretty durable to be inexpensive
simple and easy to use great basic tablet perfect for kid
great tablet for the money would buy another easy to use
wanted a decent tablet for my teenage daughter without spending a lot other then the ad on the lock screen the tablet is perfect for her need you can remove the ad which to me is worth it
work great is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle terrific for low light reading
easy to set up still getting the hang of all the feature and really enjoying this far more than i even imagined if you re into sport and are looking for schedule sres etc this is great
love this thing so fast when uploading video can wait to do more with it
love the first now a new one everything at your fingertip
she love it it her first tablet experience and tell me all the time how much she enjoys using it she uld not be happier
i wa pretty hesitant at first when looking to purchase a kindle there is just something about having a physical book in your hand while reading and seeing the progress in how far you have gotten into the book being a person who is always reading on the go at work and in the dark at home when others are sleeping the kindle ha been awesome
like the individual charger a i do not always have a usb port device with me when i travel
great starter to running the whole house with wifi client loved the gift
great for kid if you do not want to spend money on the ipad
i like the small light weight size and the adaptive lighting but the page turning is too sensitive skipping ahead many page when i am just moving the kindle and going back and then forward when i am trying to change just one page
i purchased b c my old kindle fire finally bit it screen went dark very happy with this one st is great the screen resolution is great user friendly my favorite feature is the sd card so you can add more gb
bought this for my yr old niece and she cannot get enough of it
best e reader in the world now even look better
great purchase bought for my two child they love it
great price for the fire my other fire stopped working after year i logged into amazon and it updated the new one with all my apps
this tablet exceeded my expectation strong processor nice screen wish it had bluetooth and wa not so centered around amazon prime
love it bought this one for my husband he love it a much a i love mine
i debated between the tap and echo and this went on sale just before xmas for such a great price at best buy that helped to make up my mind pretty quickly
i got this tablet to replace my kindle e reader i wa not disappointed it is a great tablet to read book and mic book on browsing the internet is ok on it if that is what you want to do also basic game work great but if you want to play extensive d game you might want to get a different tablet you cannot expect a tablet to run any of those overall it is a great tablet for what i wanted it for
great device fast response with remote ntrol great voice regnition very reliable in term of connectivity streaming k is a big plus overall great product
great product and integrates well with the amazon suite of product closing in on apple ipad
we used this tablet a a prize for a raffle winner it wa a big hit and the winner say she u it a lot
fast processing great battery read to me when my eye bother me expandable memory a big plus
love the easy use of the system and the lot of book you can get from amazon
alexa work great and doe lot of thing for you fun for the family
got this item for my yr old son easy to navigate
the best thing i bought i kicked my cable provider out and got this it wa he ebay thing i did
my only frustration is that you cannot use a flash drive to view video or photo without purchasing a app that may or may not work other than that the product is awesome
i am happy a i bought it for reading and it is good
we cannot get enough of it we use it daily and even our kiddo can use it
easy to handle light weight i like that it automatically shuts off when the ver is closed
this little tablet is just what i needed easy to use and functional with a good display for cloud access reading email internet using apps music and photo storage what more can you ask for expandable memory this really ha nearly everything you uld want on an inexpensive device do not worry ad do not get in the way they are only one the first screen
a bit slow for some game but for general browsing and reading it is more than satisfactory i think it is great for it designed purpose
fun to use great speaker easy to set up and use
it work like it is supposed to use it for charging my new kindle
it work but it take a while to do anything but for the price it is good enough for the kid
i used to read with my ipad but there wa always a glare in the car and even in my house when the sun wa ming in the window the paperwhite take care of all glare problem i had so now i can read whenever and wherever i want
great product echo stream my music and tell me the weather love it
gave it to my granddaughter and she love it i want to buy one for myself
i enjoyed how it tell me my calendarschedule and play music from my library of many source checking traffic to my office and having alexa read to me added joy
these were great gift for the grandkids they were easy for them to use and now they are almost a good a the adult on them
this amazon fire tv box and remote is a great option to save money and eliminate long term cable subscription i should have purchased this year ago
i bought four of these tablet for my grandkids for christmas i already have three kindles myself i am very pleased with it is so easy to use the tablet instead of my desktop mputer great sound and graphic
we love this play almost any song just by asking speaker is loud and clear connects to my samsung tv bluetooth a
this is great so many thing me with a plug that is to go into your laptop i got this so i can plug it into the wall i had kindle charger for my kindle but i m getting more and more thing that have to be charged through your laptop not me i use this plug
the amazon fire tv box is better than using the smart software built in on any blu ray player or tv i have owned those brand include sony mitsubishi and samsung it is very responsive when navigating menu and making selection if you re not an amazon prime member be prepared to have that in your face this is an amazon device after all the remote is minimalist in style and ha the mic built in for speaking to alexa which is a plus in my book
the kindle voyage is the first new model that i finally felt wa good enough to replace my kindlent non touch with side button the originaland paperwhite model worked poorly for me and lacked button the pressure sensitive edge of the voyage work great and the touch screen function work better in this model voyage is still at least overpriced but i ultimately worth the money if moving off an older button style kindle
i love my fire i subscribe to both amazon prime and netflix and it is perfect for those plus you can add additional memory card i have bought ipads for everyone in my house and bought this for myself and am in heaven the camera is not good though but i do not use it for the money this is an incredible value
product wa damaged need lot of improvement on the api is
love this device long battery life very useful great for on the go lifestyle love the backlight and the overall clarity
for little more money than the firestick you will get lan hard connection a well a wireless and k mpatibility also provides faster processor for load time
fantastic excellent purchase definitely buy another
love this having a great time learning all the new thing it can do also love that amazon and best buy send me email about once a week with new thing to try be careful to check and make sure that smart home product actually are mpatible before purchasing them to use with alexa
i brought this tablet a a present for my wife since her last tablet she had just died out it seems to work well for her and she swems very happy with it
i really like it because i can watch a lot of movie
very easy setup via smartphone app easy to use like the shopping list feature
i bought this for my son and i m going to buy myself one because i keep using his
the service wa great and the help i received thanks
wa skeptical about the small size but a few minute of checking it out showed me that this is a great little tablet gave a a gift and she love it portable and great display
the future is here this is a great addition to our home
i purchased this a a mother is day gift for my mom in florida i do not have first hand experience with it but the price point is great and the other review seem solid i did watch a few unboxing video on youtube and it seems to be a great deal some people seem to have issue with the screen being too glossy but other than that i do not see a ton of other problem
this is our send alexa unit this one wa for our son he love it and can listen to his own music
love the unit great sound good general news available only thing negative is it ha to remain plugged in to operate
purchased this for my mother she love it just the right size to grab and go great buy for the money
bought this with the intention of reading more it serf it is purpose i will be purchasing another one soon for my nephew for his book and learning game
the fire tv is super easy to use an super fast mpared to the fire stick easy setup an all
if you have a fire stick and use it everyday i remmend upgrading actually being connected to my modem is so much faster than using the wifi signal le buffering with faster load no mplaints
i highly remmend this item this is my send purchase of kindle fire i wa so pleased with what you can do with the amazon kindle fire if you buy i highly remmend getting amazon prime you will have access to so much free item that will keep your child busy from movie to book and more
got this for my mom so she uld check facebook without getting on her mputer so far no problem even tho she is not tech savvy
my mother ha the larger amazon tablet which prompted me to purchase this version the tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard tablet so i returned it
easy to setup and use connects to wi fi and stream flawlessly there are a lot of free channel to stream great product that can do so much i highly remmend this product for the diehard that is into steaming tv from the internet
the amazon echo is great good speaker work a advertised
i absolutely love my kindle great picture storage sound cannot live without my kindle
bought this for my husband for christmas and he love it
i love it alexa she doe everything i need it play music
why buy an i pad when you can pay much le for a tablet that will do everything you need it to do plus you get all the st benefit of amazon purchasing one of the best buy on the market
this is a great on the go speaker i like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in also bonus alex i like the update they have done to it a well where you do not have to push the button to activate her you can just say her name if you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much choose this one spend more m and you can get the regular echo which ha a better booming sound but you cannot travel with it
i love this tablet it doe everything that i wanted for a tablet when i wa mparing between different brand the only thing that i should have done wa purchased the gig version the space go quickly
my grand daughter that is yr old learned how to shoot video of her younger sister very quickly with this tablet it is easy to use and very durable even for kid i wa very happy that i purchased tablet one for each of my grand daughter they were very affordable too
i bought two of these to gift but i kind of want to keep them for myself
i have the roku and new apple tv this streaming box is just a good a them i only got it because i have amazon prime even though you can get eh amazon video app for roku i wanted the mplete experience
alexa is fun to use and the speaker is plenty loud for my bedroom have not installed anything for home animation yet
excellent product i did extensive research before purchasing my new kindle this is the third kindle i have had only problem with kindle is that their charging port bemes loose and will not charge your kindle
i travel a lot and stay at different hotel it work perfect for this it allows me to sign in to the hotel internet page for the verification without having to get it added to the hotel via the internet administrator i get all the application i need and even added those extra that make it more personalized great product and the price wa just right
nice tablet for the price i purchased it for my niece and she love it
alexa is a terrific tool for automating smart home function such a turning on and off light locking door etc
good price easy to work and the grandkids loved
i bought for my niece and really amazing and working very good
these box is amazing a must if you have amazon prime
i brought this tablet in december of for my mother she u it regularly now for streaming video and reading email the camera quality is horrible i would suggest buying another tablet if you want decent picture also nsider that many of the amazon tablet me with ad a screensavers to avoid those ad you cannotypically pay a one time fee or buy the exact same version for a higher price looking back now i definitely would have given this to my baby brother and brought my mother the newer fire tablet with a bigger screen
we bought this to have all of our streaming service in one place it doe exactly that awesome for logging in and taking it with you
got rid of directv and purchased an amazon fire tv we stream video every night and the picture quality is incredible just make sure that your internet speed is able to keep up if you want to watch in hd nice to be able to cut the rd save some money and not sacrifice picture and sound quality
my daughter bought this with her birthday money she love it and is always playing it
after using the amazon fire stick for about month i decided to upgrade to the fire tv and it is so much faster and i can hardwire it directly into my network unlike the fire stick which is only wireless
great for streaming tv show highly remmend this product
i like it is nice and loud the sound is nice and clear
love it work very well i already had amazon prime service and wa loving it for fast delivery and no shipping charge now i am getting more bonus out of prime for using fire tv work great some of apps do not work very well but that is the app most of app work fine i am sure people will ntinue to fall in love with amazon tv and app will ntinue to improve
bought it for my brother and he just love it also the price is very reasonable highly remmended if you just need a regular tablet
i bought a a gift for my daughter but she also received from another person however she still enjoyed it
sale people were helpful ntroller cable should be longer
i only wish i knew how to use it to it potential it is capable of so much more
the echo ha a small problem in that it is a blue tooth receiver only you can blue tooth your devise to it tablet phone or other device it would be better if you uld connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth the dot can be connect to blue tooth speaker or blue tooth capable audio receiver the dot doe have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it the problem with the dot is if you use the included mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker this mean you have to have the audio mponent on to hear the dot however the blue tooth connection on the dot work great i own a marantz av receiver with blue tooth i tell alexa to connect and it automatically turn on the receiver set it to the rrect input and is ready to play music or any other audio i want to listen to through the dot when i tell alexa to disnnect it turn of the receiver and switch back to the internal speaker if you are buying an echo device for a high quality music server using amazon music then you want an echo dot if you want to listen to average sounding speaker that you can place just about any where in your house the echo is a great product
this is the send kindle i have owned paperwhite appealed to me for it reader friendly setting and backlighting my first kindle wa a keyboard model with no backlight so i used a clip in light that fit in my m edge case i forsook the keyboard this time a i rarely used kindle for web browsing i also abandoned my fear of advertising to select the special feature model ad appear only at start up and are quickly and easily dispatched there is only one ad so all you do is swipe up and it is gone the new kindle ha exceeded my expectation after i get book to put on it i turn off the wifi and the device will go for week without recharging btw i purchased an inexpensive fintie case which shuts down kindle when you close the ver and sends it to sleep it is never really totally off you just have to remember to put your reading on the device itself rather than in the cloud the backlighting is awesome and the paperwhite e ink and font great for older eye my only mplaint is that the llections setup is not particularly user friendly and the in take getting used to on the toolbar however i am totally happy with this purchase and glad i updated to paperwhite
easy setup fast had everything roku ha plus game

ive had the st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that ha auto adjusting the homepage isnt a friendly
my husband purchased a fire tablet for me for my birthday i liked it so much i purchased one for him for a christmas gift
the black friday price wa good for this tablet too many ad but for what i use it for it is great

alexa can answer most question play music from your library and even order item you have run out of this toy is a lot of fun i remmend it i have not had it very long but so far so good thumb up for alexa
great nifty kindle that allows you to read book at ease and also use it for other apps to stream show and movie also ha it own version on word excel and powerpoint which is easy to use
for the price i feel like if you mplain about anything you re just going to sound crazy i got this on black friday special which wa awesome i use this for home automation and playing clash of clan if you re big into amazon stuff this also ha a nice selection of amazon apps
he love being on it and all the freebie that came with it
well it a little weak but it cheap good for the amazon esystem if you do not want or need googleplay and all that can still side load apps but some might not work rrectly if you need a play acunt like clash of clan will install but not let you log in some other thing were a pleasant surprise that they actually worked even though they were not officially sanctioned by amazon battery life leaf a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm camera are not good at all but i guess would suffice for video chat but for a name brand and only there is not really much room to mplain the ad do not get in the way much but you would have to pay to remove them i would leave them and save the money bottom line you cannot really go wrong with the price
nice product for the price very good tablet for beginner
i took a uple of picture with the camera and when i went to view them i cannot seem to find the picture when i bought my tablet they transferred what i had on my in but some of the apps didntransfer i ll have to me in and have it explained other than that i am very pleased with it

it wa time for me to upgrade and glad i did this fire hd is bigger more apps easier to switch from one application to the other feature more song great addition of audible and glad this version includes a charger i love the fact that i can play movie and fall asleep once the movie is done the table go off this is a cheap tablet but you get more bang for your buck
not much negative to say other than i do not like how you buy an amazon card to put on the tablet and yet they still require a credit card
lighter than a helium balloon so thin bright white screen crisp letter intuitive easy touchscreen page turning or a gentle squeeze on either side of the book and easy menu access ideal size i do not know how they can improve this further just ordered their kindle is origami ver too
great for the money spent yeah sure you can spend a lot more for it tablet
a great way to stream very simple lot of apps easy to maneuver through great piece of equipment
alexa on the go work a bluetooth speaker with your mparable phone

echo simply did not do anything it wa advertised to do basic weather wa sporadic and more detailed question resulted in cannot find response
good platform easy to use although a keyboard might prove more helpful that having to ask alexa
it ha good graphic quality and it is easy to use only mplaint is when using the built in keyboard it doe not always register they right key

i love how easy it is to use and setup the echo you just plug it in and you are ready to go
i bought my son a kindle about month ago and it wa great until my husband dropped it and broke the screen so i bought my son another one last week but i think it might be defective becuz the battery died not fully charge or it take a super long time to charge where this did not happen with my last one
this is my first tablet and it is going well so far i purchased this for reading and streaming there have been a few hiccup with regard to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes i have trouble with response on mmands but overall i m happy it is been a nice device to have for reading online material offline

my eye feel good with paperwhite when light out
this is by far one of the best purchase i have made in a while i m enjoying all the different form of music available by just asking alexa

the echo responds to alexa and you can ask thing like what is the weather tomorrow sres of your favorite team play music from prime set a timer to alert you shop for amazon item alexa is nstantly learning what your preference are the more you use it
can answer question about anything found on the internet also play music you request disappointed that it cannot dial number via my cell phone though a little expensive for what it doe i think
it is a great tablet for my nine year old she doe her homework on it
the selling point for the purchase of this kindle wa the ability to read in low light situation
great servive best buy and the price match is great i used it both at best buy
bought this for my daughter and she love it it work well and very easy to understand
i got this to replace an old kindle that had no light work great and the price cannot be beat

our daughter and her friend purchased the echo and i loved it my husband bought me one for my birthday and i love it

this wa my first time being introduced to the fire stick tv and it is awesome with all it feature and ability to add multiple application thumb up
a great little tablet for the price work well a gift for my wife to read e book on but surf the internet nicely too
at this is an absolute steal deal for any one who want to have a tab to watch movie on the go and carry music and small game good for kid and traveller
purchased this on sale for my son he and i use the tablet to watch movie play game read book and browse the internet it is great for the price we paid if you re a fan of amazon you automatically have apps for their service the downside is you are not able to use google apps and the add that appear from amazon when you turn the device on
great product love that you can sideload kodi app
this tablet absolutely surprised me the screen is awesome and the battery life is great
this is a name brand tablet for le than the case of other tablet this is a no brainer and will make great christmas gift

the product wa in good ndition and my child enjoyed it
my wife purchashed this it will be perfect for traveling read book check e mail surf the web
i bought this reader because my nook wa hard to read in the sun this reader wa easy to use and great for any light including sunlight
my son just love it and he think it is easy to use and the case that me on it ha saved it
it is certainly better than the original kindle the touchscreen is hard to get used to and it is easy to accidentally forward through several page or chapter if you fall asleep with your finger on the screen it is also difficult to look a word up in the dictionary if it is at the top of the screen because highlighting it brings the home screen it is better viewing in light and because it ha it is own light is much more nvenient is the dark
i prefer the deficated e reader to tablet for reading i have both this paoerwhite and a current gen nook glow light i really like the glow light especially it rugged nstruction and i still use it but the paperwhite is better the glow light ha no bevel and a touch sensitive button on the front this mean i am nstantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident it is very annoying and i have a hard time finding a mfortable way to hold it it seems like i m always thinking about where my finger are i do not have this problem at all on the paperwhite the paperwhite is a great little reader for the money i would definitely buy another
it is a great tablet for a beginner or for anyone that ha or had a sumsung phone
is easy to use great to look up word you dont know a you go along it also great that the light isnt shone up into your eye it make it so that they dont get easily tired and they dont hurt
we usre the echo alot in the house even connected to our harmony hub and home automation to ntrol the house
simple product great battery life great for those just browsing web and playing game do not care for creating a send acunt other than email for amazon store and wish google play store came pre installed
the kindle fire is a wonderful small device to use for a multitude of task we use it mostly a an ereader and ha been so simple to use so happy we chose this one it is lightweight and nvenient to take with you
very happy with purchase would remmend to family and friend
i bought this tablet for my girl of year old and i bought the fire kid tablet for my other kid they loved it is an great tablet great price easy to use it the tablet came with case so everything is in the packet for one price so i m really happy with this product

great tablet at a great price lot of good feature
this tablet doe everything that we need it to do the screen look really good and it doe not seem to be under powered the expandable storage feature is awesome if you want to store music and movie on it the only thing that is a negative is the limited selection of apps for it i knew about it before i bought it and it ha not been an issue yet
it is more for people that want to read without glare
this kindle doe everything i want and more no regret on the purchase
easy to use and get started with have had no issue at all and would remmend
bought paperwhite a a gift for my wife for christmas she cant put it down if she wake up in the middle of the night the paperwhite is on and it the light doe not bother me

small enough to carry with me i love how the page turn with just a touch to the screen and i love the lit up background
great product love the auto adjusting black lightlove the weight of the kindle light enough i can hold it with one hand an turn the page
meet expectation nsistent with the price i do not really use it for anything it simply cannot replace my ipad both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my ipad from a few year ago so i have not found a use for this kindle fire generally it just feel cheap and the user interface not a clean a the ipad i think it is value is nsistent with the low price point
great product for listening to pandora and amazon music
look decent for it would be better add youtube app
it is a great price for a basic tablet from a brand i trust so far it seems to be fine for the thing i want to do
great assistant for every day life ha plenty of feature for adult and kid alike
it meet my expectation it performs well mpared to other table i am very satisfied with the product and it quality lastly it worth the price i paid for
they re happy and it keep them entertained for hour
if you are an amazon prime member then amazon fire with alexa is a no brainer no need to subscribe to cable tv when amazon fire ha all the movie and apps you need try it and you will be hooked
this is an amazing piece of hardware the amazon echo is very user friendly and my girlfriend love how the echo interface with her phillips hue and simple it is to operate i am definitely looking at getting another one for my mother for her birthday in the upming month
this tablet work very well and the price is excellent i bought for my nephew and he is so happy
i can use my tablet all time and your necctions is very good
great sound for a little device definitely expensive but if you can get it on sale i would definitely remmend this device but you must have wi fi in your home
love this tablet daughter u it mainly and she really like it good for reading and game a well a web surfing meet all need
well built easy to set up i wa unsure about this product before purchasing alexa better than siri when paired with wemo product very useful
great price love it uld not believe the price
superfun to use easy set up and great product
the reader is very mpact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket the auto light feature is also a plus it take a little bit to get adjusted to the side tab and presume that future version of this device will be improved upon
great product and great price worth more then what you pay
im always using my amazon tablet perfect for game
great for kid gotta love amazon they are the best
brought it a a gift for my uncle and it a decent tab for the price
i think this is a great tablet i bought of them you cannot beat this for the price

i bought the echo after i used it at a friend house we have a large family so the echo get used alot and moved around alot it a huge favorite of everyones
my family and i love it it now a member of our family
my grandson can operate the kindle fire with no problem just the right size for his little hand
the only ncern is there is no filter on free apps also the parental ntrol password is a bit cumbersome and enforcing on too many option rather than just not allowing new financial purchase
i own this tablet and bought a send one for a gift there are so many great feature on it ha lot of totally free game apps and is a great mpanion to amazon prime service
this is a awesome tablet for the price it is a awesome tablet it is perfect size to play game though little small for watching video it work perfect for daily use
the item i bought wa so great best buy is product are the best
this camera is a great addition to my home i really like it
perfect tablet such a great price would totally remmend
i really like my kindle i do wish it had so that you uld move book that you had read to another area or just mark them a read i read a lot and sometimes forget if i read the book it hold so many book and i cannotake them all anywhere
this is lot of fun you can ask it what to wear play you a song your calendar all while you re doing other thing so there is no wasted time however i am not sure of the privacy part of it i think it is always listening and we will start to get marketed due to what we talked about at the dinner table
i really enjoy this tablet made a great christmas gift
i loved the amazon fire stick but i enjoy the speed and k support of this product over the fire stick i have owned and tested appletv st gen boxee roku k chromecast nexus player and by far the amazon fire tv and stick offer the most and best ntent much of which can be used for free great layout easy to use and full of feature
you get amazon access with this which is pretty good but it wonmpare to an apple or android device when it me to apps my son ha one of these but his grandparent got him a samsung tablet and he doe not even touch his fire anymore he say because the apps are not a good it probably fine if you like amazon product reader etc but not a much for a lot of the game
amazon fire tv work great when you have family over your house get great activity for age to
i can watch ton of stuff in my tv who need cable now day
work great and i have not had any issue easy to use
this thing is awesome i am learning more everyday
we recently bought this tablet for my year old son and he love it it is easy to use have lot of apps available the ver is durable and it me with a year warranty the only problem for u is the battery wonlast overall an amazing tablet
this wa a christmas present the person that received it wa very happy with it she ha other kindles but this new one is an obvious improvement over the previous one
easy to setup easy to use work great and easy to get started love it
first this is a great product seriously there is no reason not to own one of these if you have an amazon prime acunt it is almost a must have setup is simple and once you add some of the skill to alexa it is a whole lot of fun we have a wemo light switch that it ntrols now that setup wa a bit more challenging but nothing you cannot get through play any radio station must genre tell you the weather help with timer in the kitchen and the shopping list function is a huge help let is talk about the shopping list a little you just tell alexa what you want to add to your list and it will all appear in list form on your mobile device in the alexa app a a check off list i ll give you one downside alexa seems to think the cnn news reporter are talking to her a they wake her up a lot
we use it for lot of thing the shopping list is wonderful anyone in the house can no add something to the list a soon a they finish the last item and it is sent right to my phone the to do list keep u on track the music option mbined with amazon prime music is awesome we use alexa every day we even play prank on each other i love to have alexa tell my husband a bedtime store about himself we laugh every time the kid and hubby will send note to my to do list like be sure to buy your daughter the new video game she want very user friendly two thing we would like changed the pause between when you say alexa and when you can say what you want is too long i also wish there wa to make an interm out of multiple unit we have a dot upstairs would love to be able to project my voice from one to the other rather than yelling to the kid or going upstairs
bought this for my three year old when i bought a new car with no tv in it she love that i can download show and movie and then watch others on wifi
good gift for someone got this for my girlfriend mom for xmas
it is not the fastest tablet but it is fine for what i use it for camera is not that great
i wanted a tablet that would be easy to carry for reading this exactly meet my need and expectation great tablet
light weight easy to use and stay charged much longer than my previous one paper white is easier to read in low light too

i m really happy that i purchased this amazon fire tv box it work great and so easy to use definitely worth the price
i have had amazon tablet in the past and this is the far worst i have bought it wa slow drained the battery kicking me out of the apps all the time
i love that this tablet came preloaded all we needed to do wa charge it and my child had access to many book at an appropriate level
i purchased of these for christmas gift our family ha several kindles and they have all been very good tablet they re great for all age too
this tablet is very user friendly it wa easy to use and a great value
i really liked this tablet got it for my nephew who just turned ha many built in kid rated apps which keep him entertained the bumper is a bonus in case he drop it too what i also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too
i got the amazon echo for a birthday gift and i love it it is easy to use and sound great
with the advent of technology picking up and reading a normal book feel cumbersome this device perfectly replicates real life ink whilst providing an unobtrusive backlight and enhancing the book with extra information dictionary and wikis

i purchased this product for my kid over the holiday i have been very impressed with the thing you can do with it among other thing i enjoy using it for listening to music checking the morning weather or a a simple kitchen timer
having a backlight make this the better choice plus the lighting is adjustable for brightness
easy setup and connect to wifi great viewing area easy to read in bright place
great tablet if you have an amazon prime acunt not able to download some apps that are current work better if you stay with in amazon
my mistake to buy for yr old but my yr old son enjoys it

steve wright is a well informed and very good rep for best buy steve assisted me in the selection and ordered this out of stock item just in time for christmas thank you
got this on sale for decent display but you cannotell it is not on par with other tablet it is great if you have prime and use their service great speakes make a huge difference in audio quality battert life is good no mplaints i gave it star due to the play store access there is a way around it i do have it on here now but it took some work
the new kindle paperwhite is such a great improvement love it so much
bought this for my daughter for christmas and she ha used it for untless hour she ha a small crack on the screen so i d definitely get a case for it
every time i use the echo i find there is something else that it can do there is not a day that i do not find use for it
capable to run game just a spected and very handly
happy with the purcase gift for my mother in law
picture quality is very clear good size to take with me i wished i would found a ver for this model at the store universal model doe not work a to i have to take ver off to use camera
this is a great piece of technology it ha k video output and all apps for apple tv are available also for this box
it work great for what i need not a fan of ad and that it sends e mail of all the apps i download but i just use it for a few apps
just hooked it up work great do not know how i ever got by without it
the battery life is amazing and quickly get a full charge
it is actually very fun and useful music information and helpful
the amazon fire tv model work really well the only negative thing is my remote stopped working after the first day but i downloaded the app on my phone and it work really well i have the box behind my tv and have no problem ntrolling it with my phone
love the shopping list feature weather report time listening to favorite music
good battery life i do not have any problem connecting to wi fi
based on the price it is easy to see that this tablet is not something that will knock your sock off but is good for child that like to read book
i use it mainly when i am traveling to read book watch movie listen to music play game and check email work very well and doe everything that i need
i bought this for reading listening book love the availability to expand the memory now i can load movie and ton of book

just right for my mom got it and put prime on it for her and netflix along with some game i think she like it
simple easy to set up and an all around great product
i am definitely happy with my purchase it is a very good android box even if most of the ntent seems to be amazon ntent with the ability to sideload install other android apps not from the amazon store this make one of the top android box also the ability to play some game make it a plus just buy a microsd card since memory is limited to gb on this box
this is not like the amazon echo however this speaker is loud and sound good but you will lose bass if it is at max volume not remmended if you like bass
doe the job doe the job great
would highly remmend for anyone looking for a tablet
the kindle fire is nice to use a a tablet to play game and surf the web a well a download and read book on it ha good speed keep a good charge and is affordable
my son just love watching movie on it very easy to use
the tablet is awesome easy to use at a good price
like the echo for quick information weather travel music it wa a gift for myself love it
here are my pro and n thus far pro perfect size for ebooks and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eye from my phone displaynice sturdy casing that give it a nice heft but still weighs in a one of the lighter tablet on the marketchild acunts amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kid making this a low st piece of tech that is perfect for school kid and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clan and how much he can hit the ol visa card for battery life thus far wife wa on it for about hour last night and battery wa at about kindle integration this go without saying but having my ebooks and audible book synced to the tablet is awesome and my kindle book look great
echo is an excellent gizmo for people on the amazon e system it doe ha many thing music weather news joke trivia bluetooth speaker good mics home automation integration calendar etc it lack an advanced capacity for web search which i suspect it is mpetition from google may have it also lack in smart tv integration some other nice to have would have been a battery in it making it a little bit mobile and integration with other intranet speaker overall a good idea and one that will get better over time
bought this to do reading and store pdfs great if you are a llege student that ha to read many article good luck
this ha expanded my viewing and allowed me to see movie that i had forgotten
this is a good tablet for kid and me with a good warranty
gave a a gift they love it there are new thing to love about it everyday
no issue since christmas work great east to use for a year old
best at it price just bought it because it le when mpared ot other leading tablet good for skype
i waited to buy this product to see what the review would have to say over time they were mostly upbeat and i am an amazon prime member so i said what the heck and gave the echo a shot i am glad i did i use it to listen to music and news intermittently throughout the night while sleeping i enjoy the sport update and the flash briefing i also like that i can simply ask to stream most any radio station and listen to the latest episode of my favorite pod cast echo is very responsive to my voice mmands this product is easily worth every penny you spend on it
alexa ha many ol feature i m enjoying learning how to teach her thing a well a identifying way to allow her to share ntent and information
easy to setup but doe not do everything without additional product better than google home
i love the easy access to all of the apps especially the netflix app
great addition for a tv without smart feature and great for game for kid
i purchased this table for my son to check email watch movie and play game he love it
my daughter absolutely love her tablet she is able to play all of her game and read book
i use this not just for amazon prime but i love the nvenience of adding other apps like netflix and sling no need for a dish outside the house to enjoy tv

bought this for my grandson and am very pleased with the quality the case protects it well
my daughter absolutely love her new tablet and it doe do everything i wanted it to do for her the free year of amazon freetime is an awesome bonus the only problem i have with it is that whenever your wifi get turned off and then back on your apps on the kid profile have to load again almost a if they have not been downloaded yet this happens if the wifi strength get weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is year old i wish that uld be fixed because other than that the tablet is great for my daughter and she ha so much fun with it i m sure other kid will love it also
i bought of these tablet one for my dad son and grandson and they all love it my dad who is year old and not mputer lit at all said it is pretty easy to use after it wa set up by my son for him
great tablet for the st doe all the basic function great these are email web surfing and social medium if you belong to amazon prime then it is even better since this thing make it easy to take advantage of the extra ntent you can access movie tv show music book a lot of this is free for prime member good idea and business move for amazon a it enurages amazon ntent and purchase the tablet itself is pretty good smaller and more narrow than an ipad easy to hold in one hand screen is nice for video reading web surfing and email if the ipad is setting the bar and is a i would give this an the weakest thing is the camera it adequate but you smart phone is better a feature it ha that the ipad lack is the ability to add an micro sd card for extra space it is also much cheaper than an ipad
this is a nice little tablet and great for the kid
work great easy to use and can easily be changed to android
my year old granddaughter love her tablet she u it to stay connected to her friend on fb and watch movie on it
perfect for kid with the child profile only downside is the limited space
i have had a kindle for some time and wa curious about the oasis it did not disappoint it is very mpact even with the ver and fit in a at pocket i really enjoy the size and the redesign which brings back hard button great device for home or on the go
this is an excellent option and it ha alexa built in
very helpful product help me with my appointment
this kindle is great for reading book which is exactly what it is designed for very crisp text in bright daylight or mplete darkness it feel good in your hand weight is balance it doe not feel flimsy either quick page transition when reading do not expect it to mpete with tablet in the app or visuals department because that is not what it is meant to be used for gave it star instead of because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at time
bought one last year for a christmas gift and it is amazing so i bought more this year for gift and they loved them
this wa bought to replace my old kindle with keypad and experimental internet wa surprised how much the kindle had changed and at the same price a my old one wa when i bought it have already shown it to a uple of friend who now say they are thinking about getting one

i bought mine in store i like having what i buy right away so i didnfeel the need to buy it online maybe that is why other people may have had a screen problem uld have been during the shipping process because who know how well the shipping mpany treat the package i use it mainly for watching netflix and reading book i love it feel like i have a kindle and whats great about it is that it more than just a kindle so i can do more with it i already have an iphone and a huge laptop so i wonbe using it for like everything like other people may need it for so it is worth the price because before i wa never planning on buying a tablet because i felt like they were expensive and since i already have a phone and laptop i didnneed it but when this came out i wa finally happy to find a tablet that the brand is well known and popular
i find this tablet very easy to use and easy to read at night
had a kindle before needed new one like the size
i bought a tablet few month ago is very good quality i like it a lot for watching youtube video and i bought more tablet for a gift
a great christmas gift the kid love the gift
i have owned an apple tv chromecast and now this this is my favorite of the because of the highest quality of streaming the one downside is that it is not mpatible with my echo dot
hold a charge better than any tablet i have ever had
we bought this to replace a kindle fire pad and they have me a long way in this build i would remmend this or if you like a bigger one then get then version
i bought it almost a month ago and i have no mplaints so far with it it is a nice little ereader that doe it job
i wa so pleased with my amazon tv stick on my guest room tv that i purchased the amazon tv for my other tv awesome awesome with those and the google chromecast i have the world of entertainment at my finger tip
is simple and easy to use also is perfect size for my purse or a carry on bag
i purchased the tablet for my christmas angel he loved the tablet and case
a very nice tablet for the price it ha everything the more expensive tablet offer one thing is not so pleasant the advertisement screen keep popping up and i so far uld not find a way of shutting this function down however overall i am satisfied
i give these tablet away for prize in our redemption store always sell out and a great value
use it for my shopping list and for timer use it for music and amusement
work okay a a tablet and especially to access amazon no good a a general tablet a there are no google apps available such a chrome gmail etc
i bought this tablet for one reason and it ha acmplished that perfectly to stop my year from nagging me everyday that he want a tablet i have not had to hear those word once in two week after month of nagging me had i know i uld get him a cheap one instead of an ipad i would have taken care of this a long long time ago star in my book
this wa given a a gift and recipient happy with it
this charger w rapid charger is a described it work well with both my fire hdxs a bonus is the angled usb connector which fit over the origami case making for a stable and secure connection a good deal
i didnneed to review the product because i alread had one i purchased the kindle for my wife for our anniversary and she love it the best part is you can read it outside in the bright sun or inside we rarely buy paper book anymore
all i bought this for is to wake up in morning easier it wake me during my lightest part of sleep within a minute window that wa what made me get this over fitbit

i found this device wa easy to hook up also easy to navagate perfect box for beginner and advanced user
grandson love this tablet doe everything he need
first of all this is not an ipad or a more expensive android tablet but it is a very good tablet for the money i own an ipad pro and ipad air yet this tablet ha a place in my home if you re buying for kid i would not buy anything more expensive than this good screen fast enough and amazon is underground free apps are a huge plus
got this tablet for my year old daughter and subscribed to free time to download all her favorite plus some new apps the only issue is that some thing take a while to install or load and sometimes freeze although i think that may be due more to my wifi and the fact that i have a ton of device on my network i only wish that it wa g or lte instead of wifi
i got this for on black friday which is the best deal for a tablet but still getting this for is a good deal
i bought this initially a an alarm clock i have now loaded it with a lot of skill i am enjoying using it for task and fun

this item is ok if your not looking for a big name brand tablet
this work great to my nephew for xmas this year it is easy to use and to set up price is great and i would remmend to my friend
i bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous kindles i purchased i am disappointed i like the price the home screen is just all the apps right in your face not just the one you want like in the older version kindle fire i mostly use it for reading book and so far i m dissatisfied it is great to swipe to the next page but when i want to go to setting or something else while reading i find it difficult to open instead the page just turn and by the time i finally get to the book setting i have lost my spot i downloaded the facebook app and it is very slow maybe it is amazon way of telling me that is what i get for but me on sometimes i like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow i mpared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed i know there are other ol user tool but for me i mostly use it to read and check facebook and maybe pinterest it is priced well if you want it for kid it is user friendly and my kid have already figured out all the option i would remmend it for kid or for people who are technologically not savvy
great improvement from the original version and much better than apple tv
enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good
super easy to setup i would even say you can cut cable tv if you put kodi on it i have several thought the house and it never seems to be slow

once up and running alexa can perform a variety of your typical assistant feature itâ ll set timer tell you the time set alarm tell you what your day look like from your connected calendar tell you about your mmute or the weather and answer question about all sort of thing
the amazon kindle fire is the best starter tablet on the market which i have purchased and gave a present to high school and llege graduate
it is the thing to have to go along with the crowd but it end up being very much underutilized i m sure it is capable of more than making a shopping list and doing a flash briefing but we do not have the time to learn other than that it work just fine
purchased a a replacement for a kindle and it function well a a kindle and a tablet
excellent for what i or family want to use it for and the price is nice
spiffy toy and ad they add more item to ntrol it will beme even better

i wa thinking about to get a device to read on train or bus kindle paperwhite is the best for me when mpared with others such a cellphone or tablet and even in this latest model it ha higher display density and brightness ntrol which is what i want so go ahead get one worth to have your trip full of fun

the kindle fire will not disappoint durable and easy to use we have kid using them all tied to the same amazon acunt so nvenient

i always feel like somebody is watching me and now with my echo i m positive big brother is
i uld have done without it you need to install a whole bunch of apps to have a mpetent alexa i guess echo would work better with a smarthome sometimes it ha a hard time with my accent
i m very happy i chose the amazon fire tablet it is easy to use and i easily got the apps i needed
my son is previous kindle fire hdx broke and i needed an inexpensive replacement this kindle fire hd wa a great replacement for only great resolution perfect size for a year old boy
bought this for my mom a a gift and she love it much easier than buying paper book
this is great for kid play movie and game and is relatively inexpensive the processor is not nearly a fast an ipad or iphone but st a fraction of the price and work great for kid

great tablet for anyone work perfect of urse i would rather have a but for the price this work great
we are still learning how to use the echo device but it ha lived up to all our expectation easy to setup and use
using the echo is very easy and it creates a great addition to any smart home
bought this charger for the kindle voyage and it great
i bought this same tablet for my child two year ago who were eleven and eight year of age they enjoyed it so much that i bought one for my eight year old godson
would not take a charge good thing i tried before wrapping it for christmas
alexa enable amazon e is awesome voice mmand device and great sound quality
this is indeed a great product touch sensitivity and overall performance offurse cannot beat other top brand but it is with a very good price
love the speed and the quality of this product watch all my show in great definition
work great several apps for my kid to choose from
this is our first tablet we were looking for a tablet to get u started and this is nice and inexpensive way to get started we will use this for a while to get used to the whole app thing
i am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly it is a kindle inside a kid proof case you have to set up child lock etc my biggest mplaint is most of the game that are available you have to be connected to the internet i wanted something to take to church in the car etc
we got kindle fire for our girl and we love them great purchase
rapid charge is always good
love the option it give me for minimal st i carry it with me when i travel
the kindle voyage is light weight slim easy to use and so far ha been a good product the page turn very easily and the light work very well the anti glare screen is the best
great overall with multipurpose function and good sound reproduction
it is perfect for kid and adult who want to take a tablet on the go and not worry so much it seam very durabale
it is a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kid or whatever the ad are annoying but then again you cannot expect too much with the price point however i would not remmend using this for any kind of work at all because it is very slow and finicky at time but if you re tired of giving your kid your phone tablet this is the product for you just make sure you take off your payment info maybe even make their own personal amazon acunt
bought this for my niece and it work perfect she easily navigates all menu and feature
went in for the firetvstick but left with this instead if you plan on using it a lot and not planning on moving it from device to device this is the way to go much faster and also ha sd card input we use it for kodi and it is much faster than the firetvstick i programmed for others
it is a cheap version to allow my wife to read book and such no pretense that it is anything like an ipad but it is doing exactly what it should do for the price point it is set at
a friend told me about this item and it is a great deal
if you like reading this is the thing to get so much better than tablet for reading
light weight is great screen is a little too small for some game
we purchased this for our yr old it is something to help with learning to read and write the big downfall is that even the free apps require you to purchase add ons to unlock more of the app
work great just wish it worked with alexia way more feature than apple tv
we love it so easy to install and use fun great sound perfect gift for anyone
we no longer have directv or anything else chose this to have something else to watch on tv if you are a prime member with amazon there are ton of show movie game etc to watch use
seems to be sturdy and lite weight for small hand
i have been researching the different kindles and decided on this one i think i made a great choice
a good if not better than many other more expensive tablet
easy set up work with all of my smart home product amazon music is good i remmend this product for all age
i wa setting up of the same tablet and this one would not connect to the wifi when i brought it back for an exchange there were none in store and they didneven have them on their website ended up getting a refund and purchasing the same model from amazon
after using the amazon fire tv for about two month i can say that this is an excellent streaming device i connected the fire tv to through the yamaha receiver to my tv therefore i get a perfect sound amazon service is acceptable except the fact that they kind of force you to buy different subscription or buy movie if you want to watch the new stuff on the market but here is the good news you can use the device even without an amazon subscription with netflix pb and so many other downloadable application with an gb usb flash drive formatted in fat this device may beme an ideal player connected to your tv
so far so good i am happy with the product i purchased
love this so easy to use and great for music or to get a quick question answered cannot wait to get it set up all the way to ntrol light etc
good value for the money love the kindle for reading
it is a very good product with great quality good
the echo is growing on me it can give you weather or traffic or sport sres all without lifting a finger it cannotell me how many step on my fitbit it is learning new thing all the time it great i remmend it the possibility are endless
alexa is for me an amazing product that give you fact play your music can read to you and do lot more my family love this new electronic assistant
i have a lot of reading to do a a teacher this is a perfect product and easy on the eye

great product a usually better screen and faster than my previous work with my chromecast easy to use
it is a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded game and watch cartoon
great product for those interested in a simple e reader and do not need to stream video
alexa is great some glitch with regnizing voice mmands or question but overall fun
best portable speaker i have ever owned i use this everyday mostly when getting ready in the morning or when i have guest over good sound quality and link to the alexa app just like an echo it me with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the echo also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux rd
love how it is easy kid friendly and my son loved it
i just purchased this kindle to replace my first generation kindle i am so happy with my purchase it is much easier to use read hold and charge it is a worthwhile investment
nice tablet for my year old daughter affordable charging battery can be frustrating at time normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hour to charge it is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge
easy to read book great for night reading easy to download book
once i understand how to use this it will be awesome
this is a decent ebook if you are only interested in book reading not a lored screen but so do not mpare it with any ipad pad good for reading good gift for senior citizen
bought it a a gift for my brother he love it and ha no mplaints
bought the echo tap echo dot phillips hue starter kit and a honeywell thermostat for my wife for her birthday she love it and so do i cant wait to add more automated product to it no need to have my phone out fumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature check weather play music etc i just ask alexa to do it while i ntinue at what i m doing also when the dot and tap are in the same room the one that is closest to you typically answer your request nice device that will only improve with time
a nice hand free versatile piece of technology to have in the house
thought this would be a great gift for the kid and the price wa right
it is a great tablet for the price i love the idea of shopping from my tablet
great product for security home system easy set up and usage
i wa looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly bonus it ha camera lol

the only bad thing i uld me up with would be the battery doe not last that long otherwise this tablet is great for the money doe everything an apple doe and can add to the memory witch is fantastic
i brought this one because that one i had still working but uld not sign up online
i purchased this for my nephew great activity and more for him to learn
the biggest reason to buy this item is the nvenience and battery life on those two item the kindle delivers it is not a paper white a i would like it doe lag a bit but overall if you are a book lover this will be a good add on for trip and when you want to read outside
i always wanted one of those but they were too expensive mpared to a tablet but now i am loving it

i purchased one a few week before purchasing this one sd card slot ver broke when trying to insert card decided to get another one this one is fine have to use tape to hold other one in
i have an ipad and find it very difficult to read book on the ipad a there is too much glare and the text is not sharp this kindle paperwhite is fantastic and the font and text is just like in a paper book it is easy to read and allows you to adjust to the perfect setting for one preference
do not know i bought a gift for my nephew we will see
we bought this for our toddler and so far seems to hold up well with them some quirky rule with amazon and acunts with product but overall good for what we need
is a good table for kid to play with to watch video and play some game with
i am extremely happy with the box well over the stick twice a fast twice a much ram and up to almost time a much memory
if you love to read this is a must only thing that i do not like is all the ad that pop up when the wi fi is open
still learning how to use all the feature searching is a breeze can search by many option have used it by actor movie title or show title it will bring back what is available and sometimes advises of other source ie netflix the voice search feature is a homerun no more typing in the name without a keyboard

for those of u that truly just want to read literature and do not necessarily need to browse the web this is a must have
wanted something cheap to bring on flight and this did not disappoint battery life is good and screen is average at best
this wa a gift for my friend and he absolutely love it he tell me all the time how his kid always want to use it
easy to use tablet good price great for beginner a well a intermediate user fun
battery life is excellent i like the backlight and found the screen easy to read although it is not quite a much like paper a some of the other review i read make it seem
if reading is what you do the most with your tablet this is good choice
didnwant to go to the site amazon wanted me to
bought this on a whim i really have enjoyed using it at first i wa not sure what i would use it for but over time i have found many u and way to enjoy it i m still learning i am able to interact with item i didnthink i uld interact with at first we will see how the it go in the long run
i have always been a reader and an early technology adopter but until now i have resisted moving to electronic medium when reading for pleasure now i wish i hadnwaited so long reading at night with the light off and instantly downloading a new book are my favorite aspect
i bought this tablet the kindle fire for my woman and she absolutely love it work flawless for all her need very well made doe not me across a a cheap tablet a absolute must buy for best tablet on the market hand down better than some i spent much more money on and in fact should i need one myself currently have a insignia flex gb i will buy one for me great tablet for kid a well for and the reliability great buy
the tab is very good for the price what is being offered allows to have separate kid profile a well so that they do not have access to unwanted stuff youtube app can be installed a well
love alexa it work so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many thing it doe
love this newer version of an e reader i had a kindle keyboard and loved it i finally wore it out after year this kindle is even better a you can read at night
i bought this a a gift on father is day weekend and he loved it it is a simple tablet that doe everything it is supposed to excellently perfect for reading and watching video and movie would remmend if you re not looking for anything too powerful
if you are thinking about getting the echo like we were and going back and forth of it buy one and you will not be sorry it is amazing
i have often said that everyone need staff unfortunately most of u cannot afford to have someone at our beck and call well with the echo and alexa you can and there is almost nothing it cannot do well except for picking up the dry cleaning but i suspect an amazon drone will do that soon too
these thang are amazing i have one and it replace my cable
an ok product bought on black friday for you get what you pay for run slow at time good for simple task
this device can do it all the device also ha nice voice mmand
won the kindle fire last xmas at work raffle gladly got this kindle fire for a bigger screen and better battery life love it
good for the price speaker work ok better with headphone
the amazon fire tv with alexa voice remote is a great product the setup is easy i do advise you to set up an amazon acunt prior to make the setup easy i am an amazon prime member but it is not necessary to use the firetv i also purchased the firetv stick for a nd bedroom i will tell you though the firetv is worth the extra money not only is the firetv still small but it ha k definition and you can use ethernet and wi fi the biggest difference between this and the fire stick is that firetv ha expandable memory excellent to add photo apps movie etc the app store on the device also ha game you can play on the fire tv and for an extra you can get a remote that look like an xbox ntroller
wa looking for something different but see such a good deal
bought to use with harmony hub to ntrol tv and it doe also very handy for thing you used to have to look up on the internet for example in the morning alexa what is he weather forecast for today
i really love the tablet my kid love them i remmend then to other people
happy with the purchase found it on sale uld not pa it up
i like how the software block site from opening if they are malicious site
this is used in a work environment our tech support team chose this particular tablet for all of u we use it for contact work trail rerd keeping and customer support and are very pleased with how much we can do with it i say excellent choice
nice product i can save my cell phone battery by using my tablet and search the web take picture and more
bought this for my year old son just so he can have some sort of electronic great for what he need
i like the paper white for reading because it doe not have the glare like all the tablet with lor and it make reading feel like you are reading from a paper book without all the weight
i didnknow if i would have much use for the echo but the more i use it the more i love it it cannot do some thing i wish it uld like change the lor of my hue light but it can dim them and turn them off and on i like it a lot and my son like it too
if you know anything about the android o and what you can run on it this is the device for you
pad buck for this tablet and have been happy with it used a an internet reader can play video with some lag and buffering
read most of the review didnsee anything about ad or i may have been blinded on how cheap it wa there are ad at the lock screen and the pop ups from free apps the several apps i have download would always pop up got me annoyed so i returned it besides that it is pretty smooth operating smoother than galaxy tab a
the kid really enjoy this they play for hour on them keep them occupied
i bought this for my year old son and he love it
the kindle fire is a great tablet you can do lot with it and it seems well made
i really like the voice ntrol it take all the effort out of doing search without the annoying on screen keyboard
alexa can definitely be useful with creating shipping list entertaining guest and integrating into a smart home if you have young child it can be a little frustrating a they tend to mpete for ntrolling the device and there is no way to have alexa ignore a mmand given to it specialty mmand line can be nfusing if you do not get the studying right overall it is useful for most thing and the music service it connects to allow for a wide variety of entertainment
my niece love this tablet i love the amazon add on that let me ntrol what she can do how long she ha per day and when it turn off for the night turn on in the morning
this is much faster then the firestick will work with amazon echo voice remote work great
this tablet is much faster than my nexus a perfect replacement at a great price
not a quick a my ipad but a great solution for traveling some of the apps that you get on an ipad are unavailable happy purchaser
my son bought this and he love it and it is cheap
it is very good for kid who are looking for reasonable st
i had two kindles previously i think rd gen white one with keyboard cheapest kindle i won uple year back from a raffle and finally purchased this paper white so much easier on my eye and my wife doe not get bothered by a little bit of light it produce i wa a casual reader who read one book every quarter and with paper white i read book a month minimum
great tablet for a great price and size would highly remmend
it is still nfusing trying to figure out how to use alexa and the app to me alexa doe not answer many question at all or she doe not understand many question at all but i just need really be able to sit down and play around with the app is real funny though
my kid enjoy reading and watching video on it good lor

she initially didnthink she would like it a she preferred reading an actual book she changed her mind after a uple of day and now really prefers it easy to use
i have never had a problem with kindle and would remmend them to anyone
best tablet for the price by far it also nveint they have it in stock at best buy
i got this for my girlfriend a a christmas present and she ha not been able to put it down
the kindle fire is an excellent tablet for the price each member of my family ha one and they meet all our need and hold up very well
i use this all the time at home usually for radioandpod cast alexa usually understands me and doe what i ask
i wa very interested in the echo and respective echo dot based on potential functionality while there are some good quality the overall voice automation and functionality have not lived up to the hype yet pro sound quality for music is fantastic kid enjoy asking alexa question overall family fun n even after a full month of learning my voice alexa ntinues to frequently answer i do not know what you are asking at random time alexa will start talking without any prompt setting up additional ntrollable item and syncing are not a easy a amazon would have you believe and worst experience every time an amazon echo mmercial me on tv to promote the product my alexa reply to the tv mmercial a if it were me saying alexa
easy connection and very good playing different apps
i have to unplug it and wait sends every time
product ha been great we use the amazon echo for almost everything

cannot find a better tablet for the price not hd but good enough expandable memory is very nice

my son ha a st gen ipad and some of the newer game wonwork for that operating system i wanted a decent tablet that uld play those game without locking up and not be a expensive amazon came through with this great product to meet my need
this is the best tablet for a kid tablet the modified android operating system with amazon feature built in is great i am reviewing for what it is a kid tablet it ha a gigahertz processor meaning for such a small device that decently enough internal memory is gig but you can expand to gigabyte you wont run out of memory it ha a megapixel camera that shoot in p meaning not full hd or k again if you bought it for a camera you d be wrong but for a kid year to year old that is good it ha gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed game our year old is not playing any heavy graphic game that take up the cpu and gpu it came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she ha thrown it a few time excitedly and it did it job it ha no resource hogging gps or radio but it doe have bluetooth and wi fi
granddaughter love it she play on it daily and downloads the game with no problem
i bought it for my fianc and he cannot get enough of it awesome purchase
this is great for a reader i wa hoping to get a kindle paperwhite that had internet access through a browser from i cannotell that option is not available but we definately wanted the paperwhite
my husband and i have really enjoyed our echo more than we even thought we would love the ability to turn light on off along with monitoring our nest
not a whole lot to say it doe what i wanted it to do and work well with my prime subscription love technology and i also own apple tv i prefer apple product a a whole but this doe well also if you have amazon prime and no preference towards apple product i prefer the fire tv over roku
ol tab must buy for kid amazon need load apps
not sure of quality his first kindle fire would no longer charge properly it wa cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed he ha already had a problem with this one charging properly however i believe the problem might have been with the charging rd and not the tablet itself
i bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas i m amazed with the performance of this tablet it is fast the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything i need camera and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me i do not take pic with my ipad and usually use headphone free game from amazon underground free amazon cloud for three month a the peace of mind it gave me made this purchase a great decision it also make a great reader love this little gadget
i already own a nvidia shield but needed a cheaper option for my son room to run netflix and kodi the amazon fire tv run both great no lag and look great
easily accesible wonderful for my kid stay charged long time
wanted to replace my fire stick and it wa on sale
this is a great device for entertaining at home or just lounging on your own

perfect for kid reading internet netflix and game
he love it and can watch anything he want on his own tv
so it is working great she love the learning game
had to purchase another kindle because my current one had reached it memory capacity
i wa skeptical about the fire o apart from being a window phone user and then used android a little on nexus tab i found fire o a little annoying and not easy to use but then just after try you get used to of and work fine the tab is fast with quad re processor and good ram i wa thinking to install android i bought two of these so the one which i want to gift someone i ll install android it although i myself will try fire o for a while and then decide
i ll never go back to book very easy to use and mfortable on the eye
i love the amazon white for it size and lighted screen
bought this a a christmas gift for my grandson he wa thrilled to receive it and ha not put it down i m also glad it came with a power rd

amazon make great product it is that simple clean graphic
good entry level reader that is easy to use the resolution is great for that page turning novel ha lot of other bonus too
i love it it wa a gift for my niece she u it a lot to extreme movie battery hold up very well
this tablet is a great tablet for the average user it ha decent sound quality and work great a a reader
if you re an amazon prime member and are looking for an easy streaming box for the whole family to use this is it the lack of a few apps is a bit disappointing but amazon is expanding their library a time go on so be patient
it is nice and simple easy to carry around if you have child it not bad when traveling
ordered for my daughter to replace an older version and she love it larger screen and lored case are a big plus
work awesome wa hesitant at first not sure how it work but after playing around with it for a while you figure out all the ol thing it can do
the resolution and ntrast of the screen are excellent but the real selling point are how easy it is to read in natural light including bright sunlight and the battery life i have only charged it once since i got it about week ago
i bought this for my wife basically just for reading book she ha me to love it she is nstantly reading lighting wa not an issue or i would have gotten the reader when she is not reading i borrow it for puzzle type game and it is great not a ipad by any stretch but it is more nvenient than the mini that she also owns prior to the amazon fire she wa reading on the iphone a
i really love the fire tv i use it all of the time if i m not using it my kid are using it great for all age
i love these work great nothing like plug and play
i bought this for my granddaughter because it wa small enough to be carried around big enough for her to read book on and her favorite lor it is sturdy in case she drop it she is very happy with it and u it all the time plus it wa on sale and i got it for the same price a a black one normally blue sts more do not know why but that is the story
my hole family love it we do not even watch cable tv any more
good value tablet make a good remote for firetv often cheaper at other vendor though
very nice assistant except for the alexa mmands are just in english
it a awesome tablet and very durable for child
wa looking for a tablet with expandable memory that wa reliable amazon tablet wa the best choice
i seen the mmercial and had to have it my husband and kid got me this for mother is day i m so happy and love it
i bought this thing thinking it is a ol little gadget but i have to admit she ha the ability to do a lot of thing it is like siri on steroid with the appropriate item she is able to turn on off light order thing through amazon and they just announced that she will soon be able to interact with the bmw i the kid especially love it they just wish she can do their homework
i am pretty impressed with this amazon fire tablet i have had many ipads over the year currently have an ipad air and this fire tablet is very nice great screen very responsive lot of option reliable wifi i cannot believe this thing only sts buck this may replace my ipad
simple to use and setup for a year old toddler
echo is ok but i am just not seeing the product value provided for the st many time alexa doe not understand what we are saying and is extremely frustrating to my wife and child speaker sound is good quality but not at all impressed with the ai capability
i absolutely love my new kindle tablet i love the size and feel of it it ha auto blue shade i can set it for what time i want it to dim
being an amazon prime member this little box made a great addition
i love this tablet one of the best out there on the market
my son love it easy to use and download book requested for his birthday gift
great price bottom of device ha shadow where the light are that is a little annoying not sure why they cannot avoid this doe not interfere with the reading experience
we bought these for our grandchild they were a hit
we bought this for our yr old kid it is easy to use and the battery last for several hour
this is the send fire i have owned and have found them to be a good reliable tablet
kindle fire is a good product i am happy with my purchase the only difficulty wa buying book it wa difficult to understand initially
this is an item i use every day i bought one for my mother in law who is paralyzed and she love it
i love the amazon fire i am able to play all my movie and show on my fire it is great
i have bought this item because i wa previously using the firestick and i wa happy with those but the streaming would buffer a bit more than i d like so a friend of mine remmend it to me sand said little to almost no buffering and it is exactly that little to no buffering even when streaming from my iphone it is an amazing device i really like it
good movie kid run fast efficient ol tablet
the family really enjoys the amazon tap this is an awesome investment we talk to alexa everyday
extremely easy to view no light needed just what i wa looking for
great product a advertised very easy to set up profile with daily goal and limit great purchase
work great have had no issue at all love it
the tablet is not for me it is for a christmas gift
that is an average tablet with nsiderable spec for the price it star fast run apps fast and the battery last for a while around hour of average use the only limitation for me is that it doe not have google store if you have bought any app from that store you ll have to buy them again from amazon store but there are tutorial online teaching how to have google app store working on this tablet
if you are looking for something inexpensive for your kid this christmas this is the one easy to operate good quality and size for kid and adult
i am really enjoying alexa with my echo i bought my mother in law one for christmas also and she love it
i got this for my year old great grandson for game and education he really enjoys it
fun it doe everything a advertised favorite purchase in a long time still disvering more and more thing that the echo is capable of but i totally love this
highly remmended only flaw is it need more data to draw from
kindle fire is affordable for everyone love it
the sound quality of the speaker in my opinion is not worth the extra st versus a echo dot i uld spend the difference on a separate speaker to use with the dot and also have the flexibility of using that speaker elsewhere
great product
i like this tablet very much except that they have a game or app one ha to clear before one get to the main screen other than that the battery last a long time and it mpact and easy to use
like the fact i can watch netflix on it daughter loved theirs
the kindle is the best e reader on the market bright screen and great selection of book
awesome tablet performance great perfect buy
other kindle had a hole in screen from kid upgraded to the paper white screen work great
after experimenting for several month with an echo dot i decided to take the plunge when the echo showed up online at a deep disunt like the dot setup wa easy sound quality is awesome sometimes it work too good a it listens to everything all the time itâ is going to be fun to use just the same
although the price point is a bit high for what it is i love the new kindle the screen is beautiful the back light with auto adjust dimming is great and it feel very sturdy to hold i am very glad that i upgraded form the nook but can only give star due to price
excellent product that doe what it is built to do and that show great movie purchase this product roku and this is a much better product love that i can watch other streaming apps a well on this device
this is a great streaming device definitely worth the extra st mpared to the fire stick apps open instantly and operates flawlessly
i love the versatility of the echo it ha a great music sound and doe so much more
this is great to turn an ordinary tv that ha an hdmi port into somewhat of a smart tv
great for kid that mostly play game and stream video
i wa using chromecast but this is a far better delivery system a far a picture quality and reliability also more choice of programming of urse
i like this product and most anything from best buy the product is easy to operate
this tablet wa bought for my year old he love it and it is great there is one caveat though it is loaded with ad everytime the tablet is turned on or screen locked there are amazon ad because of this i now have a new vacuum that wa accidentally ordered so make sure click buying is disab k ed
i originally bought the tablet because i enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzle not having time to do them at home i found apps that i uld use on the cell phone while on the train but anything more than piece wa just too many for the screen i have found that i can do piece puzzle mfortably on the kindle and for the amount of puzzle available and the time i can spend on them that is good enough for me but the kindle offer so much more there are other great game and puzzle apps from the app store plus there is a six month free trial subscription to the washington post you can go online via wifi and download book read email watch movie and video and surf the internet just like on a regular mputer it is great fun
this wa very easy to use and set up and it is fun to have around the house
this is a great tablet for my elderly mom mpact but easily readable
work great connected it to wi fi speaker and light i think went and got a dot and connected that through a bluetooth adapter to my old stereo system and that work great a well
we have fire stick and fire tv this is a great into love the voice search remote need to be able to access apple itunes you will not be able to stream vudu and apple on this device remmended we are amazon prime which i also highly remmend to maximize value for this product
i am very happy with my amazon fire tv i set my year old daughter to install it and she had it up and running in a matter of a uple minute
this product work very well and the price is reasonable
very easy to use and to set up all you need is a tv
purchased mainly to use travelling so have not really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point it wa advertised a capable of downloading movie and book so you can watch read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fee or having to purchase wifi during flight
gecksqd helpful in understanding different thing
this device really allows you to use it for multiple reason it is a tablet and kindle all in one i love this device
good enomic solution for a tablet to surf the web when neeeded
bought for my son a a birthday gift and a a way to not wear out his laptop work great especially for video and general online use

i love it long battery life easy to use perfect
had the amazon fire tv box fox week and it broke
i like this much better than the roku that we had and more option
this is not a great tablet obviously it is not even a pretty good tablet what it is is a really solid tablet that at is basically disposable i take this thing place where it might get stolen or broken because if it doe i m only out nsequently i use it a lot more because it is not so precious also the ability to download movie from prime and watch them off line make this guy the perfect subway tablet
awesome product work great good for listening to music asking question connecting to smart device and much more
it work great and fun great to use cannot wait to buy some acceries going to get prime
i own a high end system with appletv and chromcast medium player for netflix and the like i purchased fire tv for k a with other device i thought i uld nfigure it and forget it this is not the case with fire tv remote ntrol requires nstant attention open the back play with battery but battery ver back on nstantly hdmi port doe not work with hdmi switch it is the only device that i own that doe not play well with my switch internet connection is poor start receiving video wonload error after a week i thought perhaps wifi connection wa bad even though no other device had this issue so i tried wired connection and got same error tried restarting it more than any device should need but this did not help device is very hot it is on nstantly no automatic method of turning off when not being used on the plus side the interface is the best i seen on any medium player beautiful picture and screen saver which can be nfigured alexia rock but limited to basic mmands amazon prime integration is excellent a you might expect beautiful looking device after about day i got fed up and returned it i ll wait for appletv to integrate k hopefully that will be soon
this tablet is great for reading the text is not a good a it is on my tab is in but this is about cheaper i got it because i wanted a more natural book feel reading my book and the tab is wa not doing it for me
faster and good quality for this kind of brand
it is a ol gadget my kid love to ask alexa to tell them a joke or play them a song i enjoy having alexa set a alarm when needed a i m bad about charging my phone which would be my usual form of alarm otherwise
i somehow feel like the google home would be more intuitive than alexa you ask her a question and her answer is i do not understand the question she say that more often than answer a question her hearing speaker is also not that great need to be improved upon great ncept when linked with harmony hub elite can ntrol more of your medium device like tv receiver projector game nsoles cable box but cannot do any of these with out the hub linked to it if you purchase the smart device such a the lutron caseta lighting ntrols nest thermostat she can ntrol your lighting too i gave her a four because she can do all that once programmed rrectly which can be a tedious process but once done she seems to work just fine just need a few improvement amazon
this tablet is perfect for the kid easy to use dependable and affordable

this item is useless to play music through voice regnition unless you pay for an amazon prime or amazon music acunt once that is disnnected she only play your music through manual ntrol from a blue tooth connection from your phone pointless more than half the question i ask her she doe not know the answer to the only thing she is good for so far is the time and weather that basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock i have ever purchased i want my money back
this is way over priced
for a tablet yes please i gave it a whirl and what a great tablet for the st it pretty quick in the apps i thought it might lag or be a little slow i wa wrong
i started with a very old original kindle amd have been debating for well month if i should upgrade i kept putting it off my husband tell me i wa dropping subtle hint all the time and he finally decided to pick it up for me and surprise me with it i wa at first a little put off with the rather high price but honestly once i started reading and playing with it it is definitely worth it this version more than the one fit my style and in my opinion is better than the pricier one you wonbe disappointed

quite light easy to nceal easy to use and quite quick
i think the ncept is modern work well most of the time we have had to pair it several time but that may be our internet service the most frustrating think is when you have named the bulb and say alexa hallway light on off she doe not understand what you are saying and repeat something totally different
this is great for streaming plex to tv is no hassle perfect quality for a fire stick
never thought i would buy something like this but absolutely love it
i purchase a fire after my nook died i had problem with the first one saying i wa connected to the web but not being able to connect took it back and the geek squad looked at it and after trouble shooting for a while they decided there wa something wrong with it so i exchanged it for another one we set it up and it worked initially then i went home and the same thing happened a with tg first one so i took it back and got my full refund while not happy with product best buy customer service made me happy

great tablet great performance and is stable i have ipads and other tablet and i really enjoy reading and watching show on my kindle fire v any other tabletthe kid version is kind of annoying so many apps ugh and kid dont understand that they have to wait longer if they re going to download apps at one time
this is such a nice tech thing even the kid can operate and nice for the google challenge
i use this tablet just for entertainment purpose on all amazon apps
absolutely love the fire tv i first purchased the fire stick which doe just what it should but the fire tv is awesome faster bigger
it work great bought for my wife for christmas and our whole family love it
simple to set up worth the expense fully mpatible and work fairly well with xfinity mcast
i bought the version on impulse because of an excellent offer on black friday a an amazon product it offer amazon apps while you can get google play apps it requires some hoop i just disvered i cannot save movie from netflix because that only applies to the hdx version so this product ha limit but used a a kindle reader or to get email via wifi or other u wifi only while traveling where you would not want to take an expensive device it is a good choice
this tablet is awesome hd resolution fast processor and affordable highly remmended
i bought the amazon echo for my husband because he love music i wa expecting the sound to be okay but not for it to sound a good a it doe the speaker are of excellent quality he is very pleased with the quality of the sound a am i even though we use the amazon echo for mostly playing music telling the forecast and adding item to our shopping list to be perfectly honest id love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and i hate having to unplug and move her
this is the third kindle fire in my household but the first kid is edition i absolutely love this thing it is very intuitive if you have ever used another android style device my year old and year old both have a their own profile each linked with different movie game setup wa pretty easy with choosing preferred ntent based on character theme appropriate for their age group moving our disney and other digital pie of movie wa equally easy after signing in the battery last about hour before needing a charge which is plenty for our use the biggest mplaint is that the micro usb connection is not the best the rd ha a tendency to me loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount i have seen this problem with other kindles a well this is aa bunch problem if you think that you re charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down it also make it very difficult to use during a charge the amazing amount of ntent that you get from the amazon library with the included year is nice a well my year old get to try a bunch of game that i otherwise would not let him try since i d have to pay and he most likely get tired of after minute overall i d say the best kid tablet out there
these were purchased a christmas present for my grandchild however i did open the package to be sure they were fully charged and updated i wa surprised at how fast the response time wa and how easy they are to navigate my grandchild are going to love them
i got this for my kid and they love it it not slow very fast easy to use user friendly
fantastic display and easy to use putting the device in rest most leaf an ad on screen which i do not care for nice long battery life

this stick run fast and smooth with alot le lag than the original if you want to the best the nvidia shield is the best
alexa work very good ntrols my thermostat tv light and even tell rney joke
this is the first e reader i have gotten and i love it in general kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you the page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you do not like the sensor on the side when you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad which is kind of annoying but it is not really worth it to pay to have the ad taken off again just something to get used to it is really easy to navigate you can even highlight and take note i do not really now too much about other e reader or kindles but i m really happy i bought this and i d remmend it to anyone
is good alexa i remed all people buy sound good
excellent amazon fire stick set up wa a snap it is great that you can speak into the mic to search for a title of a movie or show rather than typing it
they have me a long way since i purchased the first kindle fire it is a worthy successor and a very good tablet for the budget nscience person
this is great for reading book or letting your kid play game and keep them off your phone
i needed an extra charger for our cabin so that we would not have to pack one back and forth arrived just in time and on time that i got it in time for our next trip over work like the original
we bought this for our year old daughter great variety of apps book and educational video for her to explore love the feature that allow u to ntrol her time spent on it my only mplaint is that it processing speed is quite slow getting between different menu but at this price and for a year old i cannot mplain too much
mostly music are paid subscription not started home automation like switch ntrols
love the echo hear music ask for news update get direction for anywhere i want to go
not easy to setup everything is apps which you must memorize the direction need to take a urse to use not user friendly
very rugged design my niece absolutely love this
we bought this tablet for our year old to play game and watch netflix he love it and at this price point we re not overly ncerned if he damage it we bought a nice foam case that keep it well protected we re highly satisfied
already had one alexa went and bought another and a uple of dot now we can drop in to different room
alexa is really great we also bought the phillips hue light and the hub is tickled to death the grandson like the short story she tell with his name we really like this
this wa a replacement for a well used kindle wife like it even better than her first and u it a lot
work great flixster is a little slow mpared to vudu but at least i can still view my movie from vudu
best buy matching price wa great it did match the price offered by other vendor thats why i always go to best buy for all my gadget need
though it is entry level tablet it is not cheap technology amazon esystem is very mpetitive with google and they re ahead with more rapid product line fire tablet is the proof of that you can also get advantage of alexa
bought this for my husband primarily so he uld get the wall street journal it work great and he love that it hold a charge nice size durable great resolution etc it turned out to be a great gift
my kid are and and love their kindles i would remmend
esay to read screen and fast operating systemgreat for a young adult
great gift idea nice addition to the kindle family
bought to use for recent travel wa able to download several movie and tv show from netflix seems to have decent storage video playback wa fine
so far daughter really like it and it alexa sang her happy birthday had no problem with getting it started either
great product no issue i remmend it for all user
i wa tokd if you had wfi there would be no problem to make it work wrong i already gave it to the person and they cannot make it work they do not have a smart phone but have mputer and wifi im afraid i will have to return the item
my son love it he can watch video read book and play game
very happy with my product best buy staff wa extremely helpful
loved the gift my daughter cannot put it down kid friendly
i boufgt it a a gift to my granddaughter and she u it for school work daily
this is the perfect portable device i believe it to be much better then ipad or in my opinion rival it
great tablet for the price and work really well cannot go wrong with this tablet
great tablet for kid very entertaining and informative for kid learning
awesome tablet just what i wanted for my son he ha loved it
having so much fun with my echo it is full of thing to do once you get used to how to ask it you have to say the name of the skill before you can ask a question once you get the hang of it it is great there is still so much more that it can do that i have not yet disvered you wonregret this purchase
great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi
the tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we re avid apple user however the game that is are free in the free time area are amazing the way that amazon take measure to keep the kid safe is like non other i d definitely remmend this product just if you re used to apple it will take some getting used to
work great for the price i use it mainly to watch video or read newspaper magazine article for much else it would be too slow
ha all the major streaming channel and is lightning fast highly remmended
alexa is fun a bit biased to amazon product example when i scream at her to play a song she will play it from amazon music and not my spotify unless i instruct her to which is not terrible but just a head up she is way quicker than your phone for finding answer to thing but the algorithm to get exactly what you re looking for is still being worked on so do not expect her to always find the right answer she is still a great product and fun
my kid really seem to like this i really like the ability to set usage time which help them learn to budget their time
this is a great little tablet for my son it is easy for him to navigate through and it also ha parental ntrols i can ntrol how long he u it and what he read
i use it for everything i listen to music all the time this make it easier and clearer the weather the news i uld go on and on i love it and would buy it again in a heart beat
i have had some issue with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issue i work and go to school i do not have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed
purchased this for my nephew for christmas after reading review i think this will be a good device for reading book and listening to music
nice tab for young kid getting use to using tab fully functional and fairly easy to use
this is a great product alexa never let you down
after purchasing amazon fire tablet i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that i bought there is always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wake up my other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchase for some apps for my kid i removed the ability to make purchase without a password well that did not actually happen for a few day my child were able to make purchase in apps without any prop that said are you sure or asking for a password i have had to mpletely remove the acunts and reinstall a different acunt for them to be able to stop making purchase i also had them transfer the purchase to the new email a big hassle overall the tablet work good great for the kid
the product ha limitless possibility with wireless mmunication between light thermostat and lock if desired
wa looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black friday good unit
love the larger speaker work great use a a music source mostly
set up wa simple and wa very pleased with the picture quality that streamed to the tv and since you can watch amazon prime movie even better
i wa a little skeptical at first about the amazon tap but after disvering how easy it wa to set up i wa able to connect to my music library with ease great sound and nice to have the portability to take with me
love to listen to my echo have to learn to talk to alexia so she can understand grate for party just tell alexia what to play and the party is on no balky item to carry or to set up just plug into a outlet wait for the echo to warm up after that it ready to play
not bad can with stand my almost yr old daughter wrath of every day wear and tear so it is a win for me
nice tablet the lors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that me with it are terrific something for all age and very simple my niece and nephew are and and they are finding it very easy to use the hard rubber ver is a great extra i had to buy a ver for the last tablet and it st over for something that sturdy and protective excellent product
i m writing a review based on the problem i had with my kindle hd it would not hold a charge even though amazon try to reboot it from their location or had to technician try to reboot it but it would not me on so i m just want to say that the charger doe work when i plugged it into my samsung phone with the power rd so that is why i give it star
i purchased this tablet for my grandma and she wa able to learn to use it right away this is a great tablet for someone who is a beginner when it me to technology
i never thought i would ever purchase a kindle device for reading book but now that i have one i wish i would have done this a long time ago i enjoy being able to read anywhere plus being able to purchase a book anytime i want is such a nice feature
love this amazon fire tv i hooked it up to my bedroom tv and started watching all of my favorite show on netflix and other apps that me on this great

this is my send amazon fire tv and i absolutely love it work great for streaming amazon prime show movie netflix hulu and hbo go i do not have cable and with all of those program i save money and get all the entertainment i want
overall for an alexa product it doe the same thing a all the other one this one is specifically portable and only need to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it doe not listen to you unless you press any of the button on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i uld see it causing excess battery usage need to be able to apps better
run flawlessly love the fact it is not just wi fi enabled
tmtis is the send tablet i purchased for my kid it perfect for all the thing my kid do
i absolutely love my kindle fire i received cash back for purchasing a new macbook pro retina laptop and purchased the kindle and ver jacket

the tablet wa a great fit for my month old toddler she is able to watch episode of her favorite cartoon and play some of the apps with assistance i like that she will be able to use the tablet for year to me just by updating to more age appropriate apps
it is fast and easy to use this is my send kindle fire
great item lot of fun hahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha
this is a good tablet for basic function it wa smaller than i expected we had a fire when they first came out and i wa thinking it would be the same size the screen size is very small but i guess that is why it wa instead of more expensive it is good for reading basic game and kid but if you want to surf the web it is really hard to see more than the top few inch of the webpage it is great with the g but would like a bigger screen for that price
my wife bought this for my year old son after his nabi tab went south overall ha been a solid purchase
price is nice but performance wa not sluggish to the point of frustration even to my year old would be fine a ereader or maybe basic web device
the amazon fire is a perfect buy and at a great price what my son love best about the fire is that it ha a camera the older version doe not i would highly remmend this the fire
i needed a tablet which i can use without worrying about damaging it this is perfect for that purpose
it is no ipad but it is great for netflix and some app game i m not worried about the kid getting their paw on it since it is relatively inexpensive
it is a really good tablet for the price i wa amazed if you re on with the amazon app store aka underground then you ll love this tablet
the amazon tablet is priced amazingly however the tablet need to be restarted nstantly to find a wifi connection
work great for my daughter great price and apps

great tablet i bought for my grandkids and now another for another grandkid
it is okay so to speak it doe what it say it will i feel it ha much more potential however and look forward to update
i thought i would love my amazon echo before i bought it but now that ive had the chance to use it it just not such a big deal
i bought this tablet so i had a smaller tablet to take place i absolutely love it
the echo is now the third device in our growing echo household we started with an echo dot for christmas last year we loved it i bought an echo tap for my husband for his birthday to be able to take in the yard or garage while he work outside we now have the original echo and love it just a much having multiple echo in the house allows u to use it a an interm with the new drop in feature also love the new multi room audio that wa added with the latest update
great purchase it doe everything a expected very easy to setup
i bought this ha a gift for my kid they love their amazon fire a few down side with the internal memory and speaker pretty weak in these area the memory and speaker definitely uld use some upgrading fortunately the device ha a slot for memory card and we can connect to a bluetooth speaker to get the maximum use of the device you need amazon prime mpared to netflix prime is very mpetitive

work exactly a i hoped and have had no issue there is virtually every app you might need available to you

i m loving how easy it is to load my paper white with book and take it along on a trip or to the pool i have used it on a recent cruise and it wa perfect i uld read at night in the cabin and not wake my husband since i didnneed to turn on any light the ease of use ha inspired me to read more which is nice
we purchased this for our son who start school next year this is a great upgrade from his nabi my only mplaint would be the memory or lack there of it is expandable so i highly remmend a micro sd
this is a good tablet for the price however it run slow and the touch screen response is not the best this is not the right tablet if you re looking for a high speed high performance tablet

i bought a new visio and it doe not ha e the smart tv that is integrated now you have to use a tablet which would be ok but i have to sync all the time and it is annoying amazon fire tv is awesome much faster than the integrated program on the tv i love it allowed me to cut the cable
my daughter like the tablet and she use the tabet everday
i am not a casual user of on demand ntent and device having tried smart tv is from brand smart dvd bluray player apple tv wdtv htpc chromecast and too many other mpeting product to mention for streaming ntent before this box you really had two option for a simple to use box that doe not require additional item or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limit the ntent you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lack a lot in feature a well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple product that unlock feature like amazon is ntent the send option you uld nsider wa roku which really mean a roku box since it is head and tail better than past roku box in term of remote and speed now roku stand out with the most ntent and the most feature of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summary of other option to make sure everyone know about the other option out there wdtv are great for streaming your own ntent but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other item to use no remote included is limited to channel acrding to their own site with other ntent broadcast via chrome is browser not at the same quality level this doe allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the st but is more of a niche market than firetv roku apple tv but if you can live with the short ming it is worth a look at the price of these device smart tv most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly a pleasant to use daily like separate box read more
the tablet work good for my son with the game he use
paperwhite excels while reading on sunlight like beach etc i strongly remmend it
tablet is easy to use give option for password a well a a protective case star
excellent product at a great price highly remmended
got this a a step up from the fire stick and can definitely tell the difference no lag great device they have recently pushed an update which ha cleaned up the interface for the better we also have roku which is also great
i use an iphone but i needed a reliable android machine to play many android game i have purchased this fit the bill and run android fairly well for the price do not expect to push too much power out of this model but with some clever tweaking you can get this thing to bypass the fire o and do all your android app need
i have about every single streaming player on the market this one is not better or worse than the others i got it only for using rd party apps for that it work flawlessly if you need a streaming device this one will fit the bill

i know a lot of the ability of the amazon echo is more than i know if there wa a real tutorial available this would probably be a great product
i debated buying the new kindle oasis since i have owned every kindle since the first release it wa worth the money a the form factor is the best yet it is mfortable to hold in one hand and the text is crisp and easy to read
alexa still ha a lot to learn she doesnt know enough about sport and tv listing
no bell or whistle but doe what i want for the price
perfect just need an app to locate when set aside
the amazon kindle is a great device for any reader it is simple to use and fit the purpose operating system is a little slow mparing to other device but get the job done
this is awesome addition to the stationary echo i cannotake this out in the yard or garage when working outside great sound and long battery
have a firestick and now a fire box and i am impressed with both product the box however is a much more superior product the speed is extremely noticeable and the expandable memory slot are a bonus the ability to hardwire directly into my router make for buffer free streaming well worth the extra money

overall the tablet is well nstructed and well engineered the excited factor for my son wore off quickly including the included app service nothing negative to report but nothing unexpected in a positive sense either
i like this much better than the fire stick great for alexa
i like it a lot it doe what it say it will do and that is awesome

this is a very good product the speaker are good the price wa right i liked everything about it other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it unlike the echo and the dot the portability wa good but i didnhave much use for it being portable unless you are going to keep the tap within arm is reach you re better off with one of the other hand free voice activated product remmended with caveat
not bad for an entry level nsumer decent for kid with a bumper and adult that are not super tech savvy
nice product
i wa hesitant at first to purchase the echo bec of my experience with the apple siri but i asked around from people who ha it and i got good review alexa is always there to answer me quick response and uld understand even people with accent great product specially at the price i got

the kindle paper white is the perfect gift for anyone my mom had the original kindle and it recently broke when i wa looking for a new one for her i looked at other kindles and e book reader i wa not a fan of the nook and the kindle fire is great but she wanted something simple just to read so she didnneed the internet connection after playing with the paper white in the store i decided it wa perfect for her she is not the best with technology but after i showed her how to use it once she wa able to use it on her own great gift for anyone
one of the best product to have save so much money on the long run i use this instead of having cable and it work even better it is half the st of one monthly cable bill and i have access to x more channel you will need one amazon tv box per tv unless you do not mind moving it from the living room to the bedroom

i got this tablet for my year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it and wa not too impressed with it i had to wait about week for the wifi to be setup at home and found out it wa way too reliant on the internet for most thing to work after inserting the sd card from her other tablet i wa hoping it d be easy to view video picture and music and had such a hard time figuring it out it took a long time for the video and picture to show up because i wa not connected to wifi and it didnregnize any music file once i did connect it it wa annoying to see that ad were displayed on the lock screen overall it is a good tablet but i just didnlike all the apps that are installed and rely on amazon is paid service
there are not many question you can inquire of alexa and not get an answer you do have to precise in the wording of your question and you always have to start with alexa decent speaker and you can do prime music the beginning of ai
i purchased this for my wife to read book on she enjoys it
i bought this for my dad and he absolutely love it
lightweight and nvenient to use love my new kindle
bought this for my year old daughter to use with our homeschool it is just the right size for her to carry around big enough to see video well but not so big that it is difficult to deal with we love it
my grandkids play with this tablet all the time lot of video and game
echo puck better deal when you add some cheap stereo speaker other than that they do the same thing and the puck over a cheaper
bought this tablet for my step daughter for christmas and she love it so much i asked for one for myself
i currently own an amazon fire kindle my kid love this one it is the perfect size for them
bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she love it great music player with all the great alexa capability opted for the tap because i m a bit weary of the echo always listening
i habe the echo and i bought this one fort my son is room but it is not a user friendly i wish i would have just bought the other one
my daughter just love her new kindle it is so easy for her to use and there is plenty of free apps for her to play with to stay out of brother hair

this is my st kindle bough for my wife later on bought another one for myself we both love it most important it wont hurt our eye and battery last for week without charging it

the amazon echo is a great product the only problem i have is if you connect it to your tv a a bluetooth speaker it will randomly stop all sound and will only resume if you say alexa pause and then say alexa play
i use this everyday for multiple purpose everyone should have one
i would remmend anyone buy this product just awesome
even if your home sinhooked up with all the technology to go with it it will still be the best speaker you ever bought and if you have amazon prime you can hook her up to it love it but be careful cause once you get it you probably wonbe able to go back to other wireless speaker again
it doe almost all the thing the more expensive kindles do for a lot le screen resolution is decent and it is a nice e reader
my friend kid loved them perfect for kid and up would def remmend

wa a great buy for my mom would remmend to anyone who read a lot of paper back
the fire tv is a good device with a powerful processor and the best playstation vue interface however it can be frustrating to access the channel you have added a you have to either search for the channel or thumb through them all one by one the roku allows you to arrange your channel in whatever order you choose the roku ha the most channel option including vudu a channel not available on the fire tv still if you intend to use the playstation vue service you ll be much happier with the fire tv
still learning how to use this tablet would have liked a little more direction on how to use it didnseem to have any paper direction included like using this tablet especially to read book email and facebook
sound quality is way better i would remmend this product to someone that is going to use it to listen to music i also have echo dot and those work nice too but alexa seems more reliable
we searched for month wanting to cut our cable bill bought the amazon fire tv box amazon ha their own programming and is adding more all the time also downloaded a bunch of apps and have been watching ted talk non stop also bought an hd antenna for local channel of which we get about deprogrammed the foreign language shopping preacher and still left with about which offer the main broadcaster and a lot of isrepeats

i originally purchased the amazon fire stick which i did not like at all it wa very slow and it didnstream netflix well i returned the fire stick in exchange for the amazon fire tv and holy w what a difference everything stream so quickly and it work tremendously well with wi fi only bad thing is you have to restart it from time to time to refresh the system

the kindle fire hd th generation is wonderful my old old old one wa the screen which wa fine but the is even nicer it still fit easily in my purse to take along with me it is great having the camera which take nice pic i have not tried the alexa feature yet so cannot say much about that the blue shade feature is wonderful for night time reading in bed with my old one even on the lowest setting it would still disturb my husband sometimes the blue shade provides a soft gentle lor that is easy to read and easy on your eye using the internet is much quicker and smoother on this version a well it is just better suited to it than my older version wa my only mplaint is that the choice for case are much more limited than case for the older version after lot of searching i found one on amazon that i really like but didnhave much choice in design lors overall i love my kindle

this is a nice item to get especially when your husband is a movie buff it will allow you to go to extended channel in order to watch whatever taste you may have for watching tv it allows you watch all kind of sport from soccer to football to baseball to lacrosse to whatever interest you

had put this off thinking my ipad would suffice but it wa hard on my eye the paperwhite is easy to download much lighter to hold while reading mpact enough to carry in my purse when i have some downtime for reading and emits a much kinder light for reading at night just what this book lover needed
i purchased this tablet on a disunted price a an alternative for rc tablet the operating system is not good very slow response apps take a lot of time to open many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire o so my little one ha a difficult time handling it after month i got him rc tablet
the tablet is okay i mean it doe the job however the wifi is really spotty we even changed the wifi password based on a youtube video to ensure that it work but it keep going in and out
excellent quality and size for my yera old daughterworks great satisfied
navigation need more work no pointer feature suck definitely not a point and click systemes explore for web browsing is antiquated and need replacedvoice alexa feature doe not work inside apps to ntrol the app so careful what you say or needle purchase are madeno disable option for voice featurestill one of the cheapest way to run kodi program direct to telly in hdmi tho one can still load app for plex server for na playback via streaming though it is extremely difficult to navigate the plex download page in e explore it faster than old version ha bluetooth instead of ha a quad re instead of dual re processor and doe not seem to get hot after hour of play like old version did but if amazon ever blocked third party apps like kodi and plex i would never buy an amazon product again tho not an amazon prime member and never will be why pay for programming that i can get for free
i am enjoying taking the kindle with me when i am traveling and also just resting in bed before falling asleep
for dollar it a great option although it wa a black friday special it perfect for kid especially nsidering the amount of damage it can handle
my kid love this tablet good for those long road trip

i wa nfused between amazon fire and kindle when buying this a both were in the same price range but i would say that i made the right choice by picking the specialized kindle reader this is the closest experience to actual book reading and sometimes even more nvenient would definitely remmend

i bought this after hearing the sound quality of the speaker at my friend house i also wanted something voice activated in the kitchen to keep handsfree the sound quality is good the noise cancelling mics are great at moderate volume only downside is no battery operation it must always be plugged in also even though it ha bluetooth and can be paired to a smartphone you cannot use the echo to pa through phone call only music for iot toy it fun for voice ntrol ex nest etc the skill are mostly cheesy though fun toy that allows easy access to prime music pandora etc
this box is the best great apps memory is powerful better than apple tv
some apps like youtube will have trouble when on wifi network all other game work perfectly fine perfectly aimed at teenager and younger
i had been researching way to forego using cable television in the future and it seems this wa good start have not quite figured it all out yet but so far so good
i m using this instead of paying for a monthly satellite bill it is worth it
good buy
easy setup work great music news sport informationtimers alarm
it is no ipad but for the price it cannot be beat mostly use a e reader and the screen is excellent and perfect size for on the go
this is the little tablet that uld the price is a steal and the speed and function deliver not a great camera but functional not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain
the fire tablet is user friendly a good size and offer many feature the display quality is good and i have no mplaints with the camera using amazon for shopping or for feature associated with prime is very easy the only issue i have had with this tablet are that my headphone jack doe not provide good sound quality and there are third party apps that are not mpatible with fire o i m hoping the app issue will be fixed by developer over time
this thing is much better than the fire stick version it is much more powerful and faster and the best part is you can connect it to the internet via ethernet cable
i love these amazon product i have so many amazon product at home i refer everyone get one
the fire stick is easy to use and set up i wish it were easier to search for movie and show
i live on my fire tablet and love this one great graphic and speed
highly remmend even my year old love it she like hearing song i have taught her
this is one of the best box out there in the market i purchase many different box but this is far suppirior quality then others good value for the money only mplain about price should be more mpitetive otherwise you will not be disappointed
i needed a good tablet for my niece and my nephew
i love the amazon echo it ha great sound for playing music and i use it every day
i gave this fire tablet five star because of the price and quality you wonfind another for the price with so many good feature i purchased it primarily for reading book from amazon and my library the screen is excellent this tablet can enlarge the size for best reading mfort the sound is very good and it is best when connecting to a set of speaker there is an advertisement when first logging on which is not too annoying to pay to remove it is great for beginner and anyone who want a light mpact tablet to carry around i also have a samsung but this wa difficult and heavy to hold while reading i also purchased a case to protect the fire it make holding the tablet easier i cannot say enough good thing about this tablet the screen sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good these were most important to me i highly remmend the amazon fire tablet
well worth the money if you have an amazon prime acunt easy set up excellent streaming quality my only mplaint is that i wish the speech search feature there is a speech regnition search feature worked with other apps
faster than firestick and also ha a micro sd slot plus usb
very happy with this kindle i purchased this kindle over the paperwhite due to the physical button
this is a great product and i love listening to music on it the sound is very good and when i want to listen to just one person i can it play that artist ntinually
i bought this for my yr old child for christmas she u it to download and read book save lot of space on the book shelf and she browse the internet and watch amazon prime movie so far it ha been a great device and for the price it ha been an amazing deal

liked this kindle upgrade the lor screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
gave it a a gift and they loved it it is perfect for anyone
pro what an ultra hd clarity it is just awesome very easy interaction to navigate earlier i have used roku but after amazon fire tv stand mile ahead of roku in many positive way n you cannot use voice remote in many apps very few option to use voice search wifi signal receiver is very poor initially i used this on wi fi and at that time it will keep on buffering and clarity wa very poor i contacted with amazon and raised a defect and got new one again same issue happened then i used it over ethernet port and then i realized the problem is with the wi fi receiving capacity of this device i placed my laptop near to my amazon device and took speed test it showed mbps even then clarity wa very poor over wi fi hence i would remmend to use this over ethernet connection
this product worked excellent right out of the box setup wa very easy and a no brainer i am totally pleased with this product and yes i would remmend it to my friend
i bought this not really knowing any amazon product and i gotta say it ha beme one of my top gadget it is aweomse i have made my sister get one too
i purchased it because my friend utilize a program that allows me to stream everything for free on the firestick i wanted to see if the connection would be better and so far it ha been awesome i also had him install a lot of old game like mario kart donkey kong centierpede overall i m just happy with my purchase
this fire is so much better than my old kindle fire hd that i now wonder why i waited so long to upgrade the display is awesome and the speed is very good all the amazon apps from my old kindle were immediately loaded onto my new one and adding the others through the kindle app store wa quick and easy
this is way better than the amazon fire stick i would remmend in any day over it
this on is much better than the original kindle fire it is replacing
i love my new echo i can play music for myself and for my grandkids a well a my wife and we all love it we all can ask question and get answer instantly
great affordable device but doe not have allow for android market app downloads and is basically good for simple browsing and game
we purchased this after wanting to get rid of satellite tv and save money we wanted to try playstation vue and needed an option for another tv this ha even a great addition and we love it very good interface and we do not miss satellite at all we have been enjoying many of the free game a well this is a great choice
i wa really surprised at how much you can do with fire tv thank you
my wife initially talked me into this i love it shopping list task music news stock market and on and on well worth it and you have someone that talk to you only when spoken to that is worth more than you can imagine highly remmend it
a bargain for the price especially for the verage of the warranty a gift for my year old granddaughter thing can happen to it she absolutely love it and pretty easy to use
much more memory that my prior kindles luv that i can add a sd card for extra storage
the screen quality is excellent and while not all android apps are available for the fire a vast number are the batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that i use is wonderful my number one negative is it is ntinued use of the old industry standard usb rd and socket for charging my wife often u the tablet while it is plugged in which lead to damage to the socket and the connector this intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device i m hoping that the new standard usb c will fix this problem in the future for now do not use the tablet or any tablet while it is plugged in
one of the best product i have purchased great sound
doe exactly what i wa hoping for amazing toy and everyone should get one
i just love this toy with time she will get better
if you like to read book i totally remmend this product i love reading book and the kindle paperwhite really help i used to read book on the ipad all the time but it would strain my eye after reading all the review i decided it wa finally time to get a ereader since i had my ipad already i just needed one to strictly read book so i got the paperwhite it is so nice to read from especially in the sun it is almost like reading from the actual book it is the perfect size to read in one hand and store so many book even some for my child it is also great for traveling i have all my book on hand no matter where i go there are only two n to the paperwhite one is that the touch screen is not that receptive a mpared to an ipad at time it doe not register my swipe or tap the other n is that it is only black and white it really is not a problem when i m reading just for the child is book
if adding more than one child to the acunt the screen will not rotate properly for the send third or fourth child geek squad uld not fix this problem seems to be a manufacturer is issue also there are too many add i returned this product
perfect tablet not only for experienced user but those that are not that tech savvy my mother in law is really enjoying the ease of use of this tablet it wa a birthday gift the quality of the build feel top notch i need to get one of these to replace my aging tablet and utilize my prime membership to it is potential
so i have bought every generation of kindle since they came out and they have all been fantastic especially for read school book
i bought this fire for my son for primarily reading definitely not a good a the antiglare one if i were buying again for that purpose i would upgrade to the one specifically for reading a a tablet it is a little difficult to navigate it seems very cluttered doe the job though
have this set up in the living room make sure to mute it when you re watching youtube video or stuff will start happening and you ll run out screaming which i have found can be very embarrassing
i bought this for my son for his room since he didnwant to spend the extra money for a cable box he really like this and is getting a lot of use out of it
it work great i love it i used to have a firestick and this wa an upgrade
useful for adult educational and entertaining for child fun to explore all the thing the echo can do from play easy jazz to answering why is not pluto a planet or take a note something for everyone in the house
i bought this thinking it wa needed for the echo that i purchased it wa not however if i ever want an amazon fire tv it will be ready
you need to find the rrect way to ask question or you will not get good answer otherwise i like this item
got this for my child and grandchild to give my mom she think she need an electronic device like all the kid have so this wa perfect she can play game and have email and the kid help her with book and video perfect for grandma
this device ha been designed taking into acunt performance in the past i used smarttvs to see online ntent such a netflix and youtube but the experience wa always bad slow response hang freeze because of low memory horrible interface and mplicated ntrols now with the amazon fire tv everything work a expected always ready no need to shutdown no need to wait just turn on the tv and you are ready to play it is fast very fast no need to wait for loading apps exiting or entering ntrols are very easy to use very responsive the multi re processor is magic also you can select from almost any streaming service you prefer netflix amazon hulu crackle etc other device offer le streaming option is not because you need all of them but you can change your mind at any point of time and you will not be stucked with your device
easy to use very good for those that need large lettering great back light
this tablet ha great storage capacity i have downloaded all kind of child is movie and learning activity it is great
i purchased the paperwhite specifically because i want to be able to read in bright sunlight i bought this around christmas time so i have not been near a pool deck yet but i assume it will do what it is advertised a it ha a six inch screen a bit small for me but i do like it it is lightweight so you can put it in a handbag and not feel weighted down the only thing i do not like is that the screen is black and white not lor like my kindle fire that took some getting used to but i look forward to laying by the pool and reading a good book while getting some sun
okay do not like the setup i like android way better cannot download you tube it is for my six year old who ha lost d xl if he can keep this one from damage is for month he get an up grade it very small
it doe what i need it to do slight flicker when going through thing but it is a good piece to have
i bought this to replace a dropped and broken one for someone just wanting to read this is easy simple and nice
my kid love these tablet they have a very easy operating system very user friendly
the mmercials are rrect at this price you can have multiple device in your household for the price of a mparable mpetitor is tablet
i like the product but i dislike that you have to download every app i believe it should me with at least a few basic apps
work great and exactly a a tablet should awesome price at best buy keep in mind there are certain apps that are not mpatible with amazon so check it out beforehand at the store but if you can do without those apps then it perfect for anyone
easy to use sometimes doe not understand or have the information use regularly a a kitchen timer and for weather update
the product is very nice it is very useful and the battery life is great it crash every once in a while but apart from that it is an excellent product to gift to someone due to the nvenient price
i have a kindle fire that is about four year old and doe not have a camera i bought the new one primarily because it ha a camera i am not disappointed the new one not only ha a great camera but it is not a heavy a my old one also the new one is much more user friendly liked it so much i bought a send one to give a a gift a great buy
we use it every day family love it will likely purchase some extra dot for around the house integration is good even with minimal home setup that we have
i love my fire it is a little smaller than i m used to
great product an excellent alternative to the much more expensive apple tv give you the option to display k ntext netflix wich current version of apple tv doe not allows you to do i bought so that i can have the slingbox app wich you can not get with apple tv sony android tv lg o or sony playstation great product highly remmended
i wa looking from long time and good deal found on best buy

it is ol we are in the st century this the beginning of a whole era of ai technology
this is a great product the voice ntrols are great and work no matter how loud the music is playing it is almost a if everything on the internet is at your finger tip ready to be accessed
wanted a tablet that wa cheap in price but good in quality this is it play the game they enjoy e book you name it parent ntrols are great you can limit the time they have on different field ha help my kid with time management they know a few minute here and there can add up quick or let them play later
ease of use and setup it would be nice if it wa out of the box easier to view your own ntent
it work a advertised great for llege student
i am someone who swears by apple product so i am skeptical when it me to other name i decided to get my son a extra tablet to use for kindle apps i can say i love this tablet great apps that are totally free awesome battery life and sound is spectacular buy this tablet you cannot go wrong going to purchase another one
a nice high quality tablet with a fast processor superb image quality long battery life and a great value equal quality and performance of an ipad at a fraction of the st
i have used this for a while now and what can i say just love it and worth buying
i purchased this a alight weight replacement for my laptop it ha acmplished everything i needed i m sure there will be something is i still need hp for but this is a great tablet for what i needed i got a case and gig card also everything work seamlessly so far
pretty easy to figure out lot of different option so many ol apps
i love that this guy support k ntent since i just recently bought a k tv please be aware that if you do not already have an amazon acunt you ll have to set one up before using it you can set it up through the fire tv but it d be best if you just do it through a mputer because the process to set up the acunt through the device i tedious and frustrating at time
this is a nice and inexpensive tablet great for reading on or looking up info on the internet only downfall is you cannot download some online game onto it
so i bought my little guy these tablet so that i uld repossess my ipad love the free time app but who uld have imagined they would not play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still do not have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous time they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they do not work again the fix take several minute a it is force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous time before it work if it work at all
got it for my future mother in law a a christmas gift she is enjoying being able to read book online
it allows me to read without using space in my phone
it wa for a gift and it ha been really liked by the receiver
good tablet for kid only down side is the youtube for kid app is not available for the kindle fire
got this for my grandma after i bought one now she love it
very parent friendly extremely thorough parental ntrols we were told at the store there wa no way to block internet or ntrol other ntent on a tablet so we decided not to get one then we read about the integrated parental ntrols with the fire and gave it a try it allowed u to do everything we wanted and more also very easy set up and use
i had no trouble registering this kindle fire i have a plane kindle i like the fire a lot better it is user friendly even for first time user
bought it for my yr old grand daughter and she absolutely love it the kidzobe package is the best
this fire tv load ntent quicker and without hesitation mpared to it predecessor love the micro sd slot to offload game to to save space
good product can add apps to it sister loved it
i like that i can sync my email and now actually use the prime streaming video service yes i know i uld use the app on my ipad but like i said i like it all packaged neatly here
the whole family is using it music bluetooth speaker question game time sport sres love the portability
the tablet ha been used for netflix a lot i am an amazon prime member on a trial basis so the u for the tablet are numerous
it is all but perfection it is a library in the hand inside or out it read equally a beautiful in either environment i only penalize it for it lack of allowing book bought outside amazon esystem to be included in freetime freetime is advertised a for kid but i like the idea of knowing how much time i have spent reading and the other offering of freetime
i m a little challenged when it me to stuff like this but it is many function make it fun to learn new thing
this is the send one i purchased this one is for our send home we enjoyed the first one we purchased for a primary home
great for streaming and learning game for kid good research tool for older kid
it is a great kindle for the price eye do not get tired from reading it
cheap tablet bought a a secret santa gift exchange item my usin opened it on christmas and absoluitely loved it simple and easy to use not a fast a an ipad but still serf in purpose for simple web browsing
like talking to a human can find an answer for most subject a long a the internet is available fairly accurate also
the whispersync technology that allows a child to read a book and listen to the audio book while it highlight the word is an indispensable tool for young reader
the echo cannot natively ntrol my tv and the intermediate fix for this do not work well either the google home ha similar shortmings but more base when playing music which i prefer other than that it really is pretty great
got this for the kid for xmas wa the best gift
i bought this a a gift for a friend with a small child the low st of the tablet and general sturdiness of it made it ideal for her little one to play with and be entertained with the child is apps good tablet for day to day use
i absolutely love my amazon echo the echo ha so many feature it really is like having a personal assistant you can get music news book and more on demand the echo is easy to link to any acunts and easy to link up with any home device mpatabile with the echo the sound quality is great and the range is excellent a well highly remmend
have had other product similar for the kid but this is the best by far best buy had a great price too so decided to try it love it
i like set the font on large so i can read without my reading glass i can read at night without turning on the light
much better than i expected for such a great price
just wish i uld remove most of the amazon apps other then that it is good for the kid
got this for my year old granddaughter and she love it u it for game play homework etc mom and dad love the parental ntrols not having to worry so much
easy to nfigure work a expected easy to download book
a expected i would suggest to get a ver the dictionary is very easy to use
it is a great tablet for my kid at their age i remmend it to anybody looking for one
love it great speaker a long a u have access to wifi
really pleased with voice regnition and the different apps that work with it google home doe a bit of a better job when it me to search query however
well worth the money it is just a pretty well thought out tablet the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease it is also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun good looking game which is pretty amazing at this price point
bought for christmas one for a year old and one for a year old it work well for them and if they trash it i m only out for a replacement
excellent price function well added memory card for additional storage wonderful purchase for use a both reader and tablet
my son love to play it
the screen on this tablet is very nice good picture
met all my expectation lightweight and mpact i enjoy using the product
my friend tell me to buy this and i wa a little curious and it is a great box for the tv
i would remmend this product to all my friend and family
this is great i wa used to just the plain kindle and this feel more like a tablet than just a kindle i use it to check email do pintrest and read my book totally in love with my new kindle fire
so far so good i m quite pleased with the purchase i had an early version of kindle pre touch screen and i didnanticipate that added feature would make that much difference but it is so nice i still like hard py book but reading on the kindle fire is quite enjoyable
i bought this after my kindle keyboard died i like having a dedicated reader it easier on my eye it light weight and fit in my purse with the ver on it the ad do not bother me great purchase
friendly user systen easy to setup good size to put in a bag
i like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice you can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say alexa
it would not connect with any of my smart home item it would not understand some mmands
i absolutely love the kindle paperwhite the battery life is great reading a half hour to an hour a day it last week screen backlight is very easy on the eye and adjustable in brightness this is one of my best tech purchase
good product with good feature like the suggestion book in email
i love this product my wife wa not too happy at first because i placed in our bedroom now she love it a she can listen to music when she is putting on her make up in the morning
first of all you cant beat the price i got it for my yr old granddaughter and it serf it purpose well it perfect for her to play game on or watch you tube vidios it size make it easy to take it with u almost everywhere because it fit rite in my purse
i purchased and all were successful gift thank you
so far we use it for entertainment and it ha not disappointed we have found every genre of music and many obscure musician with it have some privacy ncerns but overall for music and joke it is fun my wife ha disvered new song due to an occasional misinterpretation but always fun enjoy great for waking u up also
this is a great little tablet it is wonderful for reading going online and using apps the only reason i gave it four star wa because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet other then that you re definitely getting the most bang for your buck the price just cannot be beat
and it hold a lot of data plus you can add more storage been using it a lot
i love diz one cheap best price last year purchase this product
bought these for my son and they love them lot of ol feature
up until now i had been using different android box to stream movie i had read that the fire tv is very quick and capable of k which is better than the expensive apple tv super easy to set up and boot lightening fast easy to sideload apps such a kodi i bought one for myself and another for my daughter we all love it the remote ntrol is very responsive and voice search is awesome
excellent gadget a little tricky in the beginning to setup the mmands but once you got it everything go well
great item work perfect and great protection exactly what i needed
my grandson u this just about every night it wa a great purchase and we re glad we made it
alexa is tall slim and attractive but too jealous to use google and that make her rather dumb and she is just a shill for amazon prime dropping the personification music volume change annoyingly with different song and over time the database amazon echo draw from is very limited alexa cannotell you what the weather is but not what the most mmon woman is shoe size is what serena williams age is but not how many gun ruger sold last year stand by for more tech savvy mpanies to take the echo ncept to maturity
bought this for my daughter yr and ended up getting a send one for my son i do wish best buy sold the kid proof case but meh the tablet is quick the memory is expandable a well which is what keep me from anything iwhatever throw a gb card in this and your kid can make video on musical ly all dang day and beme a youtube sensation still waiting on that check parental note if you go this route take advantage of amazon is freetime it is fantastic customizable safe and easy to stay hand off i use it with both tablet with both kid time limit no questionable ntent depending on what you call questionable i hate kidzbop and excellent apps etc included tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting too so if you despise kid you can still enjoy your lonely hollow selfish existence with this outstanding tablet
bought it for my wife and the fire doe not have to be recharged a often a the paper white she like it
we liked this product a lot web surfing and skype is great
the kindle fire hd ha a larger screen v and image are crisper with more vibrant lors
the kindle voyage is better than the real thing after wearing out a first generation kindle in our home we knew we wanted something with versatility of the original with a few added feature the background light is a big plus a it allows my wife to read at night without having to keep the light on it is a great ereader at the right price
i love the echo is ease of checking the weather and traffic in the morning by simply speaking a question not having to browse channel on the tv or site on the internet save me time and get me out the door much quicker each day
i love this solution for my kid i gave it a four star rating because in order to install apps you just have to tap the in well my two year old and five year old went tap crazy like a kangaroo on a pogo stick needle to say the ran out of room quickly i tried to teach them to not launch apps that were notinstalled but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what is not aside from this it is a fantastic device for kid to play and learn with i especially like the parental ntrol feature i just wish they would put in a feature for ntrolling what get installed
good tablet for traveling and reading on the road
bought this for my year old since he broke his portable dvd player the only think i do not like is i had to sneakily download the google app store so i uld install vudu on it
these are better for kid instead of those fancy and stly kid tablet if you set these up with right ntent they need resolution is not great though you get what you pay for
it is not free everything have to pay and had return it to best buy store wish free everything without cent sorry
i wa looking for something new to use to read with and this wa a good choice easy to navigate multi functional and great lor
i have tried to get it work still cannot get it to work
nice size good processor speed not happy that i cannot gety google music
this our send paper white my husband love the lighting on it
i bought of these on black friday and these have to be one of the worst buy of my life the screen saver cannot be changed so my kid are forced to look at ad every time they want to use their tablet apps are ok and to be honest i uld have dealt with the ad but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card i bought my kid sd card so they can have more than game and the tablet doe not read it or something it say sd card inserted but it wondownload apps to the sd card
bought for my wife to upgrade from the original kindle that she ha worn out big step up from the original and should be good for another year
easy to use reliable interface possible house hold money saver if properly moded lol
the kindle wa great but too small for my vision impaired mother it wa a gift
this is a good tablet for someone who want a starter nice screen easy to use great graphic
this device is a classic reader for people also a good gift for student it is very mfortable to use it
i will be buying these everyone i know fantastic price too
way better than fire stick i needed more word and had nothing more to say
having an only child this is his new best friend they talk for hour back and forth all joking aside the echo is awesome i have the dot and the show a well and they are all great
i bought the kindle at a very nice price and everything work well i like it
i purchased the fire tv box over the fire stick because the box support k video there is not a lot out there yet but i have been able to watch k programming from netflix and amazon prime i m using the netflix hulu and fxnow apps amazon prime is built in i also downloaded the free vlc app to stream video from my mputer i may end up getting a send one for another tv very happy with the fire box
okay so i have been debating for day on whether to rate this thing or star and i still want to rate it and a half but i have settled for star here is why prosthe only real reason i wanted this case over the others is because every other case hold the kindle in with strap around the edge and this is the only case that hold the kindle in while letting you see the whole front side it hold it in perfectly neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out the black leather is genuine leather and smell nice and while the front ver is very thin if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound and it can be bent without much effort it take mild amount of abuse without a problem also the flap fold back perfectly and when you are reading you hardly notice the kindle ha a case on nsmy main mplaint is the quality of the leather if you mpare this to the case for the kindle keyboard the leather is a little thinner but much le durable i sometimes lightly hold my kindle between my teeth when i run out of hand and after a week i can still see my tooth mark whereas on the k case i uld not also even a mild scratch will either take several day to disappear update most scratch will mostly disappear so it not a big a problem a i originally thought the only other mplaint is of urse the lack of anything to hold the ver closed but this ha actually not been much of a problem for me quite often i like to frisbee toss my kindle onto a nearby soft surface like carpet or a pillow or bed and i wa afraid the ver would flap open every time but time out of the i tried it stayed shut just fine read more
i love this item because i just love all electronics
bought for a birthday gift they loved it we found ourselves playing with it for hour alexa what is
i bought this tablet for my wife she like the size for reading book and for reading info on the web the tablet is size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around it also ha to be charged often and that is not even nsidering time reading book hard to find a case for this latest kindle
i really love the tablet i brought it for my younger kid
i lurve reading just lurve it and i lurve my kindle
not a lot of ink but decent bang for the buck do not be fooled by the original price it is always cheaper
great price kid love it lot of space for apps
i love the fact that i can have it play all type of music the alexa also help with amazon shopping and current event
easy to setup and use even without peripheral the syste interaction wa beneficial
good tablet easy to use for yr not a many free stuff a expected have to pay for most game movie and book
love it very good idem front and rear camera let you capture memorable moment with friend and family
amazing resolution is a great diference with the firestick
i gave it to my friend is kid they love it quite good for the proce
the whole ai question and answer dynamic is ol but the speaker are weak the bass is non existent and the treble is harsh
i purchased this to upgrade from my old kindle a it wa not connecting to the internet quick enough i am happy with the connection and speed of this product
i wa not told i had to belong to amazon uld not get it to work with my router i had been wanting this tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it i am heart sick to have to return it at one time working with the a general manager by the name of brenda on my problem she wa highly disrespectful embarrassing to me i front of other customer and very rude representing best buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into acunt i would fire her in a heart beat i understand from other employee she is like this quite often if you cannot fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she ha to deal with the public and putting her behind the scene would benefit best buy more than you know thank you
we already own one of these purchased another for my mom we all love it connects easily to the echo and all other apps we normally use
but fast forwarding through ntent can reset the cursor and put you at the beginning of the ntent and occasionally can get you out of the application perhaps additional memory in a future version of this product may fix this however watching subscription free ntent is always a treat good solid product i also own roku and it interface slightly easier for elderly and those with not much patience
my original kindle wa no longer working it wa year old and had been used a lot i especially like the smaller size of my new kindle and the backlight
i got this for my daughter and we re both happy with the quality
place amazon order use reminder timer music love it
i used the echo for on demand music news weather and general information this is a simply one of the most piece of electronics i have ever bought

i bought this for my grandson for christmas present and he love it he is on it all the time it also teach him to read and a lot of other thing he ha game on it and he would be on it hour a day if we would let him
i found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen
the amazon echo is worth it just for playing music you can play pandora or amazon prime music but it is much more from setting a timer to adding item to my shopping list alexa answer your question better than any device and totally hand free
this is my first android tablet i have used numerous apple ipad is though the only thing i have been dissatisfied with is that there is not an instagram app available but that doe not have anything to do with amazon or kindle

not yet sure all it can do but love that i can just ask for the weather or ask it to play music by a particular artist fun to work with
logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown even temporarily so inadvertent typo require guesswork to find signing out of e mail is not clear if it can be done some free downloads fail because of lack of payment allowing for my lack of skill i wa hoping for a little more it wa ok fort basic stuff

this is the best rd cutter streaming box on the market i have owned roku apple tv and chromecast and this is by far the best offer great performance the remote is very user friendly and i think it ha a better selection of apps the interface is laid out nicely but feel a little mpact with a lot of stuff on the screen all at once
good tablet so far my kid have really enjoyed it and have not put down since they got it
purchased a a replacement for an older kindle and the fire hd did not disappoint the intended recipient wa thrilled that a camera came with it well worth the money

we bought this for the son of a family friend from what we cannotell they like it not the highest resolution screen and you have to be tied to amazon service to really enjoy it but it is definitely a nice functioning tablet

this is a great speaker and easy to use it is really user friendly
wa very pleased with this product glad it worked out and provides flexibility for use
overall this is a far cry from the more popular ipad and is nowhere near a intuitive or easy to use but a a le expensive option for my child to learn on it is the perfect fit the price point is perfect for first time tablet user though you will surely need to invest in a memory card to expand the storage capacity

the kindle voyage is the best e reader experience available text is super sharp it is mfortable to hold the built in self adjusting light is awesome and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel unfortunately all those great feature me at a price that is more than amazon is kindle paperwhite and more than double the st of the mpany is entry level reader both of which are excellent in their own right so five star for the device itself and minus one star for the high price
amazon make an amazing product that turn any tv into a smart tv slim sleek and extremely easy to install and use

great tablet if your looking for something easy to set up and use
i have tried the google home and the simple ok google is a syllable too long for ease voice ntrol use the echo simply ha so many mpatible device even separate from my smartthings hub that it can ntrol the soubd it delivers is sufficient for standalone use but option to connect to speaker via bluetooth or aux is useful it can hear you much better than the google home and the integration with other echo dot in a smart home make the experience seamless setup is a breeze my only gripe is that mmands need to be exact to your setup so you just cannot say turn off all light without a trigger made up unlike google home overall it is a great product for home automation and voice ntrol
this kindle replaces a previous model the size is great fit easily into purse or gym bag the touch screen is a nice improvement over my earlier model the backlit screen is good bright enough but not too bright overall i am very pleased
the kindle essentially give you a library in your hand you can read for hour on charge

alexa ha been a wonderful resource for our family most any question asked or any remmendations review requested have been spot on we have not used her to order anything yet but may do that in the future we did learn that you have to ensure there is nothing blocking the speaker that you speak very clearly in order to receive an answer

i have to say i have enjoyed this over many droid box and i think it is easier to use it ha gotten locked up a few time and i had to unplug it to have it do a hard restart other then that i have to say for the price it is a good product
this is a good value but i purchased a kindle fire black friday of and i have to say it ha more feature and now i am spoiled it is a gb storage also i want another one like it in case mine ever quits
it is a good tab for the kid keep them busy wish the speed wa faster
i have had a kindle since they first came out this is my th one and they just keep getting better read great in daylight night time whenever
the kindle fire is such a great tablet with alot of different apps and so easy to use
perfect gift perfect price for my wife to bring her into the technilogical modern world we live in
screen camera and processor do not perform too well but for the price you pay it is definitely a bargain
for a pre teen this is what exactly my niece needed it replaced an old ipad for her it doe almost everything the ipad did and the price wa a lot better
awesome for the price perfect for little one if you do not want to worry about them cracking the screen or dropping the product and paying a lot of money
doe all they claim am really enjoying my new kindle
i have enjoyed using kindles for about year now this particular one wa purchased a a gift for another kindle user and after looking at the one my mom ha thought this would be the perfect gift for my friend who is an avid reader and the black friday sale price wa unbeatable
i enjoy reading with my kindle fire that is the reason i purchased it because i do not have wi fi my use is limited
bought for friend anniversary they love it the first one wa damaged no hassle return
i had one it wa a gift when it broke down i wanted another one so i bought this one
great device to use when you want to work on small thing that doe not require a mputer it is portable and is capable of streaming with out problem battery life seems to go quickly but real quick to recharge
it is fun to use requesting music asking for sport update asking for weather forecast shopping list much more not even tried yet
bought this for my daughter for her birthday and linked it to my amazon prime acunt so she can get free book music and movie she love it
i always buy these kindles for rporate giveaway they re reasonably priced and are great quality
great for my daughter and my mom they love it
i purchased the kindle fire about three week ago and rarely pick up my ipad anymore it is a great reading device with the flexibility of allowing you to access many other basic application i carry it with me practically all the time
great tablet for my and year old is it is very easy for them to use with the free time mode i love amazon and love that i can switch between different user profile no matter which tablet i m using definitely remmend to others with child only downfall is some of the apps i use that are on either googleplay and itunes are not available in the amazon appstore and it doe not have bluetooth but overall it is excellent for my child and the price wa amazing
great value for the price recipient is enjoying it very much
i love the kindle paperwhite but it doe not accept any of my game
i think this is the best table for reading book and just browsing the net
until i buy all the light and linked product this is just a radio with limited station
great e reader ha an awesome battery life great for traveling or hanging at home so awesome to have thousand of book available to you i feel like book price on ereaders have been rising and that is unfortunate i have two at home and i love them though
i use to ntrol my smart device in the home and listen to music my kid also use to help them with their home work
bought for each of our teenager and they just love it very ol reading feature and zero buffering while watching netflix
so far i have bought three of these of tablet and they love it
worked a expected
very slow to connect to internet even with a good connection and wifi set up that worked for other electronics
k capability ethernet direct hook up to router for faster streaming voice remote ntrol much better and not so restricted like apple tv a
i had an old ipad and when it quit i decided to go for the amazon fire tablet really only used it to play game and for entertainment i hate it battery life is very short i pretty much need to keep it plugged in at all time and it freeze and just shuts out of screen i cannot take it anymore and am now going to buy another ipad do not waste your money on this i am very unimpressed with this product and amazon in general now
the amazon fire is a great way to watch movie tv show and sport i connect directly to my router in my opinion work a lot better than wi fi
i m loving my kindle early gift to myself happy
bought for my grandson he love playing with it and enjoys the video
great in sunlight long battery life very happy with purchase
i have owned firesticks in the past but the speed on the fire tv box is definitely much faster very happy
it took me a little time to get used to thinking of asking alexa but now it me easily
i travel extensively for work and recently had stopped carrying book to cut down on bulk in my carry ons a sale pushed me into finally buying a kindle and it ha been a great purchase for me the screen is extremely easy to read ha almost too much granularity in brightness setting and is visible in all lighting nditions the ability to add library e book is also a huge nvenience for being able to read new book in addition to buying direct from amazon
i ordered this online on black friday i live about mile from nearest store and i saw the special on their website so why not i thought came in yesterday maybe it is just because i m not familiar with this product i m used to android tablet that have you set up with your google acunt this one you set up with your amazon acunt ok no big deal i thought at first then i found it very difficult to install the free month webroot it came with i went to google play a instructed it say installed but there is no open button to click to ntinue the process a instructed when i contacted amazon customer support i wa told i cannot use google play on it and to use the app store instead i wa given a link for webroot installation but it didnhelp i downloaded google chrome but cannot find it on the device no youtube facebook gmail apps woninstall again maybe i m just not used to the product but if i cannot use google apps on it i wonlike this it is actually for my son and even though teen are often smarter than we adult when it me to gadget lol i do not think he will like this either so i m returning this hopefully can find an android tablet i like and affordable at best buy
my amazon tv ha two gig in the ram and a quad re processor and it run great no problem right now only owned it for six week right now but it is good
echo is tough to deal with doe not understand most the question i ask you definitely cannot do a follow up question speaker sound great look great also will hook up to device for automation hopefully they update it for mm cuz google home is killing it there
work a described but still need some improvement such a more language more nvenient menu overall it is one of the best tv box in the market now
i bought this a a gift for my friend i personally own alexa and echo dot this product is excellent easy set up and easy to use i would remmend this product over google home for one alexa wa the first to me out with this and a lot of tweeks and update are posted in the email i have my kitchen light hooked up to alexa and can use by dimming out my light hope you will enjoy your alexa a well a i did mine
this is my send echo and i also have a dot decided i needed one for my office sound is great set up wa easy i would say that alexa ha gotten used to my voice because i find it is accurate and the few time that is just pop on when i didnrequest it well i go to my amazon acunt to see what it picked up usually good for a laugh one day it played a child is song the wheel on the bus go round and round you cannot go wrong with one
very nvenient
this met my expectation and more my granddaughter love it it is user friendly and ha unlimited option for her would remmend to everyone
very good picture and it even take picture which is awwsome you even get a free month of amazon prime which came in very handy around christmas time
i bought this for my wife after she started having headache from doing facebook and email on her iphone the larger screen make it easier for her to use for an extended period of time
cannot blue tooth to my speaker without slecting it from a list there is no list
we really enjoy our alexa i always have it for music lately we been movie time the kid like to ask it silly question and they cannot get enough of it
perfect product for senior citizen who just want to do a little internet shopping and receive and send email nice size screen and easy to use great gift for a lot le investment than an ipad or laptop
well it happened i became a huge fan of e book preferring them over an actual physical book this old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage never ever thought that would happen then came the kindle paperwhite i think i have read close to book this past month because of the paperwhite i can make the font larger which is great for my old eye and it is lit from the side so it doe not make my eye tired like typical lcd screen where the light shoot up at your eye because of this you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness also the battery last a very long time i usually have to charge it only after reading a full book and an added bonus is that you cannot get any apps on the paperwhite which sound like a negative but that mean there is no distraction temptation to surf the web instead of read when you open it up you are mmitted to reading it is sooooo much better than my nook which make my eye tired and is a distraction it is among the best purchase i have ever made
i love this product it is well worth the money that i paid for it
this wa a girl for my husband he love it great sound picture
this product is great and easy to use it is an all in one entertainment product
my wife and kid love it easy to use great for the price
great product and it move faster than the firesticks
i mainly purchased this tablet for my toddler i didnwant to spend too much on a tablet since she only like her one baby app it work well good image and sound cannot beat the price
i use this mainly to watch movie on amazon and netflix great addition to my household
alexa speaks clearly and give mprehensive answer to question asked of it having weather sport and news on voice demand without having to type a request is terrific
you can find thousand of movie and your favorite show
this is so much faster than the fire stick highly remmended
reasonable price yet love it my kid love itttttt
good tablet for kid basic functionality not much memory
i know it ha bluetooth but i think it should have had a auxiliary port for older speaker s
new to ebooks and researched available ereaders and tablet what i like best about the oasis is the weight lightest on the market battery life measured in week not hour and the capability to use it in bright sunlight remmend it for all
my four year old son love it you have everything for le than
work well kid love testing it and adding item to the grocery list
much faster than the stick in every way wifi processor and ram i like this a lot more than the stick it is just snappier the voice remote is useless i still prefer the apple tv over aftv
i love this tablet it is durable and my niece love it
the sound is really good for a portable speaker i have dot but use this one in the living room to listen to music
definitely worth the investment i may get a uple of more
i like it it is money well spent i will remmend it
got for my year old grandson durable plenty fast for his game no more squenting to see his phne
i did not need this
the amazon echo is one device i uld not imagine being without it is always there for music and any random question i have
watch it over over again blu ray is the best
this multifunctional device is amazing after downloading the apps your possibility are endless
for the price you cannot beat the deal on a tablet crystal clear picture and very fast ok so the wide variety of apps available on an apple or android are not here but most major apps are and if the app is not available just go to their website a simple fix
this is a very nice tablet and for the price i think is a great price performance ratio enjoying it very much so far the only n so far is that doe not me open to access google play store though there are some work arounds nice size and excelent resolution for ocasional streaming
ipad killer a fierce tablet at a nvinient price
the firetv box is a great device to help with cutting cable it ha k streaming and all the apps you need to watch movie and tv on the device or you can download them you can install side load and install android apps on this a well i would remmend one to anyone
the kindle is a great reader this work even in full sunlight
help to charge you kindle when not near a usb port
never thought a tablet at this price uld be this good totally remmended
my son wanted a tablet just for his book we looked at e reader and tablet this wa so much better and the price wa perfect
i got an window tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that window is not a good choice for someone that is not already mfortable with all the window feature that are not tablet friendly this tablet on the other hand had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became mfortable with all the feature in a uple of hour i would definitely remmend it a a gift
this is our family is th product of the same all of u have one and they are lasting forever will never be without one
kid proof bought for my grand baby and they love it
pretty good tablet for the st i would highly remmend
i have roku device and i m totally impressed by this amazon hit it out of the park
good performance for most apps however i primarily purchased it to watch p vue and although the p vue app is better than on roku it suffers from more lag and glitch than watching p vue via p or p
just what i ordered work a expectd
my vision is failing but this is easy to read in any light it fit nicely in my purse to take anywhere
too much amazon not enough google but for to surf the net is ok i guess
we purchased these for our younger kid age so they uld play game and read perfect size and they love them the only negative is that the charging port is very fragile
if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet that can keep up with everyday casual use then this tablet is a good buy
my wife might leave me for alexa thank goodness she cannot open jar
love the fire tv doe away with loading time on the fire stick
the best streaming player ever and super fast for you tube and netflix
i never thought i d like an e reader i m kind of a dinosaur i like real book the feel the smell ah but ala i travel a lot and i read even more at my age lugging around a bunch of book in my carry on wa beming le enjoyable so after my last journey i decided to try a kindle well i must say i m not going back to paper it downloads title in sends hold a mini library and fit easily in my purse i m still on my first charge the light in the display make reading in low or no light possible the screen prevents glare and the ntrols are easy enough for a techno phobe such a myself fantastic
love using my new tablet amazon fire easy to use
we use this speaker all the time it is perfect i would buy this time and time again
grandson love his new tablet had to set him up a an adult because amazon had too many restriction for child acunt
love the built in light and the screen make it easy to read outside
purchased this for my year old daughter so she uld watch cartoon on netflix it is very durable i use it sometimes myself not a powerful a an ipad mini or galaxy tab but very good for the price
just love it would not leave home with out it remmend to any read aholic
i purchase my alexia about a month ago and waited to write this review in order to get more familiar with it operation set up wa a breeze with no problem connecting to my home network at present i am using my alexia for my morning news brief while having breakfast listening to bloomberg cnn fox and reuters news brief you pretty much get an insight of whats happening in the world if you wake her up by saying alexia good morning she will give you some interesting information ncerning the day i also use her for reviewing by daily schedule and local weather before heading out no longer do i have to search in my ipad listing to music is a pleasure since the sound is very acceptable and i can change the volume or skip song without even moving she response to my voice from across the room the timer function is a help when oking and setting a alarm by voice is a great nvenience eliminating some use of my phone it would be nice to have alexia call your contact on your phone with ifttt but that would involve uploading your contact list to amazon something that at the moment i would not do my future plan is to interface alexia with a smart home system which will operate by voice ntrol i am happy with my purchase and would remmend alexia to anyone
good picture work well great variety of apps keep in mind that you get apps from amazon not google play so they are not always the same or same price
i really like the fire tv we have had one in our living room for several year and i bought this one for my wife for christmas to put in the bedroom great utility and very easy to sue
i bought this a a guft for my family for christmas and i think it ha great potential for future next gen personal assistance my aunt absolutely love it and it and she is a business owner and she u it to keep up on stock quote and knowing what her scheduled is for the rest of the day my uncle u it for sport update and more i know it new technology so i think it definitely worth the money but still can be a better ai in the future i do wish that alexa gave you time answer the question back on certain skill like knock knock joke riddle and more instead she tell you the whole joke without more interaction from the user i will say i am still pleased from everside but ill be honest i think google home doe have some ability that alexa doesnt but i am still amazon echo hand down and will be waiting for the next gen amazon echo to see where it go i also will purchase another one soon for myself
this tablet is great for a child it will stand up to accidental drop and ha just enough expandability for future use i give it star
after reading how fast this unit wa i wa highly disappointed my roku leaf the amazon fire tv in the dust it take forever to load up then freeze several time while being used
alexa ha beme part of the family and her ability to interact is awesome
bought this tablet for my daughter it wa very hard to figure out how to switch to the kid profile she used it for maybe a day and when we went to charge it the cable just fell out and would not actually charge
purchased the alexa to act a a vocal head to my smart home setup it doe this very well she will tell you the weather on mmand and play music too can also act a a bluetooth speaker
so glad i decided to purchase this i gave it a a gift and the person absolutely love it
i wa using a roku box and various game nsoles before this for netflix hulu and other streaming platform but the amazon fire tv really is the best option out there currently the device is fast and responsive includes ton of different apps and integration and best of all ha alexa support for search if you re a amazon prime member especially this device is a must have
love the echo it is amazing doe whatever i ask
bargain for the price long battery life the screen quality is good i use this tablet everyday
this tablet disappointed me from the beginning i loved my previous fire tablet however this new one disappointed me from get go i do not want it to tell me what i like or want i do not like ad that pop up i do not want suggestion for me on book movie or anything else i know what i like i definitely do not want it talking to me in this day and age with identity theft prevalent i would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on feature like location etc all in all i am ready to bust it up and throw it away
i just like reading amd playing game on it better then those bulky mputers
great item for someone who is home alone most of the time talking to it is an helper in acmplishing mplex task listening to it is pleasing in sitting still
worth getting great for the priceand very handy for movie and music
i like the kindle it is light and easy too sue battery life is good
i have an ipad mini but it is impossible to see in the sun i started thinking about getting a kindle while on vacation and trying to read a book at the pool damp hand wrinkled page sunscreen all made the experience icky i live the size battery power ease of use and you can see it outside
my wife love her fire hd she had one of the older model so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away
we bought one of these for our year old a few month ago and we liked it so much we bought one a a christmas present for a year old parent it obviously is not the highest quality tablet on the market but it very responsive and get the job done and you cannot beat the price just a great value
i wa a bit skeptical at first about purchasing this device over a roku i am so glad that i did even though i have cable tv i end up watching this device for movie and other entertainment more then cable tv everything load super fast
love it nice and clean powerful tv box fast shipping from best buy all the time
this great for catching up on facebook or going over email
my baby boy ha one i knew my girl would love it a well fun game and the appstore ha access to new game and book
got this for my kid very affordable good memory well powered star only because i did not realize the limitation of the kindle restricted android software
this is a good tool to use i however would suggest that you upgrade to the better version i did and i like it much better
bought this for my son for occasional use wa able to download google playstore which greatly expands apps availability no issue with playing game and watching movie screen quality is more than acceptable a solid performer
love echo using in bedroom my wife u it more than i and we re probably using only of alexa is ability mostly listen to music which fill the room well
love my echo i am still new to the process and am learning how to use it listening to music is a great pleasure the sound is so rich and enjoyable i look forward to learning more about it and installing echo mpatible product in my home
i purchased this kindle for a friend in fact it is the third kindle i have purchased for friend it is light and can be used at the beach or in the dark it is easy to use and worth the money
there wa a lot of proprietary stuff that take away from the actual usage of the device
very easy and dependable it fit perfect in a purse or pocket to take to work to use on break
best purchase ever love our echo highly remmend the amazon echo to anyone
i bought this device for my wife she ha been using a kindle fire i wanted something with a bigger screen for her she like it very much
not kid friendly at all purchased for little nephew wa not given any info on it for sale person either took back
great tablet for the price easy set up and app and data transferring from the original fire
it work great i had a an amazon fire stick previously the amazon fire tv responds quicker and i have not had any buffering issue thanks to a faster network interface card
the battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot it allows me to store all of music so i do not have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party
still in shock all the tablet can do for it a no brainer
i got this for on black friday it wa a great deal but the ad are kind of annoying ad go away after you turn the tablet on but it is a bit distracting at time however it is a small price to pay for such a nice tablet it is a nice little device to keep on hand for web browsing and watching netflix before bed
i just love my kindle fire but it is a little heavy to carry with me that is why i wanted to buy the kindle paperwhite it is light weight so it fit nicely in my purse or my work bag i just love the no glare i m able to read at night or outside at work on lunch break it is great glad i did buy it worth every penny
i love it good sound quality much better than amazon tap plus alexa is best
i am so glad i got this tablet i cannotake it with me anywhere and use anytime
i wa hesitant to buy the echo but waited until it wa on sale it is great for music and tie to amazon prime or bluetooth to your phone unfortunately it need to be plugged in at all time to be powered on
the fire doe a ton and sts very little i really like it
work great with kodi enough power to direct play h sd card slot is a bonus for apps and usb for external medium threw my roku away
i had an older fire and i must say thus one is definitely an upgrade speed of browser and apps opening is faster lor choice are nice
this is an excellent product remmend to everyone
work great keep a pretty good charge my sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
amazon echo is a great start to electronic personal assistant voice regnition is very accurate
this product work great and you can speak right to the remote of what you want
really enjoy using this great for adding grocery to a list or with additional equipment turning on light listening to music or the news i use this more than originally thought
wish it searched the internet like siri but over all it is super ol doe a lot and voice regnition is great
it is everything you can ask for in a tablet the only downfall wa the camera but at a price like that you get what you pay for
ntemplated getting a kindle paperwhite for several month before purchasing my kindle paperwhite is fantastic it is light weight easy to handle and worth every penny i paid for it the first thing i did wa download free book i never had the opportunity to read mainly classic book on philsophy government and leadership i love that i cannotake it with me and read to my heart is ntent made a great decision when i made this purchase
this is a great little tablet me and my brother in law bought one originally for his dad because his laptop wa getting a little old and the main thing he doe on it is watch youtube video it performs fine for what he doe it for it wa such a steal my brother in law got one himself because he wanted to play game on it and again work perfectly great buy for the price
work great thanks
i bought this for my year old i wa a great buy the price wa affordable mpared to other tablet on the market and e screen is perfect another great buy
i got a magenta lor because i loved the beautiful purple ish lor shown on the picture instead i got a really bright pink ish lor which look nothing like the lor shown here i went to the store hoping to replace it with a different lor but wa told that since i bought it on sale i had to pay the dollar price difference if i wanted to exchange unbelievable the product is good but i never liked the best buy customer service
if you are an amazon prime member it is great order through alexa ask her question and shopping list are awesome
i m on a year is assignment in la i have had amazon prime for year but now it is essential to keep track of my programming
this tablet fulfills my need at a great price love it

whether if you have cable or not we do not this is an amazing device to have many movie to choose from
only few skill were added to alexa and when my kid are asking general educational related it is not giving them right answer
i purchased two of these tablet to replace all the other brand that stopped working within a two month period so far so good it is a perfect fit for my two younger child and i feel you cannot beat the price for a fire i have ntrol on what they access the only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose when charging i have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stay in the unit
work in lot of light and very minimal light battery seems to last a long time finished an entire book maze runner and the battery indicator barely went down
this is my first streaming video device and i did a good bit of research before buying the video quality is excellent and the operator interface is easy to use
i do like the portability of my tap you do lose some feature from the echo like speaking to it from across the room but i m happy with it and it ha good sound great to take out by the pool
i would have to say this thing is so ol ntrol most of my plug in stuff like ac in the room turn it on and off with the modular
this tablet is very reasonably priced for child and i love the insurance replacement must have for the young one
i love this tablet it is great for indoor reading a well a outdoors the back lighting make it ideal for indoor space that are not well lit

my grandson loved it shipping wa lightning fast thank you
amazon is at the forefront of k ntent offering several show in hdr then why is not their very own streaming player capable of displaying it and at only fps to boot this wa obviously built to a price but if you have already shelled out the money for a k tv would not you want it to be able to display all that it is capable of the roku is at present the far superior product
we really enjoy it bought it to watch our slingbox but we have found ton of extra ntent that we really enjoy
the paperwhite is so much easier to use than the classic kindle the back light touch screen are definitely worth the upgrade
i wa originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet on a post birthday afternoon when i learned amazon wa selling a low budget version of the current kindle generation while my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modification i can say this is an excellent purchase if you re looking for a portable browser and book reader a fairly decent and accurate battery sound is low in volume but reliable expandable memory work for application so dozen of apps can be added quickly while i can personally say it is extremely durable mpared to io device a small fall against smooth stone doe not st anything but extremely fine scratch only visible in sunlight however by default you re extremely restricted by the amazon marketplace which is nowhere near a updated and expansive a google play if this uld access both store i d give it a out of
i wanted a digital something for store my book on i m am an avid reader when time permit but i hate toting around my book losing my bookmark is irritating with my new paperwhite i never have that problem and i can even carry around more than one book i absolutely love my kindle paperwhite

we got this for my son foe christmas love it and keep him entertained it is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it me with the only fault i see with this is in kid acunt before you load anything on to it there are already ton of apps available to download a you please i wish there wa a way to have just the apps you choose to show up i do also wish that there wa a way to lock the screen or app that he is playing at the time so little finger do not get off the app accidently he is only almost though so i cant mplain too much other than those two thing my son love it
good tablet for adult it is great when installing xbmc kodi and stream vidoes online

so my month old maybe the future mputer wizard because she everything about my tablet however my biggest ncern is not so much that she know how to unlock my ipad but throwing it down the stair like one of her toy which make the kindle fire tablet for kid the best invention since the tivo all the pre loaded apps video book etc is nothing short of amazing the case is also very ol hardwood floor and stair case proof for under buck this is perfect for tech savvy kid like mine
the echo ha simplified so many thing turning on the light checking the weather playing music i d hate to think about what life wa like before
awesome tablet for kid they love it would remmend it to anyone

my year old daughter love this tablet i witnessed her drop it once off the uch to laminate floor nothing i cannotell wa affected i wa a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child but with the way we seem to rely on technology these day plus the st i just had to buy it my favorite feature is the parental ntrols that allow me to set time not just time that it can be used but for certain ntent a well i can set the tablet so when my older kid and log in they need to mplete educational task for an allotted amount of time before free play and the whole thing log out after a certain time so i do not have to go searching for it in their room at night great tablet glad i got the bumper too great price
excellent graphic quality easy to use doe not use infra red so other remote will not work with it

because the amazon fire is a very inexpensive tablet you cant really expect much out of it or mpare it to an ipad it is a great budget tablet for very light gaming and watching video my primary use for it is for video nsumption
this wa purchased a a gift for an avid reader and a a streaming medium device i looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right mpromise between size and portability for the planned u
well worth the money

ha a faster processor than the firestick and ha the ability for expandable memory work great
ok it not an ipad but it is a very good tablet for le than dollar my only mplaint is that it do not have a true gps chip and relies on your wifi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true gps but it is a great travel tablet and with an sd card you can download your amazon or other ntent and watch offline a great travel tablet
great the product is upto the mark kid will love it
i loved this kindle fire tablet you cannot beat the price it is great for in the car and a a back up system it is not a good a my kindle paper white but like i said great for a back up and it ha other feature that the paper white doe not

very fun for the whole family we have remmended this to our friend
so far i m enjoying it but i do miss my wireless headset receiver on the roku remote remote i switched because im able to put kodi on the fire tv you cannot on roku
waste of money
the text is easier to read and i do not have to have a light in order to read when the room light is dim or if it is dark
lol the only reason i bought this tablet wa so i uld load my game from my phone and play them on larger screen but i didnt realize that sonce it an amazon product it wont load google play or support vlash of clan or any other google game a big thumb down i guess im just stuck with a tablet that is useless for me
love this tablet it wa a great gift and it worked nice
speaker is really ol sound great easy to use love the fact that it is portable only downside i see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button not always listening
a a charger it work but is nothing special with a mk kindle fire it doe not seem to charge any faster than the standard charger and no cable is included a kindle specific cable must be purchased separately this is not mentioned in the description
it is an ok tablet a i am using it i lose my page quite often and have to go back to find it again also i lose internet connection or am unable to connect at all for the money i find it acceptable but not ideal
great tablet for kid and beginner i would remmend for anyone looking for an easy to use tablet
great sound almost perfect interaction and portable i have the dot and now the tap the new update allowing voice activation is awesome great toy
i like everything about this product i bought for daughter and she love it
this wa gift and it wa totally unexpected it is amazing i cant wait connect it to other equipment the tv the thermostat it is like being captain kirk
my daughter love the amazon fire tablet that i purchased for her

short on memory but easily expands with memory stick work great for everyday task
my son like his amazon fire tablet and it loud he is hearing impaired it great for him
this is my first e reader but i have numerous mobile device and i can say without hesitation that this reader is awesome it is just like reading a book i have no mplaints fit my need perfectly very pleased with my purchase
the item is good but keep frozen i need some advice
love it i like being able to read when the light are off
please do not let the cheap price of this tablet fool you i can do a lot with it surfing the web downloading apps playing game etc there is an issue with the volume of amazon fire not quite loud enough for me even when i turn the volume to it max but i think i still did a great decision to buy it good product overall
the amazon fire tv work well and fast downloads many movie to watch
love that prime membership allows me to see all other movie bye bye netflix
perfect for face timing with family perfect for travel
decent tablet access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps
we love this tablet and the price awesome deal it wa so good we going back to get two more it is amazing cannot say no more except get you one
easy to setup and use ton of apps and game to choose from
wa thinking of getting my year old her own ipad or the kindle i m so glad that i picked the kindle it me with a kid version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate game movie and apps even though she cannot read yet she love it too
bought for my wife to be able to read outside she love it and u it all the time over her first generation kindle fire doe not glare when using outside
always learning new thing that it can do to make my life easier if the speaker wa just a little louder it would have gotten star
wait for to be on sale it is worth it definitely you will love it
we love our amazon echo the kid love asking alexa to play song and pairing this with a portable battery for the echo is a perfect way to move alexa around the house highly remmend getting this over the dot
love the product price would remmend customer
work great i can stream netflix and a ton of other apps
good for smaller kid that cannot play or get to play on xbox game with other sibling
ive always been a fan of mad max and this game surely is satisfying pure action at it best
the firetv is definitely faster than the firestick and the performance is most noticeable when navigating across both native and third party menu relative to the roku the amazon user interface is lacking and a bit cumbersome to navigate but all that doe not really matter if you re getting it for the same reason i did kodi
easy for a year old to learn the apps on the tablet are very good
super easy to set up and absolutely worth the money
i bought this for my son and he absolutely love it i even use it too
it wa a gift so i can really only mment on the quality of the box it wa very square and well proportioned the cellophane wa slick but not overly so overall a decent tactile sensation
my kid love this it wa one of his favorite christmas present
bought this for my aunt for christmas she had wanted a book reader but then she decided she wanted something she uld play game on she is very happy with it
it is a great tool to have i like playing my music on mmand or setting a timer for something oking plus small enough to keep on your unter
i have the amazon stick and wanted a little more speed and storage which this wa just great for
have the smaller fire hd tablet and wa looking at the larger tablet but read the review and when this tablet came on sale at an extremely great price purchased this one am very happy with it although the photo quality is not a good a my samsung galaxy it is fine in most lighting situation it is feature are good and would purchase it again
very goodwas undecided between new paperwhite and voyage model and doing a lot of research to see which one is best based on some personal analysis on in store sample i felt the voyage ha nothing more price worthy than what new pw uld offer with lesser if you are undecided like me do not worry about the gimmick of voyage go for pw
bought it for my daughter she read a lot she had the reader version for year but went blank
i purchased a uple of these to mpliment the main unit i have one in each room a well in my kitchen this way i dont have to worry if alexa heard me or not they work perfectly the only downside i have seen so far is i have a bluetooth speaker that i play music thru and it paired with one echo but if you are near a different echo and ask it to play music it will not default ro the one with the speaker but start playing thru the echo itself i have not searched for a work around and it possible that this is just my own setup mess up so i will still give star
bought this tablet for my year old grandpa and he love it easy to use
not quite a accurate a the mmercials imply but good for music and parlor trick like asking sillly question
doe not answer a many question a led to believe should have google instead of bing a simple alarm clock is all i use it for not much good for anything else would have returned it but i like gadget do not remmend purchasing
this device ha added to our family ability to be better organized a well a the great entertainment value it ha added to our family it also ha allowed me to explore new music that i would not normally listen to at any given time thanks
easy to set up and operate nvenient to operate over using my smart phone very quick response
my kid love it a they can ask alexa to play kid bop radio on sirius
this is the th kindle i have purchased not because of issue but because everyone in my house want one this last one i purchased for my year old he is very happy he can play game like his older sibling on his own kindle now
this is perfect my kid to do their school work on and have fun a well
got this a a gift we have really enjoyed listening to different music and radio station

we now own echo we have them in our bedroom and living area it really is an amazing device we use it to turn many of our light on and off ntrol our outside sprinkler system wake u up with alarm listen to all kind of music and other information i also use it to monitor my amazon purchase and buy thing on amazon that we have purchased before i understand there now are over function it can perform depending on what you desire once you get one you will wonder how you lived without it
i bought this to go with the toshiba k tv with built in chromecast i bought from best buy it is nice when it work but i had problem with it that caused me to return it i have a fire stick and it work great i leave it plugged in but it need to be unplugged every few week otherwise it work fairly well the fire tv had to be unplugged after every use the screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound if i left it plugged in for any amount of time then it would not work well i liked the voice search on it and alexa work great you can ask for the weather play music and presumably other thing that the echo dot and tap can do just a side note you have to keep the button pressed when asking alexa to do something maybe i had a defective unit maybe it wa something else but i have had a paperwhite and a voyage that both died on me in similar way i have never had a problem with the lower end kindles or fire tablet based on my limited experience amazon just doe not get it higher end product right i m still going to use amazon for a variety of thing but i no longer trust them for the higher end product that they make and sell
i bought this kindle for the extra size i have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so i figured with the size it may be easier it wa and i really like being able to change the lor of the font and background it seems to help immensely

overall i am happy with my amazon fire hd it wa easy to take and use on a recent trip although the delta app doe not work with it so that wa a little frustrating not crazy about seeing the ad that pop up but for a purchase price of sale it is hard to mplain this is my first tablet and i find it to be the perfect size and easy to use i would remmend it to anyone who want to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading surfing the web playing game and a a lightweight device travel option i am very happy with the look of the game and everything on the screen i can see myself using it more at home now although i will still use my laptop when i want a bigger screen i bought it in the store they were out of case so i remmend buying a case that also act a a stand i found one on amazon that wa inexpensive and came in an array of lors
easy to install very nice but hopefully it will be cheaper
great addition to smart home seamless integration with smartthings hub hue light and rachio sprinkler ntroller
easy to use doe a good job of voice regnition
i have to start by saying the last thing i wanted or needed wa another device in my system being an apple household i would prefer that my appletv handle the function that i purchased the firetv for namely amazon prime video but apparently the feud between apple and amazon wonend in favor of their customer and amazon wonbe building a prime video app for atv so i picked up a fire tv and have to say i m impressed especially for the price many apps including prime video and music netflix voice ntrol even k though i have not tried that no airplay of urse so i cannot get rid of my atv and it doe not integrate with my mac the way atv doe bottom line i got it for prime and it doe a great job for a non apple house it would be all you need

i didnhave any expectation before buying the fire tablet which may have been a good thing with the disunt offered over black friday i just uld not resist well i am totally amazed at how good it is especially nsidering that it only st me i download ebooks from my library surf the web do my email so what is there not to like sure it doe not have all the bell and whistle of an ipad but for me it is the ideal portable internet device even better than my mobile phone
setup wa going great until the remote stopped working replaced battery several time but did not help had to return product
the tablet ha been working fine i would prefer instruction on the pc to explain how to do thing versus on the tablet itself but my older son is able to figure out how to do thing and my year old daughter who got the tablet seems to be navigating around fairly easily so i am satisfied so far
love it play any music get weather news sport info and so much more create shopping list and reminder it is also an alarm clock and can make your home a smart home with some accessory

very simple design which make it very easy for me to navigate through any screen
surprisingly good picture quality and easy to use
to begin with this is the best reader available right now brighter than the pw just awesome whether or not it a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic either way it is a great piece of hardware light good grip light etc there is one huge issue however the background light is not uniform it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device for a device thats unacceptable how much that bother u will be subjective and u wont notice it a much once u get into your book the problem wa present on all device i purchased and returned to the exact same degree i kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like it a production issue going through amazon review various online forum it seems to be present on a large number of device if not all amazon refuse to address the issue probably because they ll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product like the iphone antenna problem bottom line great device but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue youtube it if u cant visualize what i m talking about ton of video out there describing it how bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck or which batch your local bestbuy ha stock from and most importantly it will bother you what youre willing to settle for in my case i hated it but there wa no alternative the pw seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head mparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it if thats a problem for you wait for the edition the pw had this issue apparently and it wa addressed quietly by amazon in the pw
definitely my favorite e reader that i have ever owned
awesome product enjoy using it everyday would definitely remmend

i love the echo have been using it nstantly to play music for reminder calendar entry etc very satisfied
the amazon tap put out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device a few thing to note if you re not familiar with the tap or have not seen it in person it is roughly the size of a glass of water by default you do have to press the microphone button to talk to alexa but a of an update released on feb th there is an option in the alexa app to make the tap always listen without pushing the button at the expense of battery life the speaker grille is not metal though it look like it in picture it is a mesh fabric similar to what you d feel on the end of some speaker grille and micrphones it is firm and mfortable to hold but if you push hard enough it doe flex using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock a there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case you can charge the tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro usb cable one is included into the back of the speaker
having owned numerous streaming device apple tv chromecast roku fire tv stick and now fire tv used on various tv set in the house i can say fire tv is my favorite the attractive interface and slick navigation upled with what i would nsider excellent ntent i truly enjoy my fire tv the most and future proofed with k resolution just top it off
from news to music to the weather and much more the amazon echo make morning and shower a lot more fun the voice regnition is best i have ever seen alexa can hear me from my bedroom while it stationed in the living room
she say it give her what she want and love it very much
the kindle is great for just reading book and the battery power is pretty good the experimental browser is not very user friendly
i got this for my mother for mother is day and so far she absolutely love it it is fast great resolution and i have yet to hear of any battery issue from her i picked this one for the reason i just listed in addition to the access to amazon underground free apps that normally st with googly play apple store respectively for those reason in addition to the price you cannot go wrong
my grandson cannot put it down with access to so many educational apps and game you really cannot lose
i bought it for work and play and it is working out great for both
love it for the kid for educational apps and for required school work and web browsing
great item for book reader very happy with purchase a i love to read
the echo is a nice speaker that ha the added bonus of being able to respond to question and give sometimes useful information however in regard to it being capable of serving a the brain of an integrated automated home it lack much i purchased it to use with philip hue bulb and i wa hoping my fire tv although it share the same software with the fire and logically should be able to work together it doe not echo will not connect to or ntrol the tv a far a the philip hue bulb it cannoturn on individual bulb or even a group of bulb if and only if you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it it cannot dim the light set light scene or any of the oler option the philip hue bulb are capable of i wound up going back to using my iphone which respond to voice mmand of hey siri better than the echo anyway if i had to do it over again i would have saved the money and gone with a simple bluetooth speaker for my phone a it can already do many of the thing the echo doe only difference is that the phone doe not have a big of a range for voice pickup i did give the echo three star because the one thing it doe well is respond to question like what is the weather like that feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly for
excellent product kindle amazon ha an extensive library of book to choose from love the back light light weight and excellent for travel when you do not want the weight of book but want your book to read
this wa a gift for my girlfriend she love the paperwhite screen is great and the ppi is very sharp highly suggested
love my amazon echo everything exactly a advertised
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy wa able to get one to me on the day of it release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i wa unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and it battery charging ver together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without it ver feel impossibly light at ounce size wise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle design that i had to mpare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screen are actually the same size they are it is the first kindle i think i uld easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent traveler like me this is a key reason to buy one of these a it is extremely mpact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first front lit kindle i have ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the led from any angle no dark spot no bright spot just a mpletely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both direction the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper it is sharp and clear better than any kindle i have used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnet after doing so this is where the amazon engineering team is achievement really beme clear a you just wonbelieve how lightweight this thing is it is easy to imagine holding onto it for hour without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degree when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn button also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change page a you always have with earlier touch screen model the battery on the reader ha a lower capacity than the ver is battery so it run down faster if you do not have it connected to the case it is very easy to snap the reader back into it ver which allows it to recharge while you ntinue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper top right rner more or le opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be le awkward a it is easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprint and they are not so easy to clean off you d think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now it is a minor annoyance lot of reviewer in the tech press have mplained loudly about this model is high price relative to other kindle model without ad it is v for an ad le paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that is easy on both your arm and your eye then i personally think it is worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you nsider how many month you ll have to wait to get one on amazon is website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look i m definitely keeping mine
i got this a a send kindle e reader a well a an educational and leisure tablet i also have a kindle keyboard i thought that i wa not going to enjoy reading on the fire because of the back light but it is very adjustable and ha a setting to turn the blue light off for reading at night i also wanted my kindergarten student to be able to use it educationally it ha a kid mode with great parental setting and an option to pay a month for ton of awesome ntent
bought it for my brother and he absolutely love it
doesnot work after three weeksi cannot open it so sad
our rd amazon fire the battery life is outstanding really nice when reading a book not having to worry about the battery nice size
very educational and simply fun like a new friendhavi g too much fun with her still exploring more to educate her even better a must myst buy and i dont typically buy gadget
crystal clear screen easy to use reading for day night excellent
set up wa really easy it ha been really fun to play with i have enjoyed the email that me giving tip about different mmands and fun thing it will do

really good product voice mmands work a lot better than expected even just using it a a speaker i feel like i got my money worth
i love the nvenience of the amazon echo alexa is amazing very easy to use
amazon ha been marekting this via email to me for a while didnthink much of it at first until i found out this work well with home automation i have almost every light in my home connected using a smartthings hub i look so ol to my friend that have never seen an echo before with a quick mmand i cannoturn on or off any of my connected light one by one or use an ifttt mmand to turn everything on or off yes it work with ifttt you can get pretty creative with it having a multi level home i can mmand echo alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my ring doorbell this is one ol device for lazy people like me lol i use it to get the weather traffic sport sres go warrior and create add item to my shopping list it play music from numerous streaming music service but being a prime member and having used everything from pandora to spotify i find prime music the best for my taste in music it is also free with my prime membership so i do not have to listen to ad or get stuck not being able to skip a song i do not particularly like i have also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory i leave the echo in my dining room kitchen area and i can send mmands to echo from my bedroom without a glitch i cannot wait for my echo dot to arrive call me an echo fanatic but i tell you it is an awesome piece of technology and it keep getting better a amazon ntinues to develop and add new feature my only gripe is that i cannot ntrol my home security system with it simplisafe just doe not want to play with anyone boo
i am an old traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back book now i do not lose what page i wa on and have more shelf space where book used to be
i enjoy reading ebooks on this tablet a well a watching video it is just so handy to carry around in my purse
wa not a fan of having to get one of these i m kinda old school i like book but it really wa a nice device easy to use and read from glad i got it
i got this because i didnwant to set another cable box in my room i do not watch a lot of tv to begin with what i like about the fire tv is that you can download apps such a the uverse app from att and watch live tv from it and other apps like history channel netflix food channel you can also buy an app that let you connect your smart phone to the tv so if you have a movie on your phone or laptop that the fire tv doe not have you can connect it and mirror it and it will appear on your tv almost a having a cable box but you only pay once and not every month for it the ntrol doe get disnnected a lot i do not know if it is the amazon battery or if it is the remote over it good for someone who doe not watch a lot of tv
i live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place ol
the sleek design and lors available for small kid is good the tablet is a nice price and useful
the kindle paperwhite is reliable hold a charge for week is lightweight and easy to hold allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone because of the backlit surface and store hundred of book what can i say i love my kindle and this one wa the send i have bought this one a a gift for an elderly parent she love it the font is easy to adjust for people who need large print i take my kindle everywhere so i am never bored whether i am waiting in the doctor is office or stuck in an airport overseas

love that i can read inside with the paper white i replace my originalkindle with this

not many thing she doe not know got echo a gift for christmas
the echo wa easy to setup it understands my mmands most of the time the only mplaint is that it is speaker is not up to par with other speaker
i would remmend this product to anyone that love reading e book
i bought four of these for christmas gift everyone really seems to enjoy them i didnrealize that i uld put the game i bought on amazon on all of them bonus

super durable hardware that ha endless feature from streaming to playing game this thing is awesome
my wife love it since she is home alone in the day time
i bought one once before for my mother and this product is amazing i recently bought another to replace my girlfriend is nook is amazing how good this e reader performs the battery life and versatility
wa purchased for a child work well and provides basic function that were needed
there is not much to say it is really a simple device and that is why i got it it is for reading on a screen that wonbother my eye after a long period of time there are ad but they are all specifically for the device and are not intrusive your book are listed above the ad
work well except during internet outage the ability to perform hand free task in the kitchen is priceless
i bought this for my niece for christmas i must say it is fast and me with amazon underground apps which are all free great value
i would buy this again i like the voice system and i would remmend it to my friend
i now have access to music in my bedroom i love it
enjoy playing game and checking email and face book on this still learning everything it can do
just say alexa and what you want her to do and she doe it yes sometimes if there is some noise or if you do not speak clearly she might get it wrong but most of the time she get it right my only flaw with alexa is the music which is not a problem with the product it is self but when it me to playing music other than pandora you do have to subscribe to unlimited music which is reasonably priced and is worth it but do wish it came with it other than that i love asking alexa to play a certain song and she play it she is amazing i would remmend it to anyone also look into her ol feature their so helpful definitely her to do list and grocery list
for the price the tablet can not be beat i use this over my ipads that i have there is nothing i cant do with this tablet
aside from being about the only eink reader still available the amazon kindle series of reader offer bang for the buck and feature that you do not know you need the paperwhite reader is great in sunlight in a lit room or even in a darkened room the available kindle book offer a tremendous variety of genre and title for a low st and with shareware nverters like calibre classic available through public domain are all there to be read if you love book then this is for you
i loved the tablet doe what it suppose to do
already had a amazon fire for year still working fine bought of these a gift doe what it is meant to do and great to leverage your amazon prime stuff do not bother if you are expecting a ipad like feel
had bought the amazon tap and then decided to try echo and feel it is definitely a step up in ease to use and sound
i wa hesitant to buy a kindle paperwhite a i already owned an entry level kobo that wa about year old however i m goad that i upgraded a this device is smaller lighter and more ergonomic it a lot easier to hold for an extended period of time additionally a part of the kindle esystem borrowing e book from the library is a snap and no longer requires me to hook up to my mputer
slow advertisement plagued save and spend money on something better
love this got it jail broken so i can watch anything i want
i had a lot of eye strain issue when trying to read off of my i pad and i just uld not get mfortable while reading a book in bed this purchased changed everything i am now going through book a month and i am doing so cheaply
the sound is amazing and it life up to all the hype
this tablet is very affordable and ha more then enough thing to do on it ha feature more expensive tablet have at a fraction of the st if something were to happen to it it would not be a crazy tragedy due to the price it is listed at
i originally purchased a kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one very easy to read on watch movie and listen to music
i will try again for the rd time with my new amazon fire it seems to have nice upgrade
i bought this for myself a an early christmas present and i m in love the sound quality is awesome and alexa tell the funniest yet shortest story in history
i purchased two for my kid for christmas they are not a easy to maneuver a an ipad but they loved them
very fast excellent quality the most i like is alexa you can ask whatever you want and she will respond
the kindles were good while they worked day best buy wa good about replacing them very frustrating though to have to get them replaced when my kid only played on them for three day
wa about to purchase another tablet for more money else where when another shopper informed me of the kindle fire being available at best buy for wa able to purchase a name brand tablet for le i wa all in going to best buy to make the purchase wa well worth the trip and the price the kindle fire ha not let me down to date i can read book google read my email and most thing i can do on my mputer
bought for my child age and they all seem to love them my only problem is the battery life is low so they are always mplaining that they are shutting off for a parent that is not to big a problem unless you work from home and are trying to keep them quite
keep me busy great tablet i am always home bored now i am stuck on netflix and play my game do my homework log into to work
this wa a gift for a senior citizen that is not a fan of mputers and technology after just a few minute of instruction she picked right up on how much fun she uld have with her down loaded game and she also learned how to reach out on the internet for information on subject that interest her she is very happy with her gift
love my kindle paperwhite love that you can read it outdoors
very nvenient perfect size and easy on the eye i never though i would stop reading paperback but this make reading a library of different book much more nvenient
this is a great product alexa is always available to answer my question play my music ntrol smart device in my home
the fire tv ha changed the way we watch television we no longer have expensive cable and do not miss it at all
i bought the kindle fire mostly for use a an mp a a black friday deal of only uld not beat it so far it is working great a an mp i wa able to download song and playlist from my mputer purchasing game and book have also been easy
my grandson love this tablet with all of the apps and the game also
very good product especially if you are into high end hq tv product fast easy to operate
i started our with just the fire stick at home once i purchased a k tv i decided to splurge on the fire tv i m so glad i did the one thing that annoyed me about the stick wa relying on wifi stability and now i have ran an ether net straight to my router so problem solved
the amazon fire hd is a great tablet at a bargain price purchased at christmas time for it is an even better value if you have an amazon prime acunt only downside is the use of amazon is appstore instead of the google play store which ha more variety
i ordered this for a person that ha very limited use of his hand and this voice activated device ha made a huge difference in his life had geek squad set up with the harmony home mpanion and now he can adjust and change the tv channel without assistance made a huge difference in his life
i love the amazon echo so much i ordered two plus am planning on ordering the echo dot along with the nest thermostat switch that are alexa enabled and the ebee that is alexa enabled i would highly remmend them to friend and family
if you are using with mpatible smart device in your home e g we use with phillips hue bulb echo is great we do get a bit frustrated with the search capability i suspect google home is better at web search much of the time we ask a question alexa say she doe not understand the question search is pretty limited to wikipedia there are many skill you can enable and some of them are fun helpful but then you have to remember what to say to use the skill i think this will be even more useful a we add smart device to our home
got this for our granddaughter to take on a spring break trip she read the whole way wonderful
i am enjoying my echo and keep trying to find new u for it having fun playing with all the feature
great for grandkids my six year old grandson love it
this is my first ereader i have wanted one for awhile but wa not impressed with feature until the two most recent version of paperwhite were released i have the latest version i have read a few book and several magazine on it so at this point i m familiar with it basic functionality is excellent for reading text it is pretty straightforward magazine article with image worked well for me but i can see where screen formatting uld be an issue for more mplex illustration the backlight is very good i would not buy an ereader without it page flip are lightening fast and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure i have a few mplaints see below nice integration with the amazon leather ver you can just close the book and it shuts down buying book from amazon is simple and they are delivered via my home wifi in sends battery life seems endless and recharge is simple the included cable charge via a pc wall charger is an accessory you must purchase great device for older reader a you can kick up the font size and lighting for squint free reading it is about the size of a small paperback book and a light a a feather my mplaints ad are mildly annoying it is aggravating to pay more for an ad free version availability of book from my local library remain shockingly limited even though these device are hardly new the amazon library for book loan available for a monthly fee is also very limited i had a day trial period during which time i searched for several classic novel on both amazon and my local library big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list want to read catch or atlas shrugged you have got to buy it highlighting is clumsy using a finger although i have improved over time changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tab is useless if you like to flip through a book the paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book if you have read page but went forward to see something on page you ll return to next time if you flip around a lot you ll get a real mess manual bookmark are the only solution it is my understanding that when you buy a book from amazon you are getting a license to read that book on an amazon device only you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device so if you buy a different brand of ereader year from now you ll have to rebuy your library despite all this i m glad i bought it and would remmend it if you d like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet
needed a new kindle wa not sure what one to choose this one is great
keep up with my appointment e mail and all sort of thing i love it
when i decided on this i wa shopping for something but didnknow what after using i have decided this is it doe all i need
i love to read and this kindle paperwhite is great and being a bookbub member i get free book automatically loaded to my kindle and borrowing book from the library is eady and trouble free
great purchase really worth it if you have netflix hulu and stream other thing to phase out cable easy to use
my daughter is away at school and she u this inexpensive amazon tablet which she wonis should something happen to it and it ll be easy to replace it ha all the function she need though it doe not support some apps but it doe support all the popular social medium and ha a decent camera it is easy to use big enough to read on but it is not huge and it is easy to hold store and carry my daughter enjoys the orange ver
so happy to find this item in store salesman made sure the price wa lowest possible
it is very easy and light to use and the back light is very similar to real paper so it is my best friend anywhere especially in bed before falling a sleep
i bought this for my mom who didnhave a tablet at the time and she had no idea what to do with it but with very little help from me she figured it out through the tutorial provided the screen is not a large a i would have hoped but it doe the job
bought this for my nephew since he dropped his last one in the toilet and we didnpurchase the accidental verage last time he is only but love to play game on it since it is linked to my amazon acunt i can see what game he is downloading and ntrol the purchase made definitely a must have for long car ride
got this for my parent to allow my dad to bring music into his family room i own both the echo and thee dot love the simplicity of the personal assistant connected to my hue light and nest thermostat alexa allows my wife to ntrol our light play music or get a flash briefing via voice mmands speaker is pretty good for a stand alone unit voice regnition is very good if you have home automation device like hue wink nest or othe the echo make them better than ever
this wa a great buy for me you can watch many movie and tv show for free
i like the tablet it is vary good for reader who like to read my kid read book on it alot
this is the send tablet i have purchased aimed for little one and it is by far the best easy to access his game and plenty of preloaded game video and apps it make road trip so much happier
wow best price for a tablet if google did with chromecast to pave streaming world this tablet with amazon underground will be the next phase of free app world to me
this thing ha major connectivity issue save your money and wait for a later version
i am impressed with the quality and speed of this tablet i wa a little worried about not having access to the google play store but this ha not been a big issue so far the speed functionality and battery life have exceeded my expectation
i have my echo setup in my kitchen a that is where i get the most use of it there is a learning curve to figuring out it limitation and getting it setup though after that it is a fun device to use like i can add thing to my grocery list or play a podcast or play prime music or turn on light or give me the weather and sport sres i am slowing setting my home up to have connected device and this wa a great starting device i would say if you have spotty internet service this thing will not work but when you are on dsl you get what you pay for right
i purchased this fire tablet a a christmas gift for my husband he is learning to use it and so far like it really well he ha not downloaded any book yet but he now ha an email address and will soon have a facebook acunt his brother sister live around the untry so now he will be able to keep in contact with them
bought this a a cheaper alternative for using with kid battery last longer than most tablet the reason why i gave this such a mediocre rating is because you cannot put a wallpaper for the lock screen you always have an ad for something amazon related which can be annoying but if it is just something small for the kiddos to use good choice i would not remmend for adult
i love the preloaded apps there are to choose from for all age the book selection is expansive my year old play with it everyday it great for trip in the car or just being around the house great buy i enjoy playing with alexa ask her anything and she ha an answer
loved my kindle so much i bought one for my wife too she love the kindle and find we both devote more time to reading

i got this for my year old mother to view pic on facebook of her child grandchild great grandchild and great great grandchild with the kid protection bumper she is able to handle it well the bad side is that i wanted to hide all the other apps and uld not plus i ended up paying an extra to get rid of ad
we already saved money purchasing this and getting rid of direct tv monthly charge
i can read anytime and anywhere
this edition doe not have backlighting which is a big deal if you like reading in bed or indoors without needing to use external lighting you should not get this version get one of the newer edition if you only read in well lit area then go for this one kindle is fantastic and i love my white lightweight long lasting kindle with the option to use background light
run better that a fire stick and it buffer faster two great for streaming netflix and hulu in hd i have not had any issue with these program and if you have amazon prime you can link your acunt for streaming purchasing and renting title

my husband love this they battery life is aweseome nice to take when traveling
i love kindle paper white a it is lightweight and the feeling is the same a reading a book because of the background lor

much more than a bluetooth speaker it is great to listen to music from pandora amazon etc with it streaming directly from wifi save the battery on my phone a others have said i wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all time but i guess they didnput that in to save battery life maybe something for the next generation tap
bought unit on black friday a a gift it is good thus far wish it wa easier to get back to the home screen other than that i like the unit
easy to work no issue my daughter love it and my year old love it too
i cannot ask for this tablet to more than what it supposed good starter for kid before they get an ipad
decent little tablet if you are not a game player tablet shuts down and i cant get it back on when i play game for long period of time it is not my ipad that is for sure
great sound and smart just wish the volume didnt have to b manually turned
great little device time to cut the cable easy to set up and program
i have been nsidering the whole smart home phenomenon for a while even though i love tech in general this particular aspect didnseem to have much appeal for me personally my impression wa that it hadnquite arrived yet then some friend got the echo along with the hue lighting system and the nest thermostat when i saw how well it all integrated and just how ol it is i wa intrigued that wa enough for me to take the plunge now i have all three and i love how they all work together alexa is at the heart of it with many handy feature she can give me weather traffic and news she cannoturn on or turn off my light and adjust the heat she can set a timer when i m oking she can check my google calendar to remind me of appointment and birthday she can answer many but certainly not all of my random trivia question some of her response are funny and cute easter egg her built in shopping and to do list are rather basic so i have not found much use for them yet she process my request with only the occasional misunderstanding her microphone are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stair in my townhome although i did get the optional remote for the bedroom only sometimes do i have to repeat myself if i do not speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward amazingly she know to ntrol the rrect fixture when for example i accidentally say table lamp instead of table light a the bulb is actually labeled in the system the setup wa quick and easy both for the echo itself and the integration with the nest and the hue bridge the app is easy to use with only one minor issue see below her internal speaker are not spectacular but they re acceptable for background music while doing chore or puttering around the house using the app to establish a connection to the bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wa not particularly intuitive but following the instruction posted on the amazon web site got it done now i can stream music through the echo itself or through my stereo for better quality depending on my mood you can integrate service like pandora and spotify but i just use amazon prime music since i already subscribe to it naysayer will rightly point out that you can do all of the above thing with other simpler device and of urse they re right the echo is certainly a luxury a toy even but it is fun and useful for me in my experience and for my purpose it work well with only minor limitation it met and exceeded my expectation you have to judge the overall value for yourself but if you re already nsidering the echo and what it can do for you i strongly remmend it
bought this a a gift for my family mainly to play music from amazon very pleased with how easy it is to set up and use
very ol to be able to give voice instruction and get news and music via voice work great
gave these a gift for christmas and everyone loved them the are small and full of fun

great tablet for the price good size and great value
bestbuy wa offering some disunts during thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy i wa not an avid before and just casually bought this product but i must admit i am not at all disappointed with this work best with english book doe not work that well with native book also this product is not backlit and doe not have any option to increase the screen brightness and i would deduct star for that you need to install another product called calibre in your mputer to nvert book to kindle readable format mobi kindle can also read pdf but mobi format is better readable mpared to kindle
this is my first time using any amazon product so far so good no mplaints
my year old granddaughter love her amazon kid edition it is amazing how she know how to get to her favorite educational program i live the lor pink case very sturdy

this is a nice little tablet for the i paid on black friday at the regular price i would probably have gone with something a little le restricted and without so much amazon ntent the lock screen ad are not much of a problem i understand amazon sell these cheap and get it back via ad but the amazon apps are a little much it would be easier to stomach if you uld add the one you want or remove the one you do not that said i wa able to install the google play store and this tablet doe everything i need it to do overall i m pretty happy with the purchase it is a nice new toy one note in the online photo the magenta look purple it is actually pink if you like purple get a black one and a purple case

i purchased the kindle fire for a vacation we were going on and really only thought i would use it for book and maybe a few game but wa surprised at how well i wa able to access the internet with it the only thing that i can say negative about it is the sun glare in the sun it is next to impossible to see what is on the screen indoors or shade and it is fine

this tablet is great for the kid however if going out of untry might not work didnfor me overall the kid enjoy
kindle fire is a decent tablet the only turn off is the way amazon ha massacred the android o and make it inmpatible with chromecast most of the time it is a great tablet for reading and saving medium on the go other than the o kindle fire is a decent buy

nsistent with all the review this is a great product no downside if you are anywhere of the mindset to use this type of device have a ipad mini and phone with the kindle app but this is so much better

if you are planning on buying a amazon fire stick rensider and buy the fire tv far superior better display and faster processor
i love the e it ha been on of the best thing i have purchased in a long time
this device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had google play however amazon chose to block access to it this took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money this is my last amazon branded product if you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device
i quit cable all together and stream everything i watch using this box

great purchase wa gift for friend and they love it
i had got the original for the wife she finally needed a new one so when i saw this online i had to get her a new one she love it
for a w a wall charger that deal is right up there with the hdmi cable best buy want to sell you here is what you do find an old cell phone charger laying around somewhere that say w a ma and use it you can safely use up to watt and anything between and amp ma ma if you do not have an extra cell phone charger lying around just buy a well reviewed power adapter with the above specification that connects to your kindle micro usb they can be found for under locally or through amazon
i am very impressed with this tablet it is faster than some ipads i have used i gave this a a gift and my mother in law love it thank you
i bought this a a gift for my four year old to read onand play educational game on she love it and it wa a great price
i went back and forth about what kind of tablet to purchase for my child i am very impressed with the ability for thing to be simple for her to navigate a well a being able to place perimeter on how long she can use the apps internet and watch video a well a how much reading time she ha to have
it is simple to use and i have had no issue do need decent internet speed to stream live tv
inexpensive but well built easy navigation stream movie well sound is decent but requires headphone generally screen is good size and clear finding a case for this model is a challenge i found on line but expensive nsidering tablet price universal case do not work due to button placement
i love the amazon echo easy to use with great speaker
if you have an amazon echo already then you know what a great gadget it is this is echo in baby size and portable the newer version can be woken up with your voice like it big sister or you can program it to only respond when you push the mike button it had all the feature of echo and excellent sound for it size i have it in the bedroom and use it a an alarm and music when i get dressed all in all a great item for the price
i like to hear the news flash plus my tune the kid have fun with it too
very easy basic e book reader good for beginner to start
i had a very early generation kindle that i loved i wa unwilling to update my kindle because it wa so great the new one i got from my wife made it look like the old one wa standing still it is much faster and i love it
one ha to keep the price of this in mind for just you do indeed get a lot it performs fairly well too for the most part i didnnotice any lag or anything but the resolution is not very high good and it is not the best display if you plan on doing lot of reading it is just fine for video though the tablet ha an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind
even though the ppi is lower than the other tablet i didnreally notice it i like the letterbox format which allows the use of more of the screen area when viewing movie and tv
great little tablet for someone who is always on the go
after the initial trial question found our alexa is vocabulary is minimum and doe not respond most of the time
this wa a mother is day gift from my son i had wanted one for awile it ha surpass my expectation i love it
this is a great system and i really enjoy it i would remmend this to a friend
just plug it in and off you go easiest electronic setup there is di turn out i didnneed it a the samsung tv i bought ha the amazon prime app on it
i love everything about the kindle fire but i would like a bigger screen
this kindle is great customer service rep for technical question not so much
i bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle we love it except for the fact it would not connect to att internet i suspect this wa an att problem the internet uld not be authenticated since we have had problem with att for seven year i am sure it wa a problem with them once my si read the instruction she wa good to go
small and light weight even in a leather case i wa ncerned about the small screen but wa not a problem after using it for a while
bought for my eight year old she absolutely love it
i wanted to like this a lot because my ipad mini is heavy to carry in my purse all the time this is so very light but they make you jump through hoop to get rid of all the advertising on the device and when you buy it at best buy you are not given a choice to spend an extra on a dollar book or put up with their ad i had to go through being on hold forever to get someone to help get this off my device so that wa an immediate turn off i do not find it to page turn handle a well a my old original nook or nook lor and certainly not anything like the ipad mini if i hadnt kept it too long to return i would have it doe not auto rrect to landscape then portrate nope you have to manually choose one or the other and going back and forth is just stupid it should have been part of the improved design they really missed the mark for the price i can get a full tablet for le money that doe all that and simply use the kindle appproslight weightsmall for purseback lightns me preloaded with ad not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store page ntrol is not that simpledoes not auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one or the other not a touch responsive to anything do not like the organization of it
purchased a a sendary tablet to my ipad so that i uld have an inexpensive one to use that i didnhave to worry about easy to set up ha great speed like that it ha expandable memory
these are wonderful item easy to use and work fast service and save on my cable bill
the echo is the olest tech in my home with alexa there to answer all question play music and read book the possibility are endless just check it out
amazon did a fantastic job i gave it to my father a a christmas gift and he love it
work with all my stuff speak and she shall mply
full of knowledge and easy to hook up would recmend
i love the fact that is very practical and i didnhave to spend a lot of money
work well but after memory build it start acting up shuts on and off randomly but for the price it is ok
this is a great product with many option for movie game music and much much more
perfect for light surfing and reading do not expect much for this price range
this is a full featured tablet at a remarkable price i have used this tablet on a daily basis and not been disappointed the only shortming i have found is that tablet case cannot put the tablet to sleep or wake it when the ver is closed or opened given the price however i really have no problem with that omission
the tablet is a good tool to help him with reading
bought for my kid they each have one and love them
my kindle fire hd is quite an upgrade to my old kindle camera is a terrific addition and the screen is so much better
we love the great product that amazon offer we can p lay game and chat with family and friend at the same time i never nsidered purchasing the tablet due to st however shopping for holiday season for my family they absolutely love the product
bought a gift for my parent good tablet for introducing them to smart device
great sound great for playing music or ntrolling your home with some exception do not expect alexa to answer any question you have though sorry i do not know the answer is a mmon response obviously google home is going to have great access to google but cannot alexa at least try
this table is okay for me but it is great for kid
i have a kindle and my grandson u it when he me to visit we decided to get him one
very happy with this product i would remmend for anyone
super inexpensive and easy to use great for my kid
great product easy to read on without feeling like you re staring at a mputer screen no glare at all no matter where i am very easy to hold whether reading sitting or laying down highly remmended
i bought this for my son to read book on and mybe play a few game so far so good no mplaints
the price on this is great there are a uple of issue i have with my kindle but i think it is me not the device sometimes when i shut it off i have to hold down the power button a the box that me up that say ok or cancel doe not work for me the other problem i have is sometimes it doe not go back to where i left off in a book i took it to the store and the tech i had look at it did not have these problem other that that i love it i cannotravel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email movie and book i purchased a case for it that set it up so i do not have to hold it and that made me like it even more
this wa a christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely love it i wa undecided between the fire stick or the fire tv and since a worker ha the fire tv and loved it i went with the fire tv a opposed to the stick especially since there is more memory in the fire tv the tv is about more but worth it
great for the price did research and found this
this wa an upgrade from my amazon inch bigger screen wa the key for me it is great for listening to music reading book watching movie tv sport tv show and playing all the game hour of relaxation and entertainment along with amazon is new alexa
st is not outrageous easy setup fun to use and syncs with my iphone bluetooth practical u for home a well
bought to keep the kiddo entertained work perfect ton of free game
i really liked the idea of having a device i uld talk to out of nowhere that would answer although our cell phone can do similarly but you have to turn them on and press button etc it is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it doe i wa quite disappointed in the ability of alexa to answer any serious question jeff need to pay to send his programmer back to search school so many time alexa say a phrase similar to i do not understand the question so basically i paid for a radio i paid extra for the larger one but the output is still no different than a clock radio me on amazon
i cannot update facebook and a few other apps it is not what i expected
the product it is left work great especially mpared to the stick it is so much faster and ha more memory that you are not nstantly get the low memory notification only problem is the lack of available apps on the app store
we got this for our son he is always wanting to play on mom is tablet so we thought this would be a good choice his aunt doe a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one within a month the charging rd on both unit quit working and shortly after that the port became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they do not charge save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product
throughly enjoying my fire tablet can play game and read book am very pleased with it
overall a great device that ha an amazing sound quality
it is awesome being able to have k capability and being able to play game but it doe get laggy at time
excellent for what you pay and always good shopping at bestbuy
excellent e reader and great deal ver is perfect
i love the echo the speaker is good and alexa is very fast and efficient at answering query and following instruction i had the echo le than a month before deciding to get an echo dot for my bedroom
i purchased this for our goddaughter and while the price is amazing and the tablet is acceptable for low overhead use i set up the same tablet for my daughter and it is too slow for my use
looking for a reader with some basic tablet function this wa just that
great value easy to set up light weight nd very portable will provide hour of entertainment for my child
great lor great item i bought it a a replacement for another brand very happy with this purchase
my husband is an avid reader and what better way to reward him for his love of reading and playing game lol
got this tablet on black friday i love how easy it wa to get this tablet up and going now i do not have to use my phone to get on the internet if you are looking for an affordable tablet this is the one for you
it is a great value for the price just know you do not have the same freedom with a normal android tablet because this run fireos the battery life is good the screen is not the best but hey it is a bargain for kid or just using a a e reader
amazon fire tv box is awesome i love using netflix in k
looking for a present for that young professional or graduate this is great they love technology
this is one of the best purchase i have ever made pay the little extra and get the fire tv
i just love my paperwhite the size is small enough to fit in my purse and pull out whenever i have the time the charge last forever so i m not always looking to plug in i love that i can sit outside and read or in bed at night without light on to disturb husband i belong to a book club so it is nice to be able to add note when i want to and to have the dictionary right there if needed i can hook right onto amazon goodreads or borrow from the library while sitting in bed this is my first kindle so i do not have stuff to mpare it to but i sure love this one
nice little tablet for reading netflix take a while to load if you want to watch it on it
this device performs great for the price it is really a steal affordable and easy to use
very happy customer my daughter love using this
my kid have owned the kindle fire for over year it wa time for them to be more focused on reading and this is one of the best dreaded out there kid love the device and they can quickly borrow book from the city library
the fire tv box is x is better than the firestick it is faster ha more storage and is le glitchy
amazon fire tv great product easy to use it is a direct plug in to your router or bluetooth
great gift for a younger person who want a tablet
loved it very good screen quality and clarity of urse it amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from android isnt available but they have there own version of stuff that is good also my kid loved it i loved it i highly remmend buying it but if your hooked on google play id go with a samsung tablet
this is our send box for our bedroom we got our first over a year ago when we decided we werepaying a cable bill each month we have no mplaints at all
i got mine for a month and i mainly use it to read pdf document from sd card or onedrive the tablet is nothing like the review said it freeze up every time i press home or go to the next page or even to close out when i go on the internet some page do not load fully time only the st half of the page wa loaded i am very disappointed
work great for my year old son a for me i m not that big of a fan because of the apps not that same a android or apply
we love it i just need some help and tip on how to work it
i upgraded from a first gen firestick the fire tv box is lightning fast ton of apps to play with it uld either be an addition to your cable satellite tv experience or it uld help you cut the rd
my year old daughter love this tablet for game and watching netflix and hulu great size for her i like the parental ntrols and easy to monitor her activity and how much time a day she can use it
got this kindle fire to replace a laptop that died so far i have been very pleased finding new thing that it can do not happy with the camera but i might not know all the detail about it yet
good and excellent product and good serive bestbuy
the fire is a perfect tablet and reader you cannot beat the price
it ha everything he need he is using the tablet each day
very easy to use it is small enough to fit in my purse so i can always have a book to read with me
i would buy this item again however charging port is
tablet wa a christmas gift it is just right for the purpose mentioned
great device that simplifies many thing mostly understands what i say even without training it
my grand kid talk to it while doing there homework school project etc i use it for the music it great
work just a it say the echo is a lot of fun to have in your home
alexa definitely make life easier the only downside is that she doe not understand everything you say i mostly use her for music timer and daily weather and news the dot doe not have the sound quality of the full echo though
doe all it claim not yet using much except for music
excellent tablet for the price i use it a a reader and to surf the web
this is a great product my only problem is that it got to hot and had to return it
i bought this for my brother a a gift for graduating from his master program he ha been telling me non stop how much he love it he said the battery last really long and he is having fun filling it up with book to read
i picked this up a a doorbuster for my father in law he ha an amazon acunt and can watch the movie he like
great budget tablet at a great price long battery life and high quality display
i really regret taking so long purchasing the kindle fire the ipad wa being so hyped up to the point that i didnthink the kindle wa a good however the ipad is not a good because after a few year it no longer take update what is the since in purchasing such an expensive item if it cannot accept life long update that wa the purpose of me getting a tablet instead of a regular mputer
this is the best electronic purchase i have had in a year and i buy a lot of shhhtuff
i m no mputer expert so i appreciate how easy it is to use this tablet perfect for facebook email and online search it is fast and unmplicated
i find the picture quality amazing the size over earlier model is welme also battery last many hour for the price it is a real bargain
this is my nd amazon tablet i love it i also bought one for my husband mother in law
my year old dropped this from a standing position about a foot off the ground and it busted i had to use the bb warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should have been able to handle that is designed for kid i m happy with the apps but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kid
if like i you own an earlier generation kindle that is not a paperwhite this latest model is well worth the upgrade if you do not it is like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iphone plus to read your kindle app book and to use goodreads on outdoors it even ha airplane mode it had me at it crisp crisp backlit display and quick response to touch i had to really press v tap on the older kindle and it wa so slow to take load
i like the fact that it me w a case it is easy for the child to operate instruction are clear
i love my fire tv the only thing i do not like is my remote keep freezing i have already change the battery to brand new one twice and it still freeze i m ready to buy a new remote
easy to setup great peoduct i want to remmend this product
love this echo alexa give me weather news appointment unlimited music of amy type a thousand other thing everyone need alexa
i wa not sure i should buy it because i thought it would be a cheaply made tablet for but i wa wrong i love it it is worth it
love what i got work perfect good for my son he love it
i like it flexibility portability and it is the best value option of all three alexas
speaker give off great sound and my kid love it
have used this device for about day with absolutely no mplaints i wa only nsidering a uple of different unit because i mostly use it with playstation vue but we also watch netflix and hulu alexa is a really nice feature mpletely satisfied
easy to install and use love it i am tired of being gouged by cable
this is a really great tablet me and my kid love it
work great but do not like how you have to spell everything out
ok but i would not go to the trouble of buying this again all i get is the weather and some music and it is really a waste of money and time even though siri is slow at least serious with me all the time and this rest on my desk or on the table top and that is about it
this wa an easy purchase over the internet and store pick up i like the fire over the fire stick you get more ram and can side load apps with micro sd card
if you d like a small tablet that can do virtually all that a large one can do this is the one and the price is great
good product for the price screen resolution is decent love the external memory card slot
i have the amazon echo in my kitchen where we run around and usually holding food in our hand while prepping or rushing out it is nice to be able to just call out a certain song or music station to quickly start hearing some music while busy also if we are in a rush to leave and want to know the temperature to make sure to have proper attire this device just make life a little simpler and faster
it is easy to understand the popularity of the alexa echo it is a great accessory that will enhance your entertainment capability
work well my little love it battery life great
this is the best tablet out there great bang for your buck
ntrol many aspect of your home with your voice link not only to amazon and your prime acunt but many other device
fast easy to use would remmend to anyone
we have of these and we love them they are easy to use and you can do lot of different thing on them
purchased for grandson they were not happy with it because it wa not mpatible with their itunes
i wa mpletely under the impression that this tablet wa child friendly but there are no built in restriction so my son wa able to purchase numerous apps and movie my son usually u my wife is ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adult not a young child if you buy this tablet immediately change the setting to require a pin to make purchase i think the age remmendation should be not
my granddaughter ha learned a lot of educational thing on hers
best tablet i have had load up fast and camera is awesome
it is a wonderful tablet and e reader for what you pay my only mplaint is it is a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive i also do not like that i cannot put my ebooks on my memory card it is frustrating other than that it is wonderful
i received the amazon echo a a birthday gift i am not tech savvy so set up wa a bit nfusing for me now that i have the feature i want and need on the device our household u it everyday in fact we bought a xmas gift
fast processor excellent interface you need this if you are cutting the rd
the paper white screen is so easy to read in dark and light nditions i read in bed before going to sleep and the screen brightness is low enough that it doe not affect your melatonin production so it woninterfere with your sleep cycle i used to use a tablet but it wa too bright and bulky
serf my daily need for email local newspaper and favorite apps like pinterest instructibles ebay youtube facebook etc easy to use nvenient size weight great quality screen resolution and sound
my year old nephew said that this wa his favorite christmas gift that is all i needed to hear to remmend this to friend
amazon echo black ha me a long way from it root a an online bookseller looking to branch into the internet of thing the mpany released the echo an internet connected speaker that act a a personal assistant
i love it i enjoy playing game and reading on it
mpared to previous generation kindle this one is much user friendly and overall a good ereader
i love the fire i can carry it in my purse plus i can read it anywhere i took it on my cruise and every chance i had i laid out on the deck and read book on it it wa a great buy
the tap is portable ha excellent sound quality and is a good value for the money
so if purchasing three more of these after the initial one doe not say get one i do not know what else to say rated a not because of sketchy voice regnition sometimes
great tablet for the price if you are a user of amazon is service play movie video music from amazon is prime service great if you do not use these it is an ok android tablet doe not support the google play store directly but can be sideloaded not a great experience tho
kindle oasis is very light with gb of memory no need for wifi to read
best purchase i have made when it me to item for reading battery last for day and week the lighting source is awesome and adjustable i remmend this to everyone who want to have a book on the go but not carry anything too heavy
we returned this item after week it took a lot of repeated request to get it to listen to u and it just wa not a easy to use a i thought it would be
this kindle is great and easy for me to read book that i wanted to do a long time
got this for on black friday even if i paid full price i d be more than happy with it nice and portable and doe everything you ll need
i had a hard time finding a case for it at best buy
this ha worked flawlessly since i bought it a few month ago easy to use nice apps used primarily for playstation vue tv
there are some thing i cannot download but good
excellent product smooth flowing lot of great free and paid apps
ouch i bought this fire tablet and used it for about four hour and left it on a charger a uple of hour later i picked up the tablet and the screen wa showing a weird ghosting effect and then the screen went mpletely black i twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get thing working again just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet i m sure i had a defective damaged tablet but i wa underwhelmed with the quality and it would be nice if amazon brought back the higher quality hdx tablet for people who do not mind paying more for quality tablet
this is my send amazon echo that i m adding to another level of our house and i uld not be happier with these device from ntrolling music light thermostat and the list go on and on life with alexa and an amazon echo is much better
i bought this new paperwhite after using the regular kindle for a long time i am amazed by the light weight and the ease of use the battery make a huge difference a well love it
it is nice but i need to learn more about it because it doe not do everything i ask of it i d still buy it again though
it matter what preference you prefer with tablet i mean if you use window or google more this might not be for you for me i use amazon music video book and shopping so this tablet is awesome it is made especially for amazon esystem user it light and ha a nice feel i live the blue shade option it ha for le blue light when reading
awesome product if you enjoy reading this is a must have
if you know the workarounds of the amazon kindle environment this tablet is a good choice cheap lightweight and the expandable memory are the best feature
if you re deciding between the amazon echo and the google home then fork up the extra sts and get the echo it hand down better it been around longer so it ha more experience and technology mpatability you will not be disappointed
have both the stick and now the fire tv wish i would have bought this from the get go worth the extra money

kindle is good a long a it is plugged into a wall outlet the battery last a mere minute a a portable unit not happy with this take an hour to charge the battery to yet drain in minute there is something mathematically wrong with this equation
echo will read a book play music tell me a joke and work remotely to turn on a light at home while i m out of the house
great piece of technology wish i would have found this sooner
incredible value for the money so many feature for so little money
with a job on the cutting edge of tech stuff i wanted to experience the echo and alexa oddly my wife who is not tech focused love talking to alexa to get her favorite radio station or music to play right now it is a novelty unnecessary but fun a we increase our smart home i think the echo will be the center of it
this tablet overall is okay there are few problem that i face with this tablet charging this tablet take little longer than the average tabletsome of the application is not available through amazon store app
christmas present for the spouse which she asked for happy wife equal happy life
i enjoyed the way the fire transfered all of my book game and apps it only took a little bit of time to go through the start up the fire start up quick and i love the larger screen for reading my book the lors are brilliant
product work a expected easy to set up and easy to use love it
i am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in year because that is the average life of kindle this is my they get slow froze and die after year moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version here are the noticeable change speed this version is snappy the new ui take a little time to get used to the led lighting is even no more ghost at the bottom of the page cloud storage book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading just like any other kindle set up is easy downloading over title of book to the device is fast i do average book a year with the kindle of urse no worry on where to store them although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lot of book one mplaint that i have is the usb cable is too short
my daughter love her tablet she got it for christmas and ha lot of fun with her own game
really ol tech i like the versatility of this item i would remmend to everyone
i wanted the technology but didnwant something that listens to the ever present nversation in my home the amazon tap fit the bill since one must tap it button to get it to listen it work and work very well
lot of ad from amazon other than that good for light use
the kindle is a good tablet and would remmend to others
this e reader is amazing it is so light and easy to read with one hand the screen is great and the battery last for week
wa not sure about an e reader this thing is great battery life is good i m getting about a week or more before charging with reading about an hr a day

i own the original kindle reader it had several quirk that have been fixed page turn easier almost all function are faster and lighted page are much easier to read in low light the only negative so far is the shorter battery life
my son enjoys this tablet it work well but for his next one we will get a larger screen size overall great value and well worth the price
this is my send firetv that i purchased it is very user friendly with plenty of apps i use about on a regular basis and the streaming is fantastic with the extra ram little to no buffering highly remmended

it doe what it is supposed to do very minimal freezing send or two on occasion
my wife and i actually bought two of these for our two younger child i love that they give u ntrol over how much screen time they get when they re available to be turned on and when they turn off a well a when they can play the game after their reading time just awesome
i bought this to replace a dedicated kid tablet another brand that had wonderful software but not a replaceable battery barely got a year and a half out of the other brand the price difference between this and the dedicated kid version wa largely a software suite subscription so i bought this along with her mom we found free and age appropriate software i loaded up a micro sd card with music and audio story both grand daughter love it a they are and i bought the bumper to help protect it it is not in the same league a my samsung tablet but for it st or the st of the dedicated kid brand it is great
for the money you just cannot beat this little tablet i have used it quite heavily i used it during a trip i took and had to rely on it while my mputer wa in the shop for over a week and it ha performed beautifully i would remmend this product to anyone

i decided i wanted to try a tablet for reading book and a little social medium instead of using my phone all the time i researched the fire and fire hd and settled on the knowing that it is a low end device the device is slick and easy to use and the alexa integration is really ol but it is a tablet at time the performance is awful slow i suspect it is updating ntent say on twitter or fb my mplaint is when it is doing this there are no visuals to let you know it is busy i finally got on amazon is chat feature and several hour later including several power cycle and a mplete factory restore the performance is the same the rep at amazon tried their best and fwiw i knew there wa nothing they uld do to speed it up before i contacted them but i thought i would give it a try so get this if you want just be patient remember it is a tablet if you want better performance spend more

pricey yes for serious reader and user of library e book mpletly worth it while nothing beat a real book experience traveling day plus per week nothing beat the portability and ability to add from the library or amazon on the fly never have to seek out light to read by a noticeable improvement in the backlight exceptional direct sun readability not affected by polarized sunglass great battery life great build quality i expect it to last a long time only upgraded a i lost my last kindle on the train

i like the echo and it is really handy it is a little creepy that it listens to every word uttered but there are some handy thing that you can get out of this appliance

the echo is the current standard in the marketplace and with good reason it is easy to set up and use and mpatible with an ever expanding list of product
great product like just a much a the fire stick great
gift wa on point recipient wa very pleased would remmend to others
thought of being able to have the echo grow a i added to the list of task excited me including the latest app having it to regnize my smartphone is contact list to place and to receive call however the echo i purchased doe not link up to my samsung smartphone disappointed is a understatement
we use the amazon echo for everything from news update to the weather report to playing our favorite music to ntroling light in our home no mplaints love it

i have had a kindle for a long time i chose to upgrade to the paperwhite i am very happy with my decision
bigger screen longer battery life and faster loading an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet a a llege student it beat spending more on book and having to lug the extra weight on my back

love it great price great feature easy to set up and can just use double side tape to hide right behind tv
for the price quality this produce is great for gift or for the person that like to read on the go
amazon already includes this cable with the kindle fire the kindle fire hd and the kindle fire hd it is also great to purchase a a back up for the office or to take with you on the go for the peace of mind knowing amazon designed this to work specifically with kindle fire it is worth the price the quality of this cable mpared to the previous white usb cable is much better this cable ha a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better data transfer speed between the mputer and the device are relatively quick this cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be ft in length measuring both cable the black cable is approx ft and the white cable is approx ft in overall even though it is shorter this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable

this is a great reader it feel like the best evolution of the paperwhite the auto brightness work fine and is unnoticeable and it feel good in the hand the new page squeeze feature is nice a is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel the power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen make swiping and tapping the bookmark and location rner area much easier the backlight is now much more uniform than my st gen paperwhite the only issue i have is when displaying black block like the tree silhouette i have what look like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkle and of urse this thing is expensive when mpared to the paperwhite
for the price you have to deal with a lot of pre loaded stuff but it is a great price for a capable tablet
excellent tablet for beginner and kid the camera and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price it not for everyone you get what you pay for
this tablet doe everything the ipad mini can do except that it is cheaper than the ipad
bought this for my father who never did much on mputers and wa not sure he would actually use this he unwrapped it asked for some game to be downloaded and ha not looked back he ha used the internet a well a the game apps and uld not be happier
i m not a huge fan of the modified android interface on this tablet and it is far from the best tablet on the market not even close but i am giving it star based on it value it is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera and a microsd slot for cheap easy expandable storage throw in the excellent integration with the amazon esystem if you use that and you have a very worthwhile device if you are not a big amazon user i do not think it ha a much to offer but it is still nice for an ultra low budget tablet
ha been on my granddaughter kindle for many month and still working great
i looked all over for a tablet and best buy had only two left so i knew it wa meant to be
very easy to use and it is everything that i wanted and thought it would be

all the important apps are loaded on this hdmi device i can even side load other apps and game that are not already installed on it nice basic slim remote ntrol that is not loaded with a lot of ntrol button easy to operate the remote is also voice activated i use this feature for checking weather i use this device for watching live tv from playstation vue much cheaper than cable or satellite tv i like the fire tv box much better than the fire tv stick it is more stable and stronger ha quad re processor the stick is dual re if you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay i kept experiencing buffering issue with the stick the fire tv box ha an ethernet port mini sd slot and usb port the stick doe not you will need to setup an amazon acunt to use the device but you do not have to put credit card information on it if you do not want to i didngive it star because it is extremely difficult to put battery in the remote ntrol very difficult to open it despite that imo it is worth the extra st
perfect for a kid and it wa cheap my son ha broke a lot of tablet this one seems durable
voyager is super easy to use and see love the translation too
i set it up but have not used it yet not clear how to download book but i plan to learn that this weekend
the fire tablet is a great tool for reading surfing the web playing game and even watching some netflix on a bigger screen without killing a cell phone charge
wa in special easy to get it online and pick up in the store nice service and the personal very gentle
i mean it is a great product for what you get little on the expensive side
i bought on sale for my sister remmended kindle tablet because of the text to speech feature some kindle ebooks have a text to speech feature you can start reading at home then turn on text to speech fir when you are in the car stuck in traffic we have a prime membership and you can save amazon video to watch offline i have not tried this yet but sound great for plane or bus travel you camn download the overdrive app directly for free book audio book and video i plan to download the nook app so i can read overdrive magazine and my nook book micro sd slot for additional storage only mono sound which is fine for what i want to use it for cheap enough that i ll let the grandkids use it
this product wa easy to set up and to use work great and ha expandable storage which is nice
i love that the kid can only do what you allow them to they cannot get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i do not because i have a four and year old there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well also these tablet double and can b used a a regular tablet for grown ups
i bought this tablet because it had high review and wa at a great price for a first tablet
the fire is a good product for it price we bought it for travel and it worked like we wanted it to the volume wa lacking though trying to listen to a movie an the plane wa very difficult
amazon should include this charger with the kindle the fact that they re charging u extra for something that should be included is a sign of cheapness plus you can use any micro usb phone charger instead of this to charge your kindle save your money
i got this to go along with the vizio p c i bought the vizio is a great display but with no internal tuner it must be connected to cable or a streaming casting source for programing the fire tv make it easy to connect to netflix and hulu among many other program source but it is especially great if you re a prime member giving you access to prime video both free and purchased the only think i d change is if it uld receive hdr program movie amazon video doe have hdr programming available for a growing amount of it ntent but this version of fire tv doe not if you do not have a uhd tv fire tv is about perfect
this is my rd kindle need i say more i have not been disappointed with this product and the value of the product is better each time i purchase it
cannot beat the price on this tablet great for streaming or casual game
purchased the amazon echo for my son birthday and he love it

my daughter ha had this tablet for almost month and it work well
i upgraded my kindle to the kindle voyage because i read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake i thought i would be able to use this kindle without the lamp but for me it is hard to read with the room mpletely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable i still use the kindle with the lamp on but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room i bought the magnetic case so when i open the lid the kindle wake up it is a little smaller than my old kindle and fit in my purse perfectly all in all i love it and would highly remmend it
everything and more that i imagined love love love my echo
the kid love it they ask it silly question which to my amazement it ha an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it find it

my son enjoys being on his tablet and getting on all the apps he ha it keep him entertained he love it
excellent screen the small change to the form make a huge different i adore the flatness so much and the brightness is a perfect for daylight imo worth the st
a great deal for a good product very mpact yet easy to view screen and user friendly
we have bought two now and this version is a little lighter w larger screen and just like our first one really simple to use we call them our tablet they re super afordable and worth the our first one wa double the price so uld not pa up this deal it still work great and ha been dropped many time by my toddler ha all the same feature a the child version i think great product
device is user friendly very easy to navigate and much faster than the firestick can also install kodi unlike other streaming device
it is a good little tablet i do not know if i would get this a my personal main tablet but the whole idea wa for my son he is loving it
bought this a a gift for my dad he love it still working on setting up a music subscription to allow more play time
easy to use like lighted screen for reading in dark
i bought this because it ha more storage space it is easy to set up i like the sd card option to expand the storage and it ha a usb port so if i wanted to i uld add an external hard drive
i bought this one a a gift but i do have a uple i keep for the child to play learning game on they re awesome
this ha to be one of the best deal around the screen resolution is good the speed is adequate and it is versatile a a reader game device or internet tablet
price wa just right i would remmend to someone
i use this tablet for my daughter and i uld only download youtube kid wished i would have purchased the one with more storage
we enjoy looking at movie and other show on our new toy
we bought this tablet for our son and there were a lot of free downloadable educational game and apps amazon also gave u to purchase apps and ebooks
i would remmend the kindle paper white to anyone
the tablet is great overall it fast smooth and many option to check out with regard to apps and program great also if you have an amazon acunt and also kindle a well
this tablet nked out on me the first day i powered it on the amazon symbol came up and never went past that screen i wa highly annoyed because i purchased it a a first to send it out of the untry my biggest mistake wa trusting that everything would work fine instead i should have powered on the device to ensure everything wa fine
this is an amazing product got it for my dorm and i love it
greater good ok nice ok enough done go get it
really nice and easy to use it is my first tablet and i love it
this is the best little affordable android device around uld use more memory but love what it can do the regular amazon apps are just the beginning ton more you can do with it if you know what you re doing
extremely easy to use and to purchase the touch screen work well and the auto on off is very helpful love the ability to just close and system is off and not using battery
by far my favorite product to stream from i purchased the stick afterwards but it is no where near a reliable a the tv

christmas gift for granddaughter they loved there first one time for a update
bought this to use to read my textbook on trip when i didnwant to carry my laptop fit what i needed perfectly lightweight and the battery is lasting a long time easy to set up
it wa too slow he didnput any attention to it battery didnlast
the kindle wa purchased for my daughter she love it she play game on it everyday
the echo overall work good still need an update for voice renitiona and giving direction
this gift wa a stocking stuffer for the price i paid wonderful the recipient loved it
i like this one because it ha vocabulary list you can save new word in vocabulary list and review them until you master new word
i thought this would have a better sound than the google home assistant based on price more when not on sale and description of speaker ran the two side by side and i thought the google home had a better sound neither one is a main speaker in my room but sometimes it is easier to just ask them to play a station on pandora or radio than going to the main sound system a for what alexa can and cannot do that is tough to say since we do not have any smart device in the house at that moment it work well for quick weather news and traffic report but not so good for a free form question google wa more intuitive and better at understanding the question with alexa if you have not downloaded the skill then there is a chance that she wonunderstand still she is very good at keeping track of shopping list and at some point i will add smart light thermostat garage door opener etc to the house so hopefully the nvenience will make thing better
got this tablet a a gift for my mom who is and is a little not used to high technology so she u this tablet mostly for facebook and reading an e book work fine but if you are an user that like high resolution screen plenty of storage and fast processor this is not your choice good streaming can be done though
i enjoy having this smaller tablet to carry around
large display make it easy to use very easy to use
best buy make it easy no problem i am a best buy geek
play great music and hears you from pretty far away simple to set up and make life a bit easier new skill being added keep it new and exciting

great product i bought very fast hardly no lag
it is hard to beat this box it is fast ha hardware acceleration for h and h up to k video so it doe not stutter even with the highest quality video android based o easily sideloads apps like kodi spmc and firefox browser the remote is mfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current apple tv th gen remote having a microsdhc slot make up for the dismal gb of internal storage usb slot make use of a standard wireless keyboard easy i wish the homepage wa more organized customizeable like the appletv but the apps and hardware itself is every bit a good imo
great for my little kid to play and be occupy while i ok
my son love it this is his st tablet he u this for his reading assignment and research too
for the money nice tablet perfect fo my seven year old granddaughter
i just wish it had an optical audio out like the previous model so that is why it loses a star but in general it is a ol device to stream movie etc
it is slick and a little hard to hold otherwise it is great
good for the price amazon apps are not much the big thing amazon doe not let you use google play for apps
i do not have a connected home but the echo is fun to use more skill are added by amazon each week the accuracy of the echo understanding my voice mmands are excellent unfortunately only the dot can stream via bluetooth i would give the dot a look when it begin to be generally available

this is a great personal speaker i have both the tap and the echo the only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically tap the mic button to activate alexa the sound quality is pretty good for the price if you can afford it i would upgrade to the echo

alexa is a lot of fun to have in the kitchen it is a great device to connect to the latest news or ingredient for a recipe highly remmend

i bought this tablet for my almost yr old we didnwant to splurge on an ipad and this wa a great price we love to read book on it and watch movie in the car
not much new to be said beautiful screen long battery life great to own if you love to read
i bought this tablet for my grand daughter she love it her parent and i love the fact that she u it to read book perfect
great tablet for the price perfect for my son
this is an excellent price for the amazon fire tab i highly remmend to product
work great imo altho when i first got it home the remote didnwork and appeared rroded insidewe called the store and they said i had to call some part store which said they were out of remoteskind of a run around imo i got the remote fixed myself other than that the box work grest
i love this device it work so well and is easy on the eye having on device hold all of my book and being able to get new book so easily is the best feature for someone like me who is an avid reader
just the right size for reading book and playing some game
we are glad we bought this great for movie and everyday game
though not super noticible the resolution is better on the voyage also the fact that the screen doe not dip in and is flat all the way across wa a huge plus for me having a toddler that spill stuff on it if i leave it lying around the page turn button feature on the side are kinda pointless though all in all love it
had a prob with original one i purchased and bedt buy replaced it hassle free
grateful i have the hottest item of the year and it work great thank you best buy
decent product it is definitely not for anyone who want a tablet to stream or play game other than amazon prime and laggy game but it is ok for internet browsing and general use it is on the lowest end of the tablet price so you get what you pay for
but this is not a bad substitute the print and light are easily adjustable it is small and lightweight easy to carry and hold a charge for a week or so at the font size i use it take to kindle page turn to equal page turn of a book and thus i think i would prefer a larger screen although it is touted a better for the eye than reading using the kindle app on a tablet i really do not think that is the case for me for me a tablet is just a usable although heavier and le nvenient overall for the price the pro outweigh the n and i would remmend it
my wife thought tablet wa to bright this more like reading book keep charge alot longer and work with amazon prime so this very good purchase at very good price
my kid play game and watch video perfect fast enough for what we need
awesome for the kid and a great price doe the same a an expensive one
great value for the price grabbed of these for the kiddos they are capable of playing game and with the know how you can put google play store on them
had about month very slow started out good but ha been getting slower cleared everything still not good
excellent product can get some apps that the fire stick and roku can not of urse this is a small screen but offer more flexibility than just streaming it a mputer kindle and mobile device all in one
gave a a gift to my wife she love the size good battery life now need to find a ver for it
i purchased this for my wife after she had seen one at a friend house she love it it stay in the kitchen and she listens to music set oking timer get weather report and overall just enjoys it it work flawlessly and is great entertainment for our grandson too i would remmend this to anyone
great product easy to use love the lighted pad ease of down loading book
easy to operate and very handy and good for the price
i like this product still getting to learn how to use it
tried different charging block nothing worked properly plugged in the amazon block kindle came right up
alexa is great however since we have a uple lamp hooked up through vivint we ask her to turn them on and off no matter how clearly or different way we say it she often get nfused a to which lamp to turn on off or anything at all
it came with dead pixel so i wa very disappointed i called then they replaced it i ended up returning it mpletely because it wa too slow
this wa a perfect fit for my in law their lack of knowledge with tech made this the perfect gift
i am very happy with my purchase the echo ha been used every day since it ha been in my home
there is no doubt this is the best available e reader in the market i wa struggling with tablet v reader but eventually ended up with reader a it give the best reading experience
love that i can request any music i want to hear
bought it for my nephew for xmas we shall see how it hold up for him
yes the kindle is pretty nice the battery last a very long time and the letter are clear

bought one for my son a while back now got one for my daughter great tablet for whole family at a great price
i bought this tablet for my kid to watch video and use mostly educational game on it and they love it
apple tv is going to do better than it currently is to keep up with amazon fire so much more freedom with this little black box
i bought this for a christmas gift they love it very happy with purchase
just the right size for reading backlight great for low light reading or no light quick book downloads kindle lending library is also ol if you re a prime member you can also e mail yourself a pdf to the device which is sent to an email assigned to the same
slower that my ipad love it cheaper and better than my kindle paperwhite with much more storage also bought micro sd card prime member and use it to download free with prime movie
i have purchased of these for my kid the last few year while they are playing a tablet or two i keep the other tablet charged i have enjoyed using them myself
small unit provides excellent quality and portability is a huge plus
best product ever my kid love them dearly
the kindle fire hd is a wonderful tool a well a a device for entertainment the beauty of the kindle fire is the price i look forward to buying updated device
this is my third kindle but first paper white this is by far my favorite i took it to the beach and uld read perfectly in the glaring sunlight i can also use it at night when my husband is asleep and the room is dark lightwieght and easy to tuck away in my purse love it
this is my send kindle the improvement over the older generation kindles is huge this kindle is thin and light i put it in my pocketbook and take it all over the backlight is handy when needed the screen clarity is excellent great device
great for listening to prime music quick weather report volume adjusts quickly and give status of battery on request
much better than the fire stick faster more memory never lag
over all the product is good and work a advertised but lately it is nstantly having issue keeping enet connection and even worse ha issue updating we were told this is a larger amazon network issue
got this on black friday for bought it for my wife and she love it for web surfing
a bit pricey but worth the money in my opinion perfect size and great screen
i purchased this tablet to leave in the kitchen to use for pinterest recipe it is perfect for that and small enough to easily tuck away in a cabinet when not in use
product work well but ha more potential than is currently offered a bit difficult to set up on household sharing a prime membership lack flexibility with your i tune library unless you want to pay amazon to access the song you already own hopefully amazon will get smarter highly remmend the product
i have bought over replacement charging wire the one with the micro mail end that insert into the fire to charge it after one or two u the wire beme loose and fall out they definitely wonstay put to charge doe anyone else have this problem what is the solution if not for this i would remmend it

the purchase wa primarily for my husband who is technology challenged he can now listen to the music he want when he want he is still experimenting with asking question you do have to be careful when talking about alexa because she will respond to your nversation
it is fast mpared to the firestick the only issue i see is the remote bemes unresponsive sometimes
great entertainment devicegood brand quality and price
everyone should have one because it ha so many great feature listen to music ntrol home security find out what the weather is and all by just asking

bought it for my student to use it is not a great resolution but it is great for reading book
i didntake the time to read the review on this a i actually went to the store to buy a fire stick the salesman talked me into the fire tv instead supposedly because of higher picture quality i have not noticed any difference for an average user maybe the stick is just fine and you save money

this is a fun tool to have for the family it doe make easier to have prime on amazon to listen to music

this tablet ha proven to be a great durable device for the grand kid using them for game and book for school work
i would have given this star but the touch response is not always responsive sometimes it act like it is frozen and then it turn the page after several sends i like the new feature over the paper white a well i love you do not have to pick up your finger to turn the page
i love this product it is simply amazing i ha so many option for adding game and apps
i read a lot enjoy this product while reading before bedtime
who is an ï fanboy and now he will more than likely trash this when the homepod arrives yay ï
should be included with the kindle
bought the tablet for my kid the tablet is not really friendly for them the home page try to take you to amazon stuff only and when they download game it is kind of hard to find them battery life cannot hold up to a yr old he run it dead quicker then it can charge
i got this item a a gift for a worker and she really seemed to like it the price is very fair mpared to other tablet
easy to start using and a fun approach to choosing the right program to watch i am enjoying sharing with friend

it is a must buy for the money you cannot beat it at all
this is the best tablet i have ever purchased very easy to operate

bought this for my husband for valentine is day we have the philip hue bulb which this syncs with which is really nice love that you can ask it question how is the traffic to work etc
i m currently living in korea and needed americannotelevision to keep me entertained i had kodi installed on a firestick however despite having a mbps service plan my wireless connection uld not keep up with the bandwidth hungry programming my solution wa to purchase the firetv and hardwire my internet connection via ethernet the difference wa immediately noticeable i have not had any buffering issue and program load up immediately i would definitely remmend this device if you live in an apartment where the air is saturated with wifi signal and plan on using bandwidth heavy application such a kodi the ethernet connection ensures that you are getting a clean signal and using the maximum bandwidth speed of your isp
great product work well with all my smart device
loud enough for small gathering very responsive to mmands
this tablet doe everything it said it would work great
i cut off my cable and went for the streaming box finally have been happy with my purchase no regret

i love the picture quality sometimes losing internet connection i wish it ha time warner app
good tablet for cheap ha a lot of function that are useful
great battery life very easy to read in all light lot of free book also
turned older tv into a smart tv i wish a hdmi cable would of came with fire stick a it doe the cheaper fire stick
very handy to buy parent or grandparent with reading the number of choice on one tablet instead of carry book if you are out of state trip like plane
great tablet which let you hook into the ntent of the amazon esystem easily
great tablet for the price it wa on sale for i wa surprised by it quickness
got this a a gift for my wife after she just about wore out her old kindle she only want it to read so it didnmake sense to get the other version this one doe exactly what she want and she can use it to read anywhere indoors or outside
it did some thing really well like setting alarm and playing music but there were too many time i would ask alexa a question and she would respond saying she didnknow i ended up returning it great promise i just do not know that it is there yet
it is fast n i love the expandable memory slot i love how my tv remote can ntrol it also deff worth buying
like that fact i can read my book and play some apps
alexa is now part of the family we have integrated her with our smart thing hub and along with apps like ifttt she work great
pro a beefy machine for the price great battery management in standby a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price n proprietory amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference the app selection is limiting but you can install google play and get all you need from there brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but mpletely usable a mpromise for the low price had some wi fi issue on several occasion mpatibility issue it is a little weak also may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird long an narrow overall a reasonable tab that doe the job done not many game though for a minimal investment
the amazon echo revolutionized my home i connected to my spotify my phillips hue and everything else it is a gem of an idea to make voice ntrol work your whole home the only thing i would say is that it should me with the voice ntrol remote once i got it a a separate purchase it mpleted the outstanding experience i so desperately desired i will tell you that if you do not have the echo shame on you this is the future and it is here now i love it
the new kindle ha so many great feature and is an excellent upgrade over the previous version i love the ease in using it and it is so mpact and light i take it every where a perfect christmas gift and great value for the price
i ordered the echo based upon online review and based on suggestion of friend however thus far the only thing i ever use it for is to play music which i uld easily do with my other electronics i am holding out hope that future update make this more of a must have item

having a charger for my kindle paperwhite make certain that i am charging the kindle with the proper charging power

i love it i also have a fire stick i got the firetv box thinking if i need to run ethernet i can but i have had no reason to processor is great
i bought this tablet for my daughter who wa turning but also because we were taking an hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied the game are very toddler user friendly and when she get mad and throw it it doe not effect the tablet my only issue is that the charger doe not stay secure in the charger spot sorry i do not know the technical term haha so sometimes i will think it is charging and in fact it is not i remmend buying the warranty for issue like that

i got this around the holiday and i m happy with the quality of the image and video you may be just fine with not having a amazon prime membership and just use it for light web browsing the screen get easily smudged but for the price it is a great value
if you want to have multiple apps this is what to get
not a easy a it sounded like it wa going to be so many thing to buy to get full use out of what we knew we uld do every question we seem to ask alexa she say she doe not know the answer and that we d have to download the app so we never use her only to ask her to set a timer and tell u the time and ask her to play music which we also had to set up first not a neat a we thought she wa going to be
my kid like it and the application is amazing i remmend it for all kid

my year old granddaughter love her new tablet she u it to play game and download movie
the echo is a great product it wa easy to set up and alexa wa answering question in no time there are several basic function that the echo is wonderful at news weather music time and timing i love playing the jeopardy game i think that if i have anything to say on the down side it is that i had a higher expectation of the product is ability to search the internet for answer to some of my question lot of my inquiry me back with the answer i did not understand that question or i m sorry i do not know the answer these are only a minor irritation amusement overall i am pleased with the product hopefully i will grow in my knowledge of the product and echo will also grow in ability through upgrade

what can i say this is a great device that make many home task easier and more fun
i picked up a regular kindle touch a few month ago thinking i d be fine with it lately my schedule is only allowing me to read in the evening when it already darker out and i do not like having to keep all the light on to read decided to pull the trigger on one of these paperwhites and yep wish i d gone this route to begin with the increased pixel unt plus the built in light make this thing a joy over the regular kindle make it a lot easier on my eye and for that alone i remmend it
i still have not used the camera once i figure it out i will use it i love the feature on it i use it for facebook mostly email i also play some of the game on facebook
bought it a a xmas gift for my daughter who doe not read too much and now with the purchase of amazon kindle she is reading more plus she get to play android game
snappy and reliable performance this is exactly what i expected it little brother to be work great with our system we generally use our echo a the speaker and they work well together my only real mplaint is the lack of certain apps vudu in particular but i cannot blame that on the device or it manufacturer that fall to the app developer
a great nvience for a busy person when needing info and organization help
pro light mpact bright fast response from touch screenns hard to navigate i use my old kindle with button to browse this kindle can be frustratingwith it overly sensitive touch screen overall a very good reader but no need to purchase if happy with paperwhite version for someone new to kindle it is worth the price a long a have another electronic device to browse the kindle site
i would not remmend it a a primary tablet but it ok for reading and simple game
i have bought several kindles for my grandkids they all enjoy them we use it for the library and download into overdrive and there are so many free game kid love this
love it work better than anticipated also at a good price
didnreally need this but it came in a kit with my kindle can never have too many
it is nice not to have to pay for tv and have so many more choice
nsidering this wa under fifty dollar i am satisfied with it
got it for my daighter and it a great tablet for a starter easy to ise and ha great graphic
got an unbelievable deal the best part is having a library of book at my fingertip easy and simple to set up and great when i m traveling
i love the functionality of this amazon tablet bought one for me and one for the hubby daughter is the next one to get one
the tablet work great so far the parent feature are nice also
the product is good for child the downside is the tablet is charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use if you plan on giving this to a child make sure you take care of charging it for them dont let them do it on their own or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker a they are a bit careless
the echo work well i have only gotten into the beginning of issuing it and it help me a lot
great handheld device for starter and easy to handle
i bought the amazon tap when it wa on sale i already had the amazon echo and the dot the tap wa a pleasant surprise speaker are not a strong a the original echo but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable thetap will do virtually anything that the more expensive echo can do including hand free voice mmands plus it is portable and ha a wireless charger base so that it stay charged it is easy to set up if you follow the instruction carefully it pair with your home wifi network and can also act a a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source
so helpful to power up our reader anywhere
is great for beginner i love the parental ntrol on it it work great for my toddler
best electronic item in house great purchase good
it is a nice gadget sometimes though it cannot understand what i m wanting her to do but the more you use it the better it get
great speaker but u have to have amazon prime to hear song random wa unaware so i gave star that reason over all great sound
another good buy for my daughter youngest one too she enjoys being on it
this is great for using voice ntrol around the house
i have had several kindle ereaders over the year also nook kobo and sony a well i even had the original rocket reader i still have it and they have all improved over the year so it is not surprising that the new voyage is the best one yet over all i prefer the kindle reader now and amazon ha perfected the ebook experience so why go anywhere else
these two boy were thrilled with the fire tablet every time i see them they are glued to the tablet they both have said it is the best present ever extra point to the grandfather on these gift

i previously owned the larger hd fire kindle and loved it i wanted a smaller tablet to fit in my purse so this wa perfect i love the lor it hold a ton of book and you can add a sd card for extra space
it is an ok tablet because you need to have an amazon acunt in order to download free apps

not just for the kid for the tablet challenged me i find it easy to work with
bought this kindle mainly for my kid there are plenty of game that my kid and i enjoy playing having the expandable memory slot wa one of the reason i purchased this model happy with my purchase we have three of this model
easy to use plenty to watch easy enough to set up
amazon ha the right idea with building an affordable yet quality tablet that provides wonderful access to prime ntent
good cable for iphone this original oem apple usb lightning cable for iphone this usb cable connects your iphone ipad or ipod with lightning connector to your mputer is usb port for syncing and charging or to the apple usb power adapter for nvenient charging from a wall outlet m long
we have enjoyed using the amazon fire tv it is similar to apple tv and roku but nice if you have a k tv and amazon prime
happy with purchase would remmend always happy
i just purchased it yesterday and am no expert by far but setup wa a breeze i also took it to the beach today and found that it wa like reading a piece of paper amazing
the amazon fire tv is the better medium streamer for this price fast processing and great image resolution when used a a open source medium player highly remmend
purchased for my husband kindle he love the way the built in stand work

you cannot beat the price on this tablet but there is no bluetooth also it really hit you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon we bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital okbooks
it work well it take time for it to know your vocabulary
bought it for my mother relatively user friendly for someone not too familiar with smart phone and such she seems to like it although she mplains about the speed and size of the screen at time she also like the size though since it can easily fit in a medium to large purse the touch screen is responsive and it ha the essential that she need it feel and look nice the app store is ok for simple use it is a great price for a simple beginner or kid tablet i would probably purchase something more powerful for my own use
my wife ha used a kindle fire for year now and it wa time to upgrade her this device went on sale right before mother is day and i knew it wa time to upgrade her year old device i picked a lor and ordered and delivery to the store and pickup wa just in time for the weekend overall great product and great service from best buy for getting it to me in time

the amazon tv work great fast loading and no buffering work awesome with the kodi app
this kindle is the lightest one yet easy to operate and great to carry on plane
great for kid easy to use great game to download
love my kindle highly remmended to anyone that read regularly or travel we use it for reading on the go and even to access netflix and email on a device larger than a cell phone but smaller than a mputer
the amazon echo is very helpful and just plain fun i use it primarily for weather music on pandora ask simple question there is so much more you can do with this but i have only scratched the surface it wa very easy to install connect to my home wi fi no issue here the music audio quality is fine for a small device it hears me very well even from the other room i would have given it star if it wa able to answer more difficult different question using it internet search
it doe everything i need it to do but the battery life is short lived i bought it with the intention to keep my toddler entertained the battery last about hour if it run ntinuously if it is intermittent use it last about hour worth it for the price
needed something a bit larger than the to stream netflix this wa perfect
it take a little getting used to if you are used to android
my daughter love it she is a little rough with and throw it sometimes but it is still good i did have a soft case on it though
i got this for a christmas present for my son but uld not help myself it is awesome look like momma is rewrapping for him or buying another d
i love this the sound is so good i like it better than the small one and alexa can hear me even im far it wa an amazing product and i got good deal of urse fr best buy
i picked this up oma deal of the day took a little learning but man is this thing great for travel doe backlight reading and play my digital movie great all around tablet
this wa a gift for my son and he love it it not only help him with his homework but he uld also play game on it
i have had a kindle keyboard g for year but picked this up for the backlight feature it is just a good a expected from a kindle device and i do not miss the physical keyboard at all
this is a great tablet i have the kindle fire hd or something like that and i got this for my grand daughter she love it i hate that she is only yr old and i have to add her tablet to my amazon acunt on my tablet cause she doe not have an email cause you have to set up an acunt with email
these day amazon doe not supply a charger when you purchase a new kindle that make sense because most kindle purchaser probably have older kindle model already or other usb powered device or phone or tablet many of which will have included charger a a result most people will already have a sufficient supply of charger sitting around but for someone who want or need a new charger when they order a new kindle amazon present you with the option to buy one at the time of your kindle purchase so i wa surprised when i noticed this new charger model now being offered a an option for new kindles my first thought wa that amazon had updated their previous charger model to bring them up to date and make them mpetitive with the great variety of third party charger now available see link below for these earlier model a soon a i looked at the spec for this charger though i wa disappointed unfortunately even though this is amazon is latest basic charger offering it is not in my opinion the best choice for someone who need a usb charger for a kindle or for anything else for that matter and that is something i would not usually find myself saying because usually amazon is accessory are reasonably priced and mpetitive this is certainly a capable and functional charger and it will work perfectly fine with any kindle device and charge it acceptably well but here are the reason why i feel this is not the best choice it will supply only a output maximum that is sufficient for a kindle e reader but not sufficient for many other device any of the fire device for example will benefit from a higher output charger in order to reduce charging time read more
this little thing doe everything and doe it quickly it uld use a case so think about getting one but a an ereader it doe everything it is supposed to
alexa is revolutionary she doe so many thing no reason to be jealous bring her home invite her in
my daughter love this there are so many setting and you do not have to buy every app individual so many book and educational apps
uld not say more great thing about this product do yourself a favor and get this it is so fast and while it ha the same functionality a the firesticks which i also own you can hook this up directly to your internet router which make streaming extremely fast make sure you watch plenty of youtube video and anyone can figure out how to get the most out of all of the service fire tv the world wide web and kodi youtube this ha to offer
easy to operate easy to download book size is great for carrying in a purse lor is really good very happy with this product
i wa looking for a tablet for my niece and i got it for no other deal can beat this

alexa ha a hard time answering you need to download information online in order to build her data base
it is ok for the average user but it o not good enough for kodi the interface is ok but a little too busy for me i did not like the fact that i uld not use my universal harmony remote with it jodi also take almost an hour to set up and it buffer way more than on the shield
very nice table for a very good price very good for reading browsing and basic function a little slow overall and i also miss some better feature related to the different profile we can create for example we can create different profile for kid but cannot put a password to each one of them at least i didnfind how to do it

this little set top box pack a big punch it is an absolute must for any medium center the processor is very fast mpared to it unter part the fire tv stick no buffering issue and an expandable memory slot you can also use wireless keyboard and a mouse to alleviate those remote click when searching for something the voice activated remote is a beauty just say anything you want to it and it will look it up for you within the amazon apps this is a great add on to any entertainment center setup

quick easy to use
i purchased one of these for myself back in january and when my mother remarked on it i knew she wanted one a well it work great for both myself and her despite the difference in our reading habit and hand size
a a standalone charger this one doe pretty good and i like the versatility to charge other item with the usb female plug v something hardwired that allows me to charge other usb type device in addition to something that u a micro usb port charging time is faster for a kindle fire v my regular e ink kindle charger but since i have not and rarely fully drain one of my fire i cannot mment on the faster aspect for charging a fire i just know it work and it doe seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from verizon thats not a shocker a this one is watt v for the normal charger this is a replacement model to the original w powerfast charger rather than the prior model square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and stick out further from the socket that seems to add more clutter to a wall socket this year model also ha rigid prong what you stick into the electrical socket v the fold down version of the prior model that give it a lower profile i didnt think too much of it at first but the longer profile of the rectangular design in addition to the electrical prong not folding down into the charger mean it take up a little bit more room in my laptop bag thats not good for me a now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and go into the general pile of stuff that float around in the main bag seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size and it is despite my mments on the change above the powerfast charger amazon make do seem to last ive never had one break a other brand do i just keep leaving them in random hotel and airport while traveling and have to buy another if you are looking for a solid and longer lasting charger for your tablet i would remmend this one
i love my alexa you can ask almost anything great to hear music of all genre with i will probably get an alexa dot for the den
i have get to be disappointed by a tablet from amazon this fire is amazing for the price the speed and quality of this can not be beaten the feature are endless and the screen is beautiful this is so much more than an e reader if you are in the market for both a e reader and a versatile tablet you can not go wrong with this
for the low price this tablet doe the trick mpatible with many apps such a facebook and kindle
this is all you will ever need this box is fast ha a usb slot so you can add space and you can use the wifi or pluge internet directly into it this is a top end box doesnt buffer
i love the paperwhite i had one of the first version of the kindle that had the keyboard and loved it only downfall wa it wa not backlit the paperwhite is and it is awesome
i didnexpect anything le than what i got with this kindle

a friend of mine wa in the market for a new tablet i had researched the fire tab for some time and liked the spec which met her need i decided to buy her one for her b day she love it
if you have an amazon prime acunt you should have a fire tablet it is so easy to have kindle book amazon music and video at your finger tip this is or however much i paid well spent now what i do not like about the tablet is the operating system it is limiting bottomline is if you need to do something other than use the amazon suite of feature you will need another tablet however i have no problem with using this specifically for the amazon stuff and for managing my echo dot
great tablet for beginner very light and screen is wide enjoy using for travel

worth every penny if you set it up rrectly
the best item i have ever seen in my life and so glad i found this item
i bought this a a christmas gift i m told that they are enjoying it and are very happy with all it can do
the sound and picture are great and easy to download apps
you will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price
i am so glad i purchased these we can get all of our favorite movie
i take my paper white reader every where with me it fit nicely in my purse i read all the time even in the car where the sun is shinning in on it i just love my paper white and wish i had bought one sooner
so in reading the review before i got this ver i wa quite worried lot of people reported it feeling cheap flimsy overpriced etc i wa so ncerned in fact i tried to cancel my order i m glad i wa not able to it is perhaps not what people expect the leather is not soft but is rather pressed and almost polished however this ver doe not feel cheap to me it is stylish super light and fit the kindle without those annoying elastic loop or hook on the rners it fit within a rubberized groove on the ver which not only give it a very tight and secure fit it also add protection to the rners of the device and ver it also feel quite secure in the hand so to sum up light secure well made and unobtrusive the price tag uld be debated but i actually do not find it to be overpriced i m quite happy with it
i bought for the wife for a christmas present to replace her old barnes and noble nook she love it it lighter faster and ha a lot of newer apps on it great cheap reader

the fire tv is much better than the stick a it provides more feature and is easy to use i highly remmend it
purchased this and the fire stick this definitely showed a better picture quality and response mpared to the stick k imagine is not bad at all and would nsider this a good deal
terrific product clear sound play great music very enjoyable
entertaining great sound we enjoy using daily and it is very informative
the amazon echo wa a wonderful christmas gift anything you want to know just ask alexa and she will answer
i wa looking for a blutooth speaker to use with my phone but i didnwant to worry about thing being ordered on my amazon acunt or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that ha been in the news the last few month this speaker fit the bill a you can disable order by alexa and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound the speaker quality is great for a portable option the only thing that i do not like is the charging stand can lose connection if it not sitting just right but i cannot knock a star for this a they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem
i love listening to music and awesome tell play certain radio station or music to enjoy a i work took a little getting used to know how phase question to get alexa to answer but we are both are pro now
hard to use no way to delete thing from screen need better manual most book are impossible if they are reference book
originally bought the fire stick worked but not nearly a good a this worth the extra money

amazon echo is pretty ol i m a gadget guy so i enjoy technology like this alexa read the news weather turn my light on and off play music make shopping list etc my only mplaint is that to make a shopping list you have to keep saying alexa alexa add milk to the shopping list alexa add bread to the shopping list alexa add rice to the shopping list and so on so if you have to make a long list it is a little tedious but overall i really like her
a solid well made tablet that feel good in the hand image are crisp clean work well with my hulu acct hbogo acct prime video acct too the first few sec the video is blurry then it clear up and play fine if you add a sd card the tablet automatically place apps video on the sd card if app allows the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video must be a current member onto the sd card for offline viewing i bet a lot of parent will love that for those long car trip sound is good bt worked well with my bt enabled stereo i streamed prime music pandora do not be put off by the screen resolution it look great the new bellini o is a major improvement over the old carousel format of day past the new amazon app underground also add to the value for prime member the lock screen ad are not intrusive once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again if you re a prime member this is the best buck you will spend
i love the ability to connect to the internet via ethernet cable i had fewer buffering issue the upscaling quad re processor also made for a clearer picture
best value tablet for the little one great warranty great parental ntrols it is a shame apple ha not caught on to the need of parent when it me to digital medium
i love the nvenience of using alexa for anything from a timer to answering question being able to get music on voice mmand is great a well a i can pause and resume without grabbing my phone or a remote all the time i would highly an echo to anyone interested

i love my amazon fire tablet i bought this all the while knowing that people had negative review but honestly i do not know what they did to theirs because mine doe not have any issue i have had mine for over a month and still working perfectly like i just bought it yesterday
amazon echo is a great personal assistant i find it more helpful than siri on my iphone it can be used to set timer work out and silly thing like telling joke plus much more also it can be used to turn your home into a smart home which i have done with my light alexa turn on light
great i had a friend set it up for me enjoy music at mmand
the echo is fun functional and entertaining the mmands are appropriately responded to approximately of the time the ability to simply orally request song by a specific artist or a specific song is amazing the music catalogue is extremely large and wide ranging news weather and straight forward informational request are almost always answered rrectly and clearly the technological application are varied and growing they do not interest me yet the music alone make this device a marvel and a bargain
alexa wa so easy to set up and it ha so many feature that you can use i like to do trial and error using alexa it is so much fun i ask her to wake me up in the morning and it really worked i have been having so much fun since i bought it
i bought two of these kindles one for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running however my senior mother found that the touch screen wa not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her a a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it however my tech savvy granddaughter love her already

decent tablet for the price expect just basic use and function this is no ipad be sure you are not expecting that
absolutely love my echo my home is always filled with music i even bought another for upstairs
good for the price a very basic tablet with basic functionality
we bought this amazon tablet because my year received one a a gift for her aunt my year wa using an ipad but kept dropping it this is great because it is small enough for him to hold and if you buy the case it is mpletely protected the only issue we seem to have is that the power rd is really loose when you plug it in to charge so sometimes it doe not get charged that is the only reason i m giving it star
awesome little device i had an apple tv before this fire stick doe the same thing and more for cheaper
this product ha been amazing we got a great deal on the purchase and we have not been disappointed with it is productivity
intuitive little gadget that help with everyday task and information i like that it is portable and i cannotake it outside when i want
nice tablet for the price so far have run all my apps from amazon the only doe require is a better camera
very nice good product and the picture quality are very nice
it a good tablet for my yr old to play game and watch video only thing is the charger doesnt stay in the port and battery doesnt last long
product is good light amazing battery backup i charge the kindle one in week great product for reasonable price usb connection is easy book are easy to download overall everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best product model to start with understandably this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before feature like led light white paper background are not available on this model these feature are there on higher model so one cannot read it in dark without light but again for this price you would not get any other good reader if you are someone who read in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle model
love it whould tell everyone to get one buy it you will have ton of hour to do thing
tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat
i owned a first generation kindle that wa shaped like a book with one side wider and heaver to mimic a spine btw when they first came out then i owned a kindle which really didnimprove much except on the physical shape and memory but this one is a huge improvement having the back lit display is mpletely awesome i thought i wa going to miss a physical keyboard but i definitely do not if you have a non backlit kindle i d definitely remmend this one also i have played with my friend is voyager and i definitely do not think it is worth the extra price for what you get
i bought this for my boyfriend and he love it i still cannot get over how the kindle page look like actual page highly remmended for everyone
received a christmas gift and i love the size and feature of the kindle
this tablet is great for teenager i purchased two for my nephew and they were really happy they immediately began to set it up and download free game they love it
i use it for reading at night in my room the light make it great
we purchased of these for a uple of reason one because we were already amazon prime member and the other wa paying too much for cable tv weve had them now for approx a month one in the living room and one in the bedroom and they work flawlessly easy set up again if you re a prime member just follow the on screen direction we also subscribed to sling tv for those channel we still wanted and purchased an outdoor antenna for local fire tv ha all the apps ready so they make it easy to set up what you want to watch it cannotake a little getting used to apps instead of the tv guide on cable but if you have a smart phone it very similar the fire tv will not work with a standard ir remote so you have to use their remote provided but if you want to use only one remote for everything then i highly remmend the logitech hub system that will ntrol everything including the fire tv i have a tv blue ray fire tv all connected through hdmi in my receiver and only have to use the one logitech remote make sure you get the hub system since it work with ir rf and blue tooth once everything is set up the logitech hub app let you ntrol your system through your smart phone so there is no need to purchase more remote by the way im not an employee of best buy logitech or amazon just an electronics freak but like thing simple i m very satisfied with my purchase and wongo back to cable tv one last thing you still need a broadband connection faster the better and a good wifi router to set this all up
this tablet is affordable and easy to use i highly remmend it
the fire tv is one of the best android box out there great for any streaming medium you can imagine
what you think you need more than a kindle to surf the web you do not cheap and effective plus it is an alarm clock too plus with the right apps it is a radio what is that you say a clock radio you know it hipster
seems smaller than the older version but it still doe the job user friendly
the fire hd tablet is so easy and fun to use take it everywhere love that it is easier to see than a cell phone for those with old eye
hold a charge with regular use for well over a week backlighting is wonderful easy to hold and use with one hand nothing is better take that ipad
search engine uld be better but fine for simple question great for playing music
i purchased two one for my wife and i for a trip to england easy to pack stayed charged readable in all lighting we both like them
our echo ha been a fun purchase for u we have enjoyed hearing the joke and just being goofy with it
this wa just what i needed for surfing the web and watching hbo to go a well a amazon prime and all the book you can get good product
perfect price and just enough memory for anything perfect size great quality this is the th one i bought for someone picture are great also
alexa is great and performs well biggest issue are bing is a horrible search engine and is inevitably wrong v google many time it doe not understand the question or give wrong answer while ok google give much better repossess also amazon music is somewhat limited should allow ability to play sonos or itunes library
finally a woman who listens to me great sound from the speaker and great voice regnition my third echo and i m loving all it can do
a good mputer device to use when traveling at a fair price
i love amazon tablet you got the best of amazon and android apps in one device and for you cannot beat the value i highly remmend purchasing this tablet
bought for my granddaughter age for xmas she love it
the amazon fire tv is a simple to install and use a advertised all you need is your own hdmi cable and everything else is provided for you set up took minute i really like how fast the fire tv is i use it almost exclusively for netflix hulu and live tv streaming thru playstation vue i chose the fire tv over the tv stick because the fire tv ha a faster processor and it work beautifully i would definitely remmend this box for anyone who is looking to cut the rd from cable
bought this to use in the kitchen for just recipe and pinterest but have wound up using it for a regular tablet fast loading and easy to use since i already have an amazon acunt i now have free alexa and so many other benefit
great product easy to set up and use my child love it
what can i say but out of this world this thing is so ol

this is my third kindle and i have loved them all i still have my first kindle and use it i just wore my kindle fire out with year use i am very happy with everything my new one can do no disappointment at all
bought for my k classroom great price for student use
i purchased this in hope of making my existing tv a smart tv honestly i wa kind of disappointed for starter the remote quite a few time lost sync with the box and i had to download the fire tv app to reset the box send it froze nstantly in the middle of using amazon prime it would freeze up now this might just have been the bad one in the batch i dont know but i returned it and are looking for something different
this a great add on for non smart older television with a usb port
i work well for what it is great price and easy setup
this item is great and fun to play with i bought it for my daughter for christmas and she love it will probably purchase one for myself i think it is nice to tell it to cut off the light and turn down the music your playing without having to get up and cutit off i love it when my son yell from his room and ithe an hear him and doe what it is told
my son love it for the music i love it for the daily news flash we love it
i bought this kindle for my grandson and my son wanted one a well they really enjoy using their kindle is for all type of entertainment and downloading apps to play game keep them entertained for hour it wa a great buy

just got my kindle and am just getting use to it like it so far
this thing is ok a long a you do not expect it to be or have stuff apps game like samsung or apple cause it doe not it ha it own line of
fire tv is a better option than the stick if you are either needing a wired ethernet connection that is the fastest or installing third party software like kodi the extra memory make the menu much faster than the stick it is an awesome product
i already ha an older version of the kindle but this one is even better i love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without button
i am very satisfied with this new kindle i had gotten another brand but had to return it because of problem getting book from a library after talking to my library on how to download book with this kindle it wa a breeze the only thing about getting book from the library amazon will not let some library book be downloaded all in all i really like this product
i initially read e book on my old kindle that needed a light i then migrated to using my mini ipad with a kindle app the brightness bothered my eye and outside it wa pretty useless i bought the paper white a it ha a backlight that is not too strong love it
great for a beginner tablet bought this for my mother for christmas and she love it play all the android game on it and run no problem
great basic tablet for kid and novice worth a try
i enjoy it it connect fast it is small but i needed something i can put on my purse
because of the reasonable st i wa able to buy of these tablet for my grandchild for christmas and to date they are working just great
the battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine
i wa looking for a tablet for my year old this tablet wa definitely worth the price and it is not a kiddie tablet a she call them
the fire tablet doe everything i need it to do bought this a a gift for my year old and he uld not be happier he can download all his game and apps i like the parental ntrols on it
great the kid love it for learning on and great on long trip
awesome device using it to cut the rd and it work great
if you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you re looking for it really is lightweight and highly functional the battery last a long time and the screen is easy on the eye the only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environment overall an excellent buy
the first thing i noticed about the echo wa not speaker is very loud and clear i can hear it from a good distance away i m upstairs in my house i can hear the speaker which is on the bottom floor she responds to my music request how to make shopping list tell me the weather and give me daily news update i like this better than the google home assistant since the speaker so much better
work pretty good hey alexa whats this whats that i love it
i have had several kindles from the kindle keyboard the fire hdx and a previous version of the paperwhite to me it is the best way to read you can have hundred of book at your disposal having the g version enables me to download book anywhere without being connected to wi fi i love my paperwhite
good for pleasure not for work but good value for what you pay
my echo is great great for entertaining we put it in a large room and it easily fill it with sound
i use my fire tv daily and it performs perfectly i have a smart tv but the fire tv run much faster
i love my echo there are so many feature i havent even gotten to use yet i remmend highly

i bought for our oldest grandkids age to and they loved them very easy for them to set up themselves and get started using them with very little help from thier parent great product for the price
being used on a daily basis and never fails great product
i wa originally paranoid of these always listening device but then i disvered what uld be done with home automation and i wa hooked i now have echo an echo dot and dash wand i can ntrol my light and tv now with my voice the echo sound fantastic playing music a well really ol device
echo ha many possibility we do not get to far into them mostly we use to stream music and news source the device is active in our day to day it read me then news while i make ffee we also use it to order an uber highly remmend

pick the fire tv over the apple and we are glad we did we didneven realize how many free apps and show you can watch without being a prime member great buy i wish we had bought one a lot sooner and dropped cable
i purchased this a a gift for my daughter i tried it with her at her home and wow accurate clear and loud only draw back is that the music selection can only me from amazon prime not your own catalog at least that is what i am told other than that it really work great
if you want a good tablet and do not want to spend a lot of money i remmend this well made and reliable i have one for myself and bought one a a gift

this is a good tablet for someone just wanting to surf the internet would buy again if wa only surfing
have purchased one and found it amazing i bought send one for my father who find it hilarious
i never thought i would need this having siri but siri cannot tie alexas shoe lace i have her tied into my home automation system and it amazing the speaker quality is not the greatest but not to shabby the only mplaint i have is having multiple echo i cannot sync them over all a must buy
i eventually had to return it because of the shade of yellow in the back light when using it at night it wa okay at day time but at night during which i usually read it wa not what i expected to be premium st product especially it wa very annoying to read in the landscape mode i guess amazon need a better qa department
alexa is awesome work for what i want next light she actually listens to me at first i had my reservation but it surpassed my expectation really wish i had more time to learn new thing to do with it
easy to set up and connects without issue add a few wifi switch and skill and you have a voice activated smart house plus you cannotalk to alexa and not feel lonely
so happy i ordered this at the same time a my kindle
i bought this for my son is first tablet i really like the product like the parental ntrols for him i am not thrilled that with any parental ntrols he cannot have free access to the web it is blocked mostly need a bit more memory so get an sd card i would rate it lower because of this but for what i paid i just cant the graphic on netflix are good i cannot me up with one reason for the price to give it le than star i own a ipad and it rival it especially for the price difference

for someone with extremely weak eye kindle is a savior i love reading but reading book is stressful for my eye because of the font and not proper lighting all the time with kindle i always have the back light and the i customize the font of each book so it is much easier on my eye

i really love the echo i actually bought it to listen to music but i use it for many other thing
there is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the amazon kindle it still doe not support epub format of urse amazon doe not like mpetition it is built ok moderately cheap plastic but no squeaking at least ntrast is ok i had nook and it is on par i cannot imagine how bad the regular kindle would be though this one with dpi is just ok scrolling is fast enough it ha integrated vocabulary no home menu or other physical button though besides the home kindle one the ui is not mpletely responsive when you try to go to your library instead home brings you to amazon kindle page where you are overwhelmed with advertisement my biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the nvoluted interface it is way worse then nook which is much more reading centric a lot of cheap and free book are available on amazon especially with prime membership it can be linked to public library for ebooks a well
use it every night to watch amazon television in bed play game read book great item
i have multiple fire device in my home they work great and allow me to access ton of ntent from k down to sd
great sound from a small speaker responds well to verbal mmands

it is a great delivery vehicle for all your amazon video and music need i bought it to watch playstation vue no more expensive time warner cable for me it is built on android o so you can install andriod apps what i love about this box is that i can load my old school ne and snes emulator and play them with the bluetooth ntroller you can also set up kodi on it and you have got all kind of movie tv music and gaming option using it with micro sd card support and an extra usb port this device is so much better than the tv stick and it is a lot speedier highly remmended

when i picked up this product i ordered additional for christmas they sent me to the moa store and said they are in stock i received the text from best buy stating that they have been picked for me once i arrived they had one but stated the other one had been sold i asked if they uld get another from another location and they simply stated that it wa a popular item for christmas and they are probably out of stock after asking four time i picked up the phone and called duluth since the website stated that they had some the store manager looked at me and decided i wa serious about checking another store i spoke with a rep in duluth and he state that he just got off the phone with the manager of the moa location and he wa shipping one to moa so i hung up the phone about minute later the manager came back out to talk to me and he stated they didnhave anymore i mentioned that i spoke with someone there and he spoke with the manager at moa and wa shipping it to him the manager denied that he spoke with him i requested someone from best buy leadership contact me and still have not heard from anyone at best buy the manager i dealt with at the moa wa link
brought this for my son for xmas he loved it and wa very happy with it
good price battery life is good for a lor tablet but you have to learn to charge more often after being used to a white page tablet that doe not use the same power
i had read review it is just like what review said it is really good i still have to try some feature probably i should have gone for kindle light maybe next time but for now i am totally satisfied
great price for tablet son love it easy to use
we bought these for our kid and they really love them
wall charger is nvenient just wish it wa sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate seems like it should be standard in the package had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle
it worked really well for me a i am unschooled in ipads i used it while traveling and it wa easy to use and did the thing i needed i e map book downloaded internet access youtube etc i do not play game so cannot mment on that
all four of my kid have this kindle they doe freeze every now and again but overall they are great the new camera is not a favorite the last version camera wa better

my husband love this we upled it with the playstation vue streaming service for mo and dropped x cable totally we found that the amazon fire box offer a channel guide for p vue that the roku doe not which is def a helpful feature to have with p vue
i love being able to choose what i want to watch
android unfortunately always is buggy and whether it nexus or amazon they have the task of cleaning up the bug and unlike some people i am not mplaining the bug will be fixed soon just like the first one anyways this device is giving more everything at the same price thanks amazon
great over the top device the alexa integration is a major plus
permanent offer of game are a nuisance but the reading experience is very good
bought this for my daughter and she cannot even use it because it is not kid friendly it is so incredibly slow it freeze often and doe not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to also wa supposed to me with a year free of amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month it requires you to put a card number in before initial use keep calling amazon and the foreign people cannot seem to figure out the problem do not buy
it is a great device to have it doe so many thing very practical
alexa doe not always have the answer to a question i ask but she is a lot of fun to play with she can be utilized for so many purpose from a timer to playing a specific song great fun for all age
purchased a gift have not heard of any defect
overall i wa not too impressed with his tablet actually returned it for an ipad mini bc my kid like it better and it wa easier to use
nice size very clear but randomly shuts off cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen if you watch video it buffer alot and laggs
i wanted to get my month old a tablet to start with and this wa a good pick
a wonderful product for those who are not on the apple hype train easy to use and the price wa on point expandable memory really make this a million time better than the baser ipads
cannot believe i waited so long to get a real e reader so easy to read from
kindle is good i got one for my husband and sister they are really enjoying them it is easy to use for someone who never used one my reason for not giving star wa mpletely due to my best buy experience i live in a small town and drove thirty mile to get to best buy only to find they were mpletely out asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me i wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any i wa willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them they would not do that i had to drive another mile to pick one up just thought best buy should have tried to be more acmmodating but it wa christmas shopping season
the only n i see is the exclusion of the optical sound out put the micro sd slot is a nice addition
i bought the tablet for my child and they loved it
like the fir one that fold in prong better
great if you just want to read and occasionally browse the web great value
this wa a really good bargain for the price it wa easy to set up this device is easy to use and ha many good function
purchased for my year old mother she love it
this is not a bad tablet for the price i personally need a little more on high end side the plastic look doe not do it for me it ha a expandable micro sd slot and decent battery life i gifted it to the mr and she love it
overall we enjoy our new echo tower the speaker is not the same quality a our sonos or bose speaker but the nvenience of being able to ask alexa to play a song or find a style of music or tell you the weather or traffic a you are running out the door make up for the quality the kid love asking her to rap or tell a joke i look forward to syncing alexa to more of our iot item to make ntrols hand free
nnects to anything light camera if you have amazon prime there unlimited music
love the look feel and the light that this device ha
good price for a high quality product easy to use and navigate
an excellent product you can stream everything on it
mother needed something since her tablet had died wa lot easier for her to learn than her old table she doe lot more with kindle than she did with tablet

i wa uncertain about the fire tablet since i own an ipad mini bought it for my mother and love it it work smoothly the system is awesome and my mother love it a well i also got the hd for my daughter
work very well even after the novelty wore off we have found it entertaining and useful
with so many program choice available with amazon fire stick why would you want cable cable is just too expensive this is a much cheaper alternative to cable
great electronic product would definitely remmend it
i really enjoy the amazon tablet for paying my bill online and looking up recipe
excellent sound and voice regnition would remmend to friend
we decided to cut the cable and love the option the fire tv give u
didnreally do it for me being an ipad user this unit wa really foreign if you are familiar with amazon fire product it will be great for you

i bought it a gift to my neiece and she liked it
the kid love them i purchased some tablet the year before off amazon and they were cheap and broke quick i spent the same on these this last christmas and they seem sturdier and better picture quality
except unlike the millennium faln this doe not have it where it unts software is a mess i didnexpect much from a tablet but man wa it painful to use
i like it because is very resistant the only thing we didnlike is that sometimes it is kinda slow
i can hold this next to my kindle paperwhite and see that is brighter more evenly lit sharper and faster but is pushing the price a little high if a friend wa not looking to buy my old one not sure i would have paid that much
i love my kindle fire it is very nvenient and handy perfect size
great streaming device with a lot of option to watch highly remmended and super easy to install and use
it is awesome with low price and high quality my daughter like it very much
it a great device entertains my year old and good for my wife a well
a friend remmended the tablet and i am happy with it
good tablet for kid can use for gaming and school work
great value this tablet is great for everything it is not a powerful a an ipad but the price cannot be beat
bought for my son no need to worry about an expensive tablet getting broken best i ever spent for him
work great for my year old i do not like that it requires a pin to use it but goodidnand strong tablet
i paid about le than the going price for this i cannot mplain for any reason on this based on what wa paid is it the perfect tablet well there are some limitation however i have paid far more in the past for mparable tablet that didnoffer any more than this i picked up multiple one and they are scattered through the house and all being put to use
outstanding product at a great price i previously hand a kindle reader and the fire is a much improved product
really great item for the kid and very user friendly
bought it a a christmas present based on input from a friend of mine
et me start by saying please do not buy this tablet expecting it to be mparable to an ipad or samsung tablet i think the people who expect that are the one who are disappointed by it feature i personally love this tablet i wanted a tablet so that i uld read check email watch show hulu netflix amc shop online and do some web surfing i am a pretty simple gal i did not expect much when purchasing this tablet i assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor that it would load pretty slowly and that i would be unable to download most of the apps i wanted it would not have bothered me being that i believe you get what you pay for and i uld not afford an ipad or samsung at the moment boy wa i proven wrong i wa pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment i turned it on i have had other tablet and paid about the same with terrible picture quality i actually love watching my show on this tablet because it is a if i am watching them on my television this tablet load pretty darn quickly i have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck i have been able to download every app that i wanted except instagram oh well no biggie and me being the amazon freak that i am i wa happy to see amazon apps pre loaded onto the tablet shopping music etc speaking of music the sound quality is pretty great too i am very very happy with this purchase it really is a steal i would buy another for sure
awesome tablet it is fast and easy to use affordable cannot find any better at this price
purchased to replace an old tablet to have around and for child everyone like it
bought it for my parent they love it buying another for my llege daughter
i am a long time kindle user but a few year back switched to a kindle fire then a lenovo window tablet and while the tablet worked well for reading nothing beat the experience of the kindle screen and the paperwhite is a great upgrade on the original kindle is screen
having a great time with alexia i gave two of these away a christmas gift and got the best gift award from my child
i purchased this tablet a a gift for a graduate based on the remmendation of a best buy associate the graduate ha provided great review and ntinues to use it it wa easy for her to set up and she able to access apps and program that meet her need i woul remmend this tablet based upon my experience
perfect gift for my nephew he is and love to play game and his mom love the parental ntrol feature
the tablet is great and i like the warranty that it me with but i do not like the charging port the wire that me with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then do not touch it had to buy an after market cable with an mm plug length to get it to charge we bought of the tablet and they both did the same thing on one of the tablet we bought one of the magnetic plug so that a younger child will not have problem with a loose plug
it doe everything i need a table to do and it is really fast
this tablet look and feel nice good battery life and great image good value for the money
the shopping list is a great feature but it uld use some improvement like adding multiple list music sound good on it the kid and her friend love playing with it
make any tv a smart tv lightning fast gig processor
nothing fancy a good budget tablet that doe what it suppose to do
alexa work great with music just wish you didnneed premium spotty to use it on alexa
force update when turned it on for the first time have to wait for an hour with nothing to do on the tablet really bad user experience
good product good service attended real good find product ok
she is always there to answer a question and the integration with other home automation system is great we just tell the house what to do and she doe it
outstanding i love this device highly remmend it for anybody and everyone user friendly
really like the amazon fire tv it is an awesome product to have for tv lover make sure u have strong wifi
i use mine for email facebook game and to go on line i also have down loaded book i use it to take photo it is small and be taken easily i would remmend it to anyone
i love it it is simple and easy i love how you cannotake anywhere and alexa listens to you right away
great light weight tablet that uploads quickly would remmend
i bought this for my mom for christmas it wa easy to set up ha a great sound and work great
it easy to use and the price wa great my son love it
my year old love iteasy to setup and navigate
the fire tablet ha an android operating system but is not like using an android phone amazon is software make the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze also you cannot download apps from google play you have to get them from the amazon app store there are several apps from amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them would not remmend without having amazon support
i love my echo great for music great sound and i can listen to any genre of music i like doe so many thing incredible
it is nice for the price nice gift for kid and grandparent
one of the important reason i purchased this wa for hbo go app which they have but doe not work with charter mcast a quite large market of people affected so a useless claim they readily put out there that you can play it what else can you not use it for i have not found yet but amazon ha not written me back after i emailed them about this issue im stuck with waste of money and will go get a google chrome now
we love the echo for music if you have amazon prime just ask her to play a song artist or even genre and she doe we also love using her for timer reminder and to create grocery list
the amazon echo is not bad she seems pretty intelligent but sometimes she doe not seem to understand simple question
ordered dec th and got my order after christmas and it wa supposed to be delivered on dec th
i had an older kindle paperwhite went to visit family forgot to bring it purchased this new one i love it my husband is now using my old one i wongo anywhere without my kindle
my son love it there are a lot of kid friendly apps available
i love this tablet it is just the perfect gadget for my everyday life

love it work a expected very helpful best voice assistant out there
easy to use work great when you have an amazon acunt
i do not like it i would not remmend this to anyone
my kid love this tablet all the fun without the steep price
this kindle is awesome i love the design of it nothing software wise that wa different than my other kindle but the way it is designed make it much more mfortable and easier to read the only reason i didngive it five star wa because of the price if it were cheaper this kindle would have been five star no doubt
family member really like it and say it fun using it all the time
year old son love it it is dependable and enomical in price all feature are easy to use and make reading fun if your child is into reading book on te web
good and performance is also good worth the money spent
hard to find any gripe for this device serf it purpose brilliantly the backlight is excellent and the built in dictionary is great
i love the amazon echo it ha always worked flawlessly for u
the echo is amazing i highly remmend this product
this is a good device everything work the way it should
i like it it is better to read book online even i owned iphone ipad and itc
for an inexpensive tablet it work great doe the basic very well
great for surfing the web book you tube and email so far love the size too
echo is wonderful and super smart love you can interrupt a skill and she will return to it when finished with what you asked her
not user friendly in regard to mpatibility with google play service play store etc definitely need to be improved upon
purchased it for the kid and they love it easy to use
great product this is the best streaming box out there besides the nvidia shield tv but much more affordable i m thinking of getting another one
love my kindle so when mother table died i brought her this and now i do not get call all the time to help her figure out where everything is
this is an amazing item for the money cheaper then my first scientific calculator many year ago
this thing is amazing i had a roku and a matrim g box before it it is fast ha expandable storage usable usb port and you can easily side load kodi the only gripe i have is that there is no ir ntrol so you cannot program it to a smart remote i do like the fact they make an app for io and android so that make it a bit better but it would be nice to have one remote ntrol i can use to ntrol everything
amazing how low st this tablet is good for basic apps and browsing ha ad on the lock screen unless you pay to get rid of them but is just the lock screen and doe not interfere with any functionality for st cannot go wrong
i used to read book off my ipad but i love the kindle so much more easier on my eye easier to take with me when i travel overall so much better for reading
got this tab for my year old daughter shes always on my phone or tablet so got her her very own it ha all the function and apps she like and u not to hard to use and get the job done for the right price she is so she will drop and be rough with the tablet seems sturdy enough and not expensive that it is going to break the bank if she damage it
purchased a a gift perfect for small child easy to use especially for child is apps with the touch screen
the product work very well but the user interface is too busy and not really tunable it is also difficult to search for new apps that are not already listed voice ntrol work okay but alexa remains a far cry from siri
the fire tv work great and is very fast some apps are in the cloud but others have to be purchased through amazon only problem wa getting battery ver off of remote
i wanted a low st but quality tablet and this one is a dream easy to navigate and excellent graphic
this is a very good product and is the better in the market thanks
enjoy using alexa every night she is amazing i d remmend it to everyone
for reading only purpose this kindle paperwhite fit the bill and is easy to carry everywhere and catch up on some reading i m glad i made this purchase would highly remmend

i purchased this firetv device so i can stream watch cable channel using p vue the p vue interface on this device is very similar to the p version the only other app i use is netflix and both apps work great so far
wa hesitate about buying the echo because of price when it went on sale i said i had to have it after realizing what it is and how to use it even if it wa not on sale i would have ordered anyway
love the simplicity also love that i use it for reading only and cannot download distracting apps
i bought and am returning them both both had lighting issue on the first one one half of the screen had a white blue tint and the other half wa more of a yellow tint when i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand half of the screen went much darker than the other i returned it because i had read there were some that had lighting issue and bought another one my send one wa worse you uld see little half moon going down one side that one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one i found it not easy to hold unless it wa in the charging case it wa too slippery and weird to say small for me i m a female with average sized hand i think what i really did love wa the charging case and the size for transport purpose maybe when they make a few tweak and lower the price i might try again
great product would totally remmend it to anyone

my daughter love it much faster than her last tablet
the echo by amazon ha exceeded even my own high expectation which is quite an acheivement
i really enjoy my fire tablet i am able to read watch video tv show and much more it is awesome for my little one but it do not have youtube kid instead you can pull up youtube kid on the regular part of the table using the internet that became a plus with my kid i like how you can customize it to fit your child age
it is extremely handy and easy to use the library of book available on amazon is extensive the ability to have a device that can hold hundred of book in the palm of your hand is unparalleled
very easy to use and also easy to handle portable with a news app very informative i would racmend this tablet to anyone that craves portability great also for prime member
sound production is outstanding very easy to set up and use
the tablet meet my immediate need of email game even social networking also pleased with streaming of my favorite site a little slow but maybe the network also amazon is technical service wa excellent i had a bad day and wa frustrated with start up which is easy when in your right mind anyway the technician deescalated excellently
awesome product it is better than cablev my family and all love it

this toy is easy to setup and the k feature mpliments my k tv the dedicated amazon fire tv work better than amazon in my smart tv
this is the rd paperwhite i have purchased for me and a gift absolutely love them
i heart alexa i use the shopping list app and use it to stream music all the time my kid love asking it joke and riddle my only mplaint is that i want a send one whenever i move it to a different room it can be a pain it take it a while to rennect and it can be aggrivating a long a i do not move it unplug it i m fine
bought this tablet for my fiancã e daughter after getting it home and set up i decided to keep it for myself great screen and work great with my pair of amazon echo i love it and highly remmend it
great for reading in bed or reading on the beach in the sun with or without sunglass
had to buy a new kindle because on my fire hd the battery quit holding a charge wa told there wa nothing you uld do
it is very appealing for the price but know in advance that the warranty is only day i did not so when my son device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over month after he got it i didnrush to call i have been taking care of seriously ill family member so i put customer service on the bottom of my list of priority since i thought i had time especially knowing that these type of call can sometimes take hour which i didnhave today my son wa home sick so i had the day to do the thing at the bottom of my list so i called amazon minute later after doing all their trouble shooting step three time and being disnnected once she decided to tell me that my warranty wa only for day but she would be happy to help me buy one for only ok after i calmly explained to he that that wa full price and i wa not about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two month she put me on hold and minute later she told me that they would generously give me off my next purchase moral of the story know before you buy if you still buy call the minute the thing break even if that mean your mom will be an hour late for chemo i guess also during my minute search for who to call about the defect since it wa not on the box i found the amazon support number on a thread with at least other people talking about their defective charging port keep that in mind if is something you can spend every month it might be worth it
have always been pleased with best buy and will ntinue to purchase all of my equipment there
i love the lor is choose and the tablet is great
i am extremely satisfied with this tablet for the price i paid it wa inexpensive and it work wonderfully i remmended it to my sister who also purchased one

excelent for reading and for the kid own two of these and they both work perfectly
ok i would not be remend this product at all okk
she love it she is yr old and it fit her level well and she just love it
i purchased it to see if the stream speed would be quicker than my amazon firestick but wa disappointed the stream speed is at the mercy of your internet provider the processing speed is faster than the firestick but in the end it ha the same memory a the firestick for the price the amazon firestick is better if all you do is stream it might be a good fit for gamers
we bought several for our employee party i liked it so much i bought one for myself
this is excellent for kid the only thing i do not like is it is difficult to go to kid web page by typing in an web address once you set up the kid profile plus it take away the easy access of the camera which the kid love i may have set it up wrong a it did not me with printed instruction and i am not tech savvy this item is extremely durable and great fun for the kid
i bought this product since my wife purchaser a number of book from amazon we also wanted easy access to our email
i have both fire tv and the fire stick the fire tv can connect via cable to internet andcis definitely faster than the stick also had more storage if you do not need to connect wirelessly and do not mind the extra get the fire tv
we gave this a a gift to an older person to basically use a an e reader so far it ha worked great
my wife love this product i never thought she would ever let go of paperback but the ease of use and nvenience when travel make this perfect for her because she love read when we go to the beach
what is there to say about the best inch andriod tablet there is
we bought this for daughter for christmas fantastic tablet
great sound easy to connect problem is it not voice activated so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it that mean it ha b close at hand
wanted something with a kid mode on it so we uld limit time and ntent this work saw it for a really low price so uld not resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kid version
i love the the kindles bought this for my grandson impressed with the year no question asked warranty
i love using alexa but it is hard to get information from her sometimes and she say she doe not know it also hard to keep the outlet working with it
very easy to use i bought it for my year old quality and ease of use is really great would remmend buying this first before getting an ipad for your child
i had an old kindle and it battery wa beginning to fail the kindle fire replaces it with much more functionality it doe however require charging more often
i bought this a a christmas present on black friday for an incredible price
excellent product and the price is exeptional the unit in stock and grate for educational purpose
i am very happy with this tablet it wa an upgrade from the kindle paperwhite the screen is very sharp and the tablet is very lite
so my old kindle stopped working recently not sure why but it would not connect to our new router so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for which is a great deal for a lor kindle tablet i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and remove the blue led light so far i have read book in the past month on this kindle and it flawless
great tablet good value for money i got this a xmas gift for my famaily
i had an older kindle but always had to have a light to read at night i love the kindle paper white it fantastic
i love my kindle i wonbe without one i have even bought an extra one just in case i believe it is the best tablet on the market
expensive speaker voice regnition doe not work so well skill set is extemely limited even though amazon claim

it is a great and affordable tablet for my year old grandson it keep up with the higher speed internet

the echo is a fun device the entire family can enjoy
doe not load up cnn or travel channel i even have directnow for a month and mb internet speed and the new google wifi router i give up and will just go back to regular cable and pay the extra for le hassle cable satellite win
amazon fire tv is the perfect streaming box if you are getting rid of cable plenty of apps good quality video and easy to use
problem is battery life seems short mpared to earlier model
i would like to say this is my best tablet i have ever buy till now i will rate it more then ipad mini it best with battery wifi touchscreen sound etc i had other tablet for my kid earlier but after having fire hd i will not remmend or like to go for any other brand in future you cannot get such good quality product in such le price i am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd for my family and kid
a no frill budget tablet although it can do some light gaming i would not remmend it for that it best at watching video browsing the web and reading
love the echo great for all kind of activity i mostly use mine for the news and turning on the light
i wa not too sure about getting a tablet at first i have had an iphone for year and have always loved reading hard ver book i wa also ncerned that i would have a hard time learning the software other than apple i m happy to report that the software wa not difficult to adjust to in the least and i thoroughly enjoy reading on a tablet now
this is our nd amazon echo already we got the black in in our living room this on outlr master is bedroom they are amazing product
this kindle ha better resolution and ntrast ratio it is light and mfortable i would remmend this device at deal price
much sleeker and touch response is better even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in ram
it wa an unexpected gift i like this more than the alexa because this one is portable it is great for streaming music my kid use it all the time only problem so far is it doe not always understand what i m saying especially when saying the name of a radio station sometimes take few try before i get what i m looking for it ha great sound when playing music talk radio is not a good but understandable if you want a portable speaker and alexa this is the one to get
i got this for during black friday since i have had it i noticed that the battery life doe not last very long i have to charge it at least once a day at first i thought that i may have a faulty tablet but i looked on amazon is website and the fire ha a battery life of hour no wonder the size of the fire though is small enough that i cannotake it with me when i go out and am waiting to pa the time i also bring this with me to the gym and watch movie or read on it while i m on the treadmill or stationary bike i use the fire for different thing mainly to play apps and stream video on amazon prime for these function there is a little in the animation when i play game but it is not frequent i have read several book on the fire and i must say that i prefer to read off of the nook hd the print on the fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not a crisp a the nook since the fire is from amazon it is locked down to only work with amazon approved apps a i mentioned earlier i have a nook a well on that i am able to download the kindle app and read book that i have purchased through amazon on the nook on the fire however i am not able to download the nook app so that i can read book that i have purchased through for the nook overall for the price that i paid this is not bad this is one of those tablet that if it get dropped i would not get a headache over it
it wa a christmas gift not a big reaction at the time he ha very poor vision so i thought it would be a good gift i think he is starting to like it a he u it more and learns what he can do with it
i love it work great i bought my son one to he love it i would remmend it to anyone
wanted to start my year old with a small tablet because they claimed their to big for a regular kid tablet this wa perfect for them the picture quality is awesome
this wa a excellent gift for someone who like to read alot
i have not purchased a dedicated reader before but bought this for a cruise where i knew it would be too sunny for an ipad and this wa easy to load up with book for my kid and i and it looked great in the bright sun while wearing sunglass happy with the purchase
my grandson love it and there are lot of educational game
so easy to use mpact easy to carry in my bag love it
really like this allows me to set reminder and listen to sirius radio easy to set up
i bought this for my wife she had an older st gen reader from another mpany and the difference are astounding setup wa easy and getting ntent uld not be easier the unit is light really light mpared to an ipad it is truly air pun it work well in any light ndition so far the navigation is a little squirrelly and take getting used to and there can be a slight delay after a press so that cannotake getting used to
we have had fun with asking alexa random question that she readily answer in addition to enjoying the various station and music list available to u i m sure we will never exhaust echo is ability a it doe a lot and we re sure enjoying it
bought for my kid and they love it amazon on top again
i bought for my kid for reading and they are slowly but gradually picking up how to use them they thought i bought it to download game i told them one game each and the rest book
i liked the sound quality ming out of the echo i ended up returning this for an echo dot the dot is rd of the price and for my townhouse i do not need a high powered speaker alexa is great to use no matter what echo device you have
easy to use perfect for using for my clinicals in nursing school
awesome to have verry nvient i would like to have one in every room
i owned a kindle keyboard for about a year and i purchased the leather lighted case for that unit while the rner light left a little to be desired a far a even lighting overall i wa very pleased with the case based on that experience i went ahead and purchased the lighted ver for my new kindle i cannot say this experience ha a been a positive let is start off with what is good about the case the kindle battery powered light is a big improvement the light is now centered on the screen so illumination is more even now i do not use the light often but in the case where i do it will be nice to have more balanced verage one positive on the case itself is that i appreciate how much lighter this one feel than the previous generation the hinge area is smaller which mean le of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use i never took my kindle keyboard out of the case after it wa put in so the snug fit i have seen mplaints about is not an issue for me it is tight though so if you do not plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out in my situation that tight fit is exactly what i want but your mileage may vary now on to the negative the case doe feel very cheap especially with no change in price point the previous ver felt like a solidly made piece of work whereas the new ver only feel half a sturdy the thinness of the case wa no doubt done to minimize it weight so i realize this is a personal issue outside the thickness though it just doe not look or feel a well made the textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel very much like a real book finally the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device read more
very good value for money you will not be disappointed if you choose the fire tv
love the hd the extra inch make a huge difference over the hd
clear screen button act up a little after numerous day of review i feel that this wa the best option
many daily feature that can be used to make your life a little easier play your choice of music on mmand creates to do list for you can make adjustment to the warmth or olness in your home
i purchased three of these tablet a christmas gift for my kid it wa a great deal since best buy had them on sale for ea they were very excited to get their own tablet the inch is a bit small for my taste however great for kid the amazon service that provides ample apps for kid is a great deal since you can add up to four kid on one acunt
my husband love it and so do i now that i understand how to work it you must start your question off by saying alexa
this little tablet is excellent for what it is i have a prime acunt so there are many feature available on this advice with that membership we mostly use this to stream music in our lounge and it work well for that purpose
i have other kindle and got this just so everyone ha access to all of our prime membership feature and so they would leave my kindle hd alone lol easy setup and straightforward intuitive to use
work the way it should however i am baffled that there is no way to set up recurring reminder aka take pill etc
great addition for those that are building onto your smart home great connection with nest hue light and august lock have two dot a well great machine
got one for my nephew very easy setup and ha a ton of game to download
i purchased alexa since i have amazon prime i decided i loved it so much i bought echo dot to put around my house i love being able to talk to the air and have thing turn on off order thing on amazon play music listen to the news this device changed my life
too slow for me you tube do not work sometimes able to download some book from amazon prime
great product to use easy to setup and use with all amazon option
with this rd generation of the kindle paperwhite amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price i previously owned a first generation paperwhite and the increase in resolution ppi up from ppi is really noticeable after reading on this for a while it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edge around text of the older paperwhite the white balance of the screen ha also improved with a slightly warmer book ish experience instead of the oler electronic display ish screen of the old on additionally the screen can get crazy low in brightness ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the light turned off if you thought the previous kindles got dark this take it to a whole new level of dimness
friend remmended this product mainly use for music but ntrols my tv and fios
the inch fire is is great reader star the only down side are limited add on application
best buy wa running a sale on these and i thought i d give it a try i wa not expecting much but wa pleasantly surprised i m an apple guy so siri ha been my go to virtual assistant i must say that i am duly impressed with alexa she seems to understand me better than siri doe all the skill and the ability to play music by just asking is really great the fact that this is all available in a portable device that i cannotake with me everywhere i go is so useful the tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connection so i can use it anywhere unlike it non portable brother the echo you push a button to issue mmands to alexa on the plus side you do not have to say alexa on the negative side you still have to push the button i understand why this ha to be the case a it would not last long on battery power if alexa wa listening all the time amazon should issue a firmware update to allow alexa to listen all the time when plugged in the sound quality is good not great other speaker in the category sound better but none have all the nvenience of alexa bluetooth wifi and portability in one package i ll be buying more a christmas gift

i would say this is great for kid but the apps are very limited there are only a few good free apps in the kindle store the battery life is very poor the volume is either loud or it cannot be heard it is hard to find a good middle ground overall it is still a good tablet for the price

i have purchased several kindles over the year this is the only one that ha given me issue purchased this one exchanged it i eventually exchanged the exchange for the same reason the first two kindles didnwant to turn on would freeze so far this one ha not had any issue what so ever doe everything my mother need it for downloading thousand of book watching video non stop docked a star due to mplications with the first two if i have to visit a store within the first month of a purchase twice that is an issue
this wa one of the best purchase that i have ever made

purchased for my son right before a family trip this thing is great and pack all the feature i uld have asked for
i had two of these in le than a year it is definitely good for the price the problem is that the charger port break very often no matter how gentle toy are it deteriorates within a uple month
bought for my kid for christmas great tablet for the price
only reason i wa not able to rate this five of five is that the app m cloud library is not yet mpatible so getting book from the library requires an older app which doe not work a well
excellent tablet at an exceptional price i highly remmend this tablet
this is a fun device for listening to music and getting news update i thought it would have a bit more functionality but i think i need to explore apps that it work with and i am sure more will be ming but for the price point the speaker alone is worth it
bought this so i can have k from playstation vue to my new samsung k tv
love this gadget it is pretty amazing for adult and child very useful
doe everything i expected it wa very easy to hook up
great with the speaker add good sound to the other feature
i bought a a christmas gift for my year old and she love it it work great and my package arrived early with no issue
wanted to travel without my laptop found the fire to be perfect used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with facebook post of friend found the size of screen to be easy to read typing a tad unmfortable until one ha some experience using it have yet to use a an ereader
you have to purchase to many accessory for it to work
this ha been one of the best set top box replacement experience ever i love that it mbines all available online video ntents in one great interface and very stable too
my soul purpose for buying this item wa to read which i am mpletely satisfied for it howevef the camera quality is not of great quality
this is an absolute steal at the price great product with great functionality
this box is definitely better than the fire stick if you have amazon prime and netflix you do not really need cable with this box
light weight user friendly tablet doe everything that expensive tablet do and more best value for the money
this tablet stand head and shoulder above the rest when it me to proportion of price quality amazon ntinues to improve upon it quality
utilizing alexa ha been a great way to connect and ntrol the device in my home alexa wa simple to set up and is easy to use
tablet is worth for the price it is really fast in response
i so enjoy alexa my favorite radio station is just a request away a is most information great nversation piece
still disvering what it can do but it is a great item
echo wa easy to install and start using i thought i would have difficulty getting it to work i just plugged it in downloaded the app and began using it
my son talked me through the job easier than i would have expected
perfect for my need really enjoy it easy to use
i like this because i can plug in anywhere it is unnecessarily expensive
i love alexa she pretty much run the whole household talk about smart my favorite part is she can ntrol the thermostat if you re thinking of getting one she ll be waiting at best buy
seems to be relatively user friendly but a a new tablet owner i would have appreciated having some basic instruction me with it rather than have to learn everything by trial and error i m sure i still do not understand many of the capability this tablet ha to offer
my kid loved and i very happy for this tablet thanks
christmas gift for my son he really like it easy to operate
love voice ntrolling my lites and small appliance but there are some bug to work out sometimes have to ask twice sometimes doe not regnise them but i am patient u bing a a search not impressed
waited quite a while before buying this kindle reaader weighed it heavily against an ipad talked to friend about their experience with reeaders the kindle just seemed like it would do the job i wanted much betterand the price wa fantastic i have beeen pleasantly surprised with what a kindle can acmplish and how easy it is to use
i have not figured out the full potential of this device the sound quality is surprisingly nice for the size of the machine if you order home product from amazon on a regular basis then this is the toy for you all you have to do is say alexa order laundry detergent boom it is done and on it way to your house so becareful when you are telling alexa to order stuff
i always liked reading book in physical form but it just got to hard to carry around plus my bookshelf wa too full this solves both problem
got it for the kid and they love it i am also a prime member a well there are so many great thing for member movie apps game and show that are free if you are looking for a simple tablet to help occupy some free time look into one
had the fire stick but i just bought a k tv and upgraded the netflix to stream k loved the fire stick so much only made sense to buy the fire tv box it is super easy to use great interface
fun to use but not fun with the software i tried forever to get it to regnize my light module to turn the lamp on and off i gave up if they ever fix the software it would be great other than that it is nice to ask alexa thing and play music speaker is good amazon echo software need a lot of improvement
the earlier model were so simple to use no nonsense listing of book in it is library by author or title now there are big picture with tiny lettering and lot of ad
this is not going to mpare to a galaxy tab or ipad but it is a good starter tablet for my nephew i hate the ad that pop up on the screen and wish amazon would have mentioned that
i have been using amazon fire product for almost a year when they first came out and the nd generation fire tv box is much faster it is easy to use and i can access all my favorite streaming video apps and amazon prime service are great there is so much ntent available with this device now adding alexa integrates with the alexa app on my phone i can see my shopping list which me in handy
i wa surprised on how easy it wa to use i bought it for my mother and she totally love it and i do too
the amazon fire is a great tablet and it is very easy to use
excellent product with decent sound and form factor
the kindle paperwhite is easy to use and great for reading outdoors
purchased for my year old love that it me with kindle freetime which is almost on it is own it is perfect for curious finger prone to swiping and clicking wherever since the parental ntrols lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile our first unit had an issue after updating the o but amazon is amazing and exchanged the device no question asked i would have gone through best buy but our local one didnhave the pink one in stock anymore i would have preferred that it didnme with a camera or microphone for privacy reason my older kid year old kindle fire hds do not have a camera or microphone all in all it is a great device for little one but definitely enough power and feature to grow with them
i am still learning this product a it doe not me with instruction direction and is trial and error process however i am pleased with what i do know about this product and the performance that i am getting out of it
understand me very well use it to turn on liights open the gargae etc
bought a ipad alternative for child and for reading and game play kid had ipad mini that both had charging port failure requiring stly repair replacement easy to use light weight and portable without the worry of significant replacement st associated with ipad
this is a great product send one i purchase remend it
my yo daughter love to read and watch certain show on netflix a well a amazon prime she is le interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you side load the google play app which for the casual person is more technical that you would like
this is a great tablet for my young son he is able to order book for school he play game and he is able to go onto youtube for the fraction of an ipad it is great
granddaughter christmas gift she love it the external micro sd slot enables her to download a bunch of stuff
i like u can add more memory it is faster then the st gen picture quality is even better
this product is great for reading you the news a book or the weather alexa is great at setting timer and alarm and telling silly joke if you ask alexa a google type question such a what wa the sre to such and such llege basketball game most time she cannot answer even if you pose the question a number of way sometimes you can ask a question differently from the way you would intuitively ask a question and alexa will answer this prof frustrating to me it is a very expensive gadget that your phone can easily do with a few keystroke i am nsidering returning it and purchasing the google product to see if there is an improvement
i buy kindle fire for my grandchild they are between the age of to year old they seem kid friendly and easy to use

this is a great tablet for an affordable price ha most of the functionality you would get with a high end tablet with expandable memory access your book browse web email etc nice screen resolution no issue with it thus far

overall it not bad i like all that it offer i just wish it wa not so finicky you ask it a question and will say hmm i do not have the answer to that and then ask it the same question again just slightly different it is is able to answer none the le it a good buy
would not remmend to anybody i had to take it back three time and still would not hook up to tv very poor customer service
looking for a streaming medium box this is a fine android based one it ha an ethernet port stream doe p amazon and if you have all android stuff it is fine i really do not like that it doe not have a volume ntrol the only difference between this and the fire stick for me is the internal storage capacity and the ethernet port so but two fire stick instead of one box unless you want to play the apps
i think that the size and the display a perfect for reading
we got a great holiday deal on this tablet the set up wa easy and it made a great gift
have not used it much but so far i like it mostly use to play game on
bought this tablet for a child at christmas after day of research this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot it had a good processor decent memory and good review it should be exactly what a year old would need in a tablet at a great price
had been looking at this item on amazon and hoped it would go in sale it did and i wa able to purchase at best buy
we are very happy with our new alexa product we are so happy that we have been calling our daughter daily with new idea on how to use it this ha prompted her purchase one a well
this kindle is alot larger and better for viewing

i used a nook reader for several year but got no customer service when i needed anything the kindle customer service is truly first class and the reader is a quality item
work well and look great for kid limited internet access though
this is good for beginner but not very good it wifi work terrible
i would enurage everyone to get this product to save on the st of cable satellite a must have
i absolutely love my kindle the battery last a really long time which is great because i read a lot easy to work and i am loving the adjustable back light
fun and informative very handy great sound worth the price
the tablet seems to work well not a fast a some but not bad i found it wa not a easy to find an antivirus product to work with the fire a it wa for other android product i will use this tablet for reading book instead of surfing the web
excedes my expections is easy to use and amazon sends me e mail keeping me informed of thing that echo can do which i find very helpful
i have had other device like this this one by far is the best no glitch or buffering
removed from the box and put the device immediately into operation
gave this a a gift to my sister family they love it my brother in law is not a mputer user so he love just being able to ask question instead of having to google thing
great tablet so far i bought it a a gift andhave heard no mplaints
it is small enough to carry along on my daily routine the price wa right too
awesome product it look great better than the picture it doe what say and more very happy with the purchase
great tablet for the entire family and very easy to use
i really love this tablet for my toddler the only thing i have against it are that there is no kickstand on it it may lag at time and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie cannot be exited other than that it is a great tablet
alexa is great addition to our kitchen still exploring all she can do easy set up through android
the fire is a good deal for the amount of money it st simple to use and ha a nice screen display
a great e reader have had no problem with it at all
expandable memory up to gb amazon kindle prime benefit small portable option with stylish accessory from a name brand a opposed to some unknown chinese alternative i choose amazon everyday of every week at this price point
great tablet my son love it and everything about it he love playing the game and this tablet is very very fast
we wanted an additional easily portable tablet for our family the omnipresent advertising is annoying but also easy to just ignore for buck this is a great way to have an additional e reader browser streaming and gaming device
have owned the kindle keyboard nd generation paperwhite and now the oasis i love the oasis very much the ergonomic design is wonderful and make it a breeze to hold it is so light that is the biggest killer feature of the oasis the led look fantastic and i love the return of page button i have never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great all in all this is easily the best kindle ever made and even though it is a bit spendy it will be the one future kindles are measured against
we are very much enjoying our echo our grand child do too alexa answer all sort of question for u and we particularly enjoy the music we request we have an app downloaded on our tablet so we can listen to podcasts and radio station too it is great
alexa is pretty awesome and the speaker really bump
i have had it with high cable bill and wa looking for an inexpensive alternative several of my friend told me about the amazon firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable tv bill i even had to be reminded that if you are a prime customer you get the amazon channel at no additional st with all the free channel amazon firebox provides being an amazon prime customer add even more channel to choose from and offer movie tv show etc now to be fair itâ is not cable i miss cable but i donâmiss those high cable bill you can also link your netflix hulu and other acunts to your amazon firebox making it the only place for home entertainment although you have to keep an eye on the premium channel offering free day trial and remember to put a security de on your remote in order to avoid guest kid and other person from ordering a bunch of the pay channel provided on amazon firebox other than that i am one happy customer
cant believe we waited to buy one love how easy it is to use and the interaction with all my device
yes perfect for a bonus room can have netflix and movie all at the same time
good sound quality and a nice selection of skill that it can learn including radio show
i wa reluctant to buy this product out of fear of it not being used a it turn out my daughter and i use it nstantly so much in fact we now have an echo in each of our bedroom a well to help with studying and for music excellent product
wa a late christmas gift to myself updated from the paperwhite and the difference is very noticeable
i loved everything about my kindle paperwhite but then while reading the other night i swiped to turn the page and nothing happened it froze after using it for about two year give or take a uple of month i have tried restarting it but it doe not shut off i advise you also buy the extended two year warranty or just go back to reading real book
i really wanted to buy this kindle paperwhite and i cannot be happier i would definitely remmend to anyone wanting for a e book reader really nice product really love it
love my new alexa sooo easy to use and so many apps to program for her the best purchase i have made in a very long time
this is not a bad product amazon offer great product but this tablet wa missing feature even for a basic tablet the lack of google chrome mpatibility made this tablet not right for me
this tablet is good for the price just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay amazon there are other tablet available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in amazon product or service if you are looking for an android tablet will be disappointed this tablet ha an android operating system but it is not available due to the amazon operating system overriding it the screen resolution is average if you are an amazon user this is a good tablet otherwise look elsewhere
i love my kindle black i can read for hour without making my eye sore the way a phone screen would the function are easy to use everything is set up clearly and simply it is shape is adorable and it is surprisingly light the battery doe last a long time

i bought the device for my grand baby and they absolutely love it my son say they pretty much have not put it down since christmas and i may need to buy another one so they do not have to share
after reading the review it is an awesome gadget added to the llection
if you are an amazon prime member this tablet work well it is designed so you have easy access to prime book amazon music
wife had the earlier version without the light this one doe the joband let me go to sleep while she read best money i ever spent to get out of the dog house
in my honest opinion spend the extra money on the firetv and directly connect it to your router if you have brighthouse internet then you ll understand why their hardware nstantly ha wifi issue so much happier that this plug directly into the router and my streaming is no longer interrupted
i have to remember alexa is not google but she doe know a lot and cannotell you a joke if you ask her i use her for timer working out alarm clock and to tell me the weather on a daily base the degree speaker sound is a plus a well when i m streaming pandora
i bought this because my ipad th gen gave up on me and it a waste of money to buy a new one so i got this amazon kindle fire for it a good deal for a replacement so i do not have to use my phone to check my email
purchased this tablet for a gift they love it easy to use
it is a pretty good device but still ha some issue with voice regnition
if you stream everyday it is worth the investment for the k box v the fire stick more powerful more storage more time to watch with le loading time
my daughter enjoys her tablet reading the book for school screen size is prefect
i love this kindle the price is good not too heavy and i charge once every two week
i broke my kindle voyage after almost two year my heart wa a broken a the glass ver after looking at the latest line of kindles i decided to try the latest paperwhite a it had the same screen resolution and wa a lot cheaper plus a white model to match my other white silver gadget it doe have a few le led for backlighting no flush glass ver but that is what broke no auto adjusting light that never quite worked anyway squeezy side and a tiny bit heavier bigger than the voyage the voyage also ha had no hardware update since it wa released and the new crazy expensive kindle u leather and ha no not leather option for people who do not like their high tech wrapped in animal skin so instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone i sprung for the paperwhite i have been using this for about a month and the quality ha impressed me i do not miss the glass ver a much a i thought i would although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out the screen is great doe not clash with the white casing and although not quite a even a backlight a the voyage still much better value for what you get the software is essentially the same and amazon ha been slowly improving kindle software for all the recent model if you like amazon for book i highly remmend this kindle you cannot beat it for price value and it really doe not feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your book
it is a great product to have loud speaker however if you do not have any accessory to go with it do not buy it but if you have the money buy it
we do not have one mplaint we are very satisfied
work very well gave for gift would remmend buying this
she love it it work really well and it feature are amazing
this is a great starter tablet easy to use and mpact
a little more mplicated than my original kindle but i like it
bought for mom love it dependable and tough enough dropped time and not a scratch great item
i use the device to watch movie and my son watch youtube on for his alphabet
in the world of voice assistant the amazon echo doe stand out a i love the device
i currently have it connected to my xbox via tv in used mainly for youtube netflix amazon etc device is easy to use and quick setup the alexa integration is also a great feature when i m feeling lazy and want to speak mmands into ntroller if your looking for a great streaming device this is a great one to ownpro easy setupapp store choicesability to side load appsalexa integrationn sometimes drop wifi connectivity forcing to restart device apps crash not frequent
excellent love it work great love design wonderful
bought this for my wife and she love it definitely worth it
i wa quite disappointed when i began working through the menu and disvered that my year old roku wa far more intuitive roku also allows search of all of your subscribed service if i am already paying a subscription fee to netflix or hbo now and i can watch a tv show or movie without additional st why should i pay amazon to watch it i am a fan of amazon service and a prime member but i also do not want to throw my money away roku is still the best
i got this tablet on a deal and ha good quality of video you can watch
alexa is the most useful product i have purchased my husband is handicapped and home all day while i work he asks alexa to put the light on for him and she doe he ask her to tell him a joke and she doe anything he want to know he turn to alexa
just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read book magazine etc but for such a low price wa surprised at the total capability available
this an amazing device must have for prime member
so i pretty much got this a a cheap tablet for my year old he is nstantly snagging people is cell phone to play game we figured this wa inexpensive enough that if he break out in the next two year it is still better than if he break one of our phone on contact overall it is a great little tablet for the money and we can set parental ntrols on it so it can grow with him over the next few year not bad
this wa perfect for my year old she get all the apps she want and it work great even dropped it a uple time and it l still in one piece
still learning to use the echo my new friend alexa is very informative and fun great sound too
bought it for my mom and she love it easy to use
this device is pretty no frill but for a year old boy it work great and is awesome it is sturdy play apps well and i do not have to freak out every time he drop it i m sure it will break eventually my son will find a way but for i ll take my chanes
i recently purchased this amazon fire for my daughter i like that it ha the little accent of a night light so if we are watching a movie in the dark she can still use it without illuminating the entire room feature are average just like any other tablet it is a little bulky but for a child it get the job done pretty sturdy when it dropped doesnt have much storage but the good news is you can add your own sd to create more storage
hard to figure out look like a nice piece of furniture right now but it is really hard to determine how to use it
we have enjoyed alexa she will play song for u give u information and even tell joke
grandson used a borrowed one at school so now ha his own
this wa a gift for a family i adopted it wa a great gift and they loved it
easy to use for a beginner this is my first tablet and i thought i d have to take advantage of the free setup but i didni love being able to take it with me so i can read while waiting place and not have to carry two book if i m close to the end of one i also love the camera my personal camera wa always low on battery power but now i cannotake my kindle fire with me and take photo when ever i want
best box really like it so far and having k is nice
i bought this for my grandmother and she cannot put it down
i am having a lot of fun with the amozon echo there is so much to learn i get email letting me know what she ha learned and up date the sound wa really amazing for something so small
my son love his kindle fire tablet it is perfect
the product is good and easy to operate i guarantee that you wonregret buying it
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky turn out a uple of system reset and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one she get the new one but i can highly remmend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent
the echo wa super easy to set up and start using the whole family love using the echo from playing music to getting trivia and a ton of other thing
great quality great movie the amazon fire stick in the amazon box is the best thing i ever had
good product for this price i like my amazon fire tablet gb black
it is got a few glitch in the system but overall it is so great not having to deal with any cable mpany i have got everything i need all in this neat little package
this is my first e reader and i generally like it the lit screen is bigger and make it readable in a wide variety of lightning the text is crisp and easy to read i m very accustomed to using inch tablet so a screen feel a little small but it if sufficient when you are just reading and not looking for new book
it is worked well great value for the price good speed overall a good bang for the buck
i bought it to replace my fire stick and to get surround sound but it didndo that but still decided to keep it
great price for product category doe what it is supposed to
i love the tablet it wa for a gift but i have purchased a few of them
so far a few not so great thing modt of them managed to resolve them though
excellent partner my daily assistance on all aspect of living
this is a gift for my son which he loved good for a music lover
this kindle fire is lighter than my old one the speed is great all apps load very quickly i also like that it me in different lors
it ha everything we need so cable is not needed in this house
picked this up for my wife wanted a spare tablet for watching some random show and do some book rental reading from amazon is a price that cannot be beat wish i would of picked it up on black friday a it wa only the tablet ha a single speaker it loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room also ha a mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphone or use bluetooth screen resolution is very good for a budget screen nothing high def hd but for the screen size it is very good if you me from a higher end android or ipad you may be disappointed at first with the screen however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the tablet echelon it entry level for both amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablet it a tablet that run almost everything fire o is very similar to android o extremely simple and easy to use you can make multiple logins on this device so kid have their own screen and apps or make a guest acunt to be able to pa the fire tab to another person without having access to your information perfect for sharing battery life is great last about day with moderate use email and web surfing with brightness on gb internal memory is not enough for more than or book and a few apps highly remmend getting a gb micro sd card to expand the storage it doe me with unlimited amazon cloud storage for photo and music camera on the fire tab is good for well lit area no flash on the camera but you can snap away photo and auto upload backup to your amazon cloud drive also me with a trial of amazon prime would definitely buy again
i got one for my wife since several of our friend have one and they spoke highly of it it is sometimes hit and miss with alexa but overall it is nice to have something that can set timer for the kid play music and a the software improves i can see this being even better the integration of the skill and functionality uld certainly improve but overall it is one of those nvenience thing that you can live without it but it sure is nice since we have a bunch of kid we have elected to turn off the online ordering just to be on the safe side
my wife love the echo she listens to her music everyday
doe everything you need the price is a good a can be expected
feature are similar to my fire and this upgrade is good i wish it wa lighter in weight although i enjoy the larger screen
make accessibility to lighting and music very easy enjoying learning all the alexa can do
i do not like this tablet a android is not working well
serf it purpose for the price would much rather have the ipad for ease of use but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken
wag glad i purchased the amazon echo easy to set up and link with the two ipads in our home use it to play music from itunes a well a the ipad let is me do a quick check on the weather and a joke of the day impressed at how sensitive it is a i can speak with it from anywhere in my ndo every with background noise heartily remmend it to my friend and family
bought this with a dot and we love these so easy to play music and set alarm and other ol thing this doe love this and highly remmend for house
i love love my amazon fire tv it wa super easy to set up and get going i have access to even more than i thought i would so easy to use and we have had no problem at all i cannot remmend this enough
this is a great little tablet i find it is about the same size a the ipad mini for a fraction of the st lot of free apps and really nice graphic
i bought this tablet on black friday when it wa on special for my little girl i wa not expecting much from the tablet boy wa i surprised by it capability love the tablet
love the tablet they are a good deal for the money my grandson love it
the fire tv itself is great for streaming various medium over our wireless network to our tv in our sun room at first we thought we d have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything run pretty smoothly the application are fast and responsive and the menu are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house the only thing we are not happy with is that the remote chew through battery pretty quickly i have a logitech harmony remote that ha a lcd screen on it and it doe not go through battery a fast the fire tv remote we now remove the battery whenever the remote is not in operation an annoyance but not a deal breaker
good product it is easy to use and it organized item very good
this paperwhite is just the right size a many paperback but thinner can read in any light work a advertised
i bought the echo for my bedroom but moved it more central to the house so that i uld use it more it is super nvenient to be able to just say something out loud and have her take note of what you need from playing alt nation on sirius xm to setting a timer to needing the weather at a vacation destination alexa always ha the answer my only mplaint is that when i have music playing loudly alexa doe not respond to turning off but it is such a minor issue the music quality is unreal from such a small unit i m definitely buying more for around the house
great gift for mom she love to read and now can ntinue to do so in more place
i know my granddaughter will love it she ha an older one that wa given to her
upgraded to this from the fire tv stick it is twice a powerful than the stick i liked it a lot and got of my worker on them and they love it great for travel a dorm room for not paying on extra cable satellite box and their monthly vig
this is a great tablet i bought it for my daughter and it is very easy for her to use
i have watched about to movie and have not experience any buffering or freeze
easy to use and update great for kid and adult alike
perfect size able to slip in pocket nice feel battery last long clear screen however if you read quickly if may find yourself sometimes when scrolling to next page more slow or you may flip and skip over page if pressed lightly
this tablet ha great graphic mpared to the base android i bought the kid protective case to use when the grandkids me over long battery life
if you want a low budget tablet this is the one do not be scared
since this is an android based tablet i sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same a an android tablet with google play store etc the screen resolution speaker ram are just only adequate otherwise a good cheap tablet really need to ponder it utility before buying it
it cheap and on black friday i got it even cheaper it not a mpetitor for ipad but i do pretty basic thing on my new kindle tablet so i am ok with this purchase nothing that impressed me
definitely got the job done this tablet is nice size and affordable
this is my third i buy them for all my grandkids
i wa looking for a product that wa affordable and easy to use this wa the perfect product
a kindle that ha a case to help with drop purchased on sale during black friday great deal on a great product
i bought it a a gift for my husband and he love it the picture quality the non glare is his favorite
perfect for downloading and reading book perfect size and ha a nice bright screen
i love the fire stick and this is definitely the top dog very fast
amazon did it again alexa is awesome and ntrols my light music can ask her question and work great with iftt
i got it because it wa smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire it is not a easy to operate a the original kindle fire
i bought three and everyone loved it it wa a pain in the neck to set up with the wifi more than a handful of time i had to look up in the net and resolve the issue i learned i needed to change the password for it on occasion wifi need to be rebooted but all in all when is not having issue connecting it is a wonderful product you just have to be patient at time
this wa a gift for my sister she never had a reader or tablet now she ha both easy to use nice size for traveling great price
work great
i ended up getting this fire for on black friday for my youngest son great price and great product easy to use and set up
one of the best item i have bought just wonderful we use it all the time
the kindle paperweight is a nice sized tablet good for reading in any lighting you re able to see it in the bright sun light a well a the dim lit room
perfect mpact and powerful the amazon fire tv is an amazing piece of hardware
the paperwhite is wonderful the functionality is great battery life is awesome and is so much better than trying to read a book on my phone remmend to anyone who love to read especially at night very easy on the eye
i use amazon for everyday purchase and am a member of amazon prime this tablet is extremely fast and seems to me to be very well built i am now thinking about retiring my nook lor that i have been using for a very long time
this my nd kindle i am so happy with it the price wa right and i uld not resist buying another
great
awesome product lightweight and easy to carry love it
amazon fire stick is perfect for anything we play the game stream movie and i like listening to pandora music it all in one
had a first generation nook this wa way more than i wa expecting plus the prime membership is worth it just for shipping
we are used to ipads in our house this ha taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format but it work great the price point is perfect for kid to use without the worry
work very well for child and people of all age
i bought this tablet because i didnwant to spend over a on a tablet that would not get much use i use it mostly to read book and article online it ha a brightness reducing function which is really great
read kindle book daily and had been utilizing my iphone and ipad to read but neither of these are nducive to reading in the sunlight so i bought myself an early christmas present and love the ease of use and the ability to read while outside in the bright sunlight worth every penny
i live these slowly replacing dot in our large room with echo the sound quality is close to a nose system
i would remmend this product to anyone on a budget or who want something bigger than an iphone for searching purpose it doe everything my iphone doe but i wanted a tablet for reading spotify netflix and just the ease of a bigger screen buck why not
we really find alexa very intuitive and work with ease would remmend to others
great product purchased for my elderly parent very user friendly and inexpensive
love the apps of this device many hour of enjoyment for my son nice size for him to watch video and learn a well
delivery wa fast the tablet ha been good my grandson love the sport apps
i have a uple of these along with a uple of firesticks work good with the kodi app
great all around product sleek and doe it job since purchased i have not looked back
the echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you ll want them for all over your house
what is not to like this thing doe it all if you are a trivia buff you will be occupied for hour so much info in a small cylinder with a tiny footprint it is unobtrusive fit in with any der keep the grandkids busy for hour what will they think up next it is already been replaced by a similar unit with a screen the look it performs a they say with enough microphone that can hear across a loud room the speaker are good but do not expect to be blown away my advice find it on a big sale and enjoy
this product requires significantly le buffering than the fire stick for sure would remmend over the fire stick if you are planning on using this for streaming especially for movie or live tv this product also inrporates alexa so you can ntrol your smart home from the mfort of your uch
work very well it is fast and responsive when i saw that it is quad re and ha micro sd card i snapped it up and uld not be happier with it
many of our question to her she miss interpreted or replied a not understanding what we were looking for distance for her to hear u wa minimal i returned this one and purchased the google and this one is much better and more knowledgeable with answer both device remmend using the phone app and also making other purchase for more usage of item that may be available i didnexpect additional charge and so i m not to thrilled with either one but i did keep the google device in hope of better to me in the future
work great great buy would not have anything else
i got this for my son to play game on soi uld get my ipad back personally i think it is a great little tablet for kid and or for reading other then that it is not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lot of storage on but it work for what it is intended for andi have no problem
would purchase again great product it is easy to install you tube wa very helpful to me with the installation of my amazon fire stick
this is the ideal tablet for my year old girl
this is a great gift idea for the person who is hard to buy for got it for my dad for his birthday and he really love it overall it is a unique item that i would remmend for tech loving or even not tech loving people it is user friend just simply talk
my son told me about this product and spoke highly so we purchased for grandchild very satisfied
bought this for my step daughter she loved it go everywhere with it
bought this to use with my kindle voyage and i love it it charge my kindle in hour or le sometimes and the battery last for week
i love my fire hd i got it because my kindle the original that my husband bought me died and the verizon tablet wa not working great for me so i came down and the agent at store showed me this one there is a learning curve but it get better and take a while to learn but i love it
i have been using a kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one a a birthday present very excited recipient
got this when it wa on sale which is what really made it worth getting
very smooth and easy to use i would buy another
we like the fire better than roku we also prefer the ease of use over the funtionality of our new sony k tv
doe exactly what i wanted highly remmend for an inexpensive travel reader
one of the thing i love the most about my new kindle is it is size it slide so nicely into my mpact purse protective case and all another thing i have noticed is the lack of glare that i experienced with my old kindle it automatically adjusts to the light and i m looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle i also love the battery life it go on forever the case i bought make it possible to stand my kindle up in front of me and read while i m eating a must for me i never eat alone
echo or alexa from amazon is smart and learns along with you she is a nice gift for teen a well a senior it is the kind of thing you might think you didnwant or need until you get it and begin to use it we like the sound quality of the speaker
kindle is always the first choice to read the e book mfortable reading experience
the version with the light is the way to go a case is a must the screen can easily be scratched over work a intended
i like it a lot got it just to be able to get on line while husband wa on the laptop but there is so much more very user friendly a few basic direction and you breeze through most set ups i can check the breaking news weather or look up an address etc be out the door meanwhile the laptop is still booting the fire shut down moko case is merely shutting the ver weak spot for listening to music ha rather poor sound but movie show voice etc are clear fine will be getting the fire stick shortly no opinion on camera video yet
best and least expensive tablet you can find great for movie apps and game perfect for kid
very satisfied with the kindle paperwhite reader the single issue i have is that i would like to have the capability to do reverse ntrast not a deal breaker for me thought
got this at a great price a a send tablet the battery life is so good that i use when traveling for movie watching great screen and quick response time
the best of the streaming box i have used all of the major brand and like the fire tv the best
i wa tired of trying to read my book on my regular kindle fire or my phone and never being able to do so because the screen wa too dark or glare wa to strong this is my rd kindle and i love it the best perfect indoors or outdoors small and mpact fit easily in my purse or tote
this reader is everything i hoped for this price range
i wa not expecting how great this product is it wa really easy to use and install
i wa surprised at every thing this little fire stick uld do
bought of these for my grand child and they love them
mments on kindle paperwhite basic functioning of page forward back excellent footnote action often led to loosing place it wa easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back pressing the top right â xâ sometimes returned to text but often wa dead requiring selecting â go to footnotesâ picking the rrect footnote returned to rrect position but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote send me off to wrong text position while doing thing right raise no problem it is to easy to get in trouble enabling the â xâ at all time would be safer occasionally a small print message such a â highlightersâ would appear between the line supposed to show where other kindle user highlighted text doe not highlight any text

mpletely satisfied with the amazon fire tv i ll never go back to cable tv again
this wa my first kindle wonderful reading device
i bought this for my mom who is a first time tablet user it is easy to use and i love that fact that i did not spend a fortune to get her started
gift for great nephew have that are and y o both love these tablet because each got one play with them a much a mom allows
i installed a driver for google play store also i payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ad it wa worth it i use this thing alot
the tablet uld be great for my year old daughter if it worked properly a of right now i need to return it to see if a new one will work there are black and grey line across the screen most of the time it will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it i am hoping a new one will not be faulty
our first tablet purchased for my husband prior to a long train trip downloaded movie had internet and wa great for traveling
i love my amazon echo there are so many apps and thing you can do to make life easier highly remmend checking out the echo
i thought i would get the fire a a back up tab for my grand daughter well in my opinion it is a little more nfusing to navigate around than just a plain android tablet so if like me you are an android lurana this is a bit different to operate
great for reading watching movie using on the go
i love it would remmend to a friend have fun with family asking question and great with music
it is great i am an apple and amazon user and it work for many device that are not yet mpatible with apple product
my wife really enjoys the amazon fire ha very good picture quality very easy to figure out how to use because it similar to our smart phone
love the tablet wonderful battery life great for movie
alexa is a very good product great speaker volumne for lidten to music and a lot of apps for it
purchased several tablet for the child for gift easy to use hang the kid love them my only mplaint is that the charger uld be more durable
best buy always ha an awesome variety of great movie product to choose from to buy everything that i have bought from best buy is always the best always ha satisfied me with no mplaints i use to have an ipad i switched to the kindle fire because of the smaller screen easier to carry with me to use pretty much everywhere i go
it work great for netflix and amazon streaming i love these box
the only thing that i didnlike wa that i had to sign up with amazon prime in order for my son to get unlimited game i ended up paying a little bit more
i have purchased several kindle fire over the year for kid and family member and am always very happy with the product the new lower price just make them more appealing
what can i say the amazon fire is a great tablet the price is fantastic good size doe the job great deal at best buy
text is very crisp and easy to read would remmend to others
i got it for my brother and he loved it he loved how small the box is and how it doe not take to much space
this new technology doe what it is intended to do my kid love it they talk to alexa every day listen to music and even ask homework question
kindle fire is a great affordable tablet ha everthing i need
neat device play music with decent audio and allows me to ntrol my wemo device
work great uld not be happier put out great sound
who is an fanboy and now he will more than likely trash this when the homepod arrives yay
after careful review i have decided to reward my son with a kindle paperwhite for his birthday he ha a new dell lap top and sometimes u a mini ipad but he really wanted a kindle of his own i think he enjoys downloading his book to read for school and for leisure
it is super easy to set daily limit and goal for child on the device remember to set up amazon household which make installing apps via site easier ha everything a typical android tablet ha
love this device easy to set up and fun to use highly remmend
the best kindle that i ever had it is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book great for indoor and outdoor reading
loved my amazon echo had to get one for each of my family member too
i love the echo but you need one in every room to ntrol thing from everywhere in a big house the speaker accessory to put in other room is only available through amazon and is still on back order
had to get a few inexpensive tablet for my kid so far and the battery life on this is great speed of apps is good a well
a a full time student i wanted a budget tablet that would let me read pdf file open class note and powerpoint presentation i got the fire when it wa on sale for it doe what i wanted and more i use it for class and to kill time between class with game movie and youtube battery will last two day of nstant use the size is perfect and fit my pant pocket back overall great buy only downfall is the volume to my headphone i found it to be quite low but for the price good enough
it is very simple to set up on your tv we were going to run a cable to the other tv in the bedroom but it wa le money to purchase the fire stick
loved the voice search easy to install and very easy to use
i bought this after already having a fire stick and this outperforms it
we love the amazon echo free music product review weather
so happy we made the decision to cut the rd and move to amazon tv
bought this for my aunt and she love it so much she u it everyday and say it very easy to use
i love this echo when i need to remember something i tell echo to do it for me
the portability is nice but miss key element from the other two sound is good but this unit doe not allow for the new peak in feature or allow you to add this speaker to play music all thru the house
i do like the amazon tv idea i do miss my dvr i also miss all of the live tv ability though until amazon tv get live tv ability this only get star work well easy connect but there are alot of reason to miss cable tv the channel selection need to improve
the amazon echo is their response to siri in stereo it ha terrific voice regnition and nstantly learns new thing the only shortming is that it doe not play nicely with itunes
i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light ntrols and so much more love the product
i know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet but it is the best bargain at this price point the screen is okay if you just read book news or surf the website but if you want to enjoy video this is not your choice the processor is slow and the amazon app store doe not have all the apps like you d expect from google appstore even though the o based on android but few tweak let you install the google playstore search online for the step overall i m satisfied with my purchase hope this is helpful

work just a advertised easy to set up find music with ease
it is easy and intuitive the only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application instead of watching an advertisement then having to figure out how to exit it
my wife love it and it is a lot of fun the music is great and it is amazing how much alexa understands
excellent bargain and work for all purpose that a tablet is needed for

me alexa right this review for me alex write your own review me i guess alexa cannot do everything or maybe she just chooses not to hmmmmm
great tablet light small and inexpensive for entry level nsumers that have an amazon prime acunt mbined with the amazon free ntent to prime member book movie game and amazon underground this tablet is on fire plus easy on the wallet should something bad happens to it
i purchased for a year old perfect buy she loved it
i would remmend this item who like watching current tv and movie and also the archived show movie
christmas present for a year old showed her once how to turn it on how to charge and how to get to the various apps she is totally capable of operating the device on her own so easy breezy a year old can use it independently
doe all of the basic and then some a lot more than i expected from a unit
it is the best choice for to leave home or with friend
such a great tablet got my mother it for christmas and she love it
this tablet is a well made tablet be sure to get a sd card a the memory is not great the amazon underground with totally free game and apps is worth the purchase alone you do not need amazon prime subscription service to enjoy this little tablet go on and purchase one for you wont regret the purchase
i love it and i m i m not using even a quarter of alexa is capability the thing that i love the most so far is the shopping list feature if i take something out of the fridge that i need to restock i just ask alexa to add it to my shopping list then it on my phone when i go to the store no stopping in the middle of a recipe to find my phone to add the item also work great with pandora radio if a song that i do not know is playing and i want to know the name and artist i can either ask alexa or look at the app on my phone looking forward to learning more about what she can do
i have wanted a kindle reader for a few year now i m so happy to finally have one it is so nvenient easy to hold most importantly it is easy on the eye even when i do not have my glass
i really liked the many facet of the tablet presence of alexa doe provide opportunity for adult to play and surprise by it the only caveat is amazon free time is for only year which amazon should increase by atleast year for prime member but thats more of service and no mplains on tablet
excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading material along when traveling
this thing is pretty freakin ol it is a gadget but a useful one it is literally siri for the house ask it anything and get the answer or just listen to any type of music in great sound quality awesome little thing
got them on every tv in the house fast internet is all you need
the tablet is easy to set up and easy to use great tablet for family use
bought this tablet for our family to use doe a great job and my son u it for video and game and school apps the parental ntrols were a little difficult and time nsuming to set up but other than that it ha been great i would definately buy again
this thing is better then the built in apps of my samsung k tv it fast and awesome
i am not very tech savvy this table ha been very user friendly i have called for support the staff were very helpful
the fire tv is a wonderful device i have the stick and i think that the tv is much better
i love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging rd is already loose
this kindle fire tablet wa a christmas gift the recipient is over joyed thus far
amazon make great tablet and this is at a great price
alexa ha been a great addition to our household she is simple to connect and easy to use we use her daily to keep u informed about current event enjoy her music and have connected several devise to her to make our house smarter
great purchase quick speed lot of choice to watch and cheap
good beginner tablet for older person who like surf internet
i found the echo easy to use just wished it had a wireless version
this is just a good for many of the everyday type stuff a the ipad but at a fraction of the price the only thing that i would change is making the volume louder
this kindle is the right size for travel yet large enough to read love all the feature and price
the best reader out there however do not expect to use this tablet for it web browser function look strange seeing paper version of website a the paper white feature cannot be turned off
i am enjoying this tablet i m sure there are more advanced tablet available but with the price and the certificate it wa practically free this is my first electronic item with a touch screen and it fun i m still learning how to use all the feature i would remmend it to a friend but i think it already being replaced with the next generation
the fire tv box simply doe it all very fast and fun to use
upgraded from an original kindle absolutely love it even better than my wife is kindle paperwhite
it is just an average tablet bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
i used to avoid dragging along book magazine to read a they are bulky and heavy but now i do not need to i just download my reading material
love it it doe all i need and then some great price and great feature
next generation of kindle with more storage allows the kid to download and play the favorite game
bought amazon fire tablet on black friday and the family love it
bought this for my yr old she doe everything on it tech savy son set up parental limit on tablet love that it doe run kind of slow when trying to watch a movie
this is a well built great sounding unit that get better the more you use it
i purchased this because i previously ha the kindle paperwhite but it had died being kind of limited on fund but needed a kindle due to all the book i read i opted for the fire i love it i m able to see the vers which entice me to purchase book so i remember book easier than before i also can do more thing on the fire and the price is le than the paper white kindle
the echo is used all day long alexa responds to an amazing number of request one item of ncern is the grandkids mmands to alexa need to figure a way to block kid
it wa a gift for my year old mother and she wa able to learn how to use it fairly quickly
what a ol gadget great to have by the pool and change music without getting out
love how you can ask her to do a lot including light and camera super fun my grandkids love it too
allow me to preface this with a little history i am wa a casual reader who owned a nook simple touch from i have read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key title fair to say my nook did not get a much use a many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindle paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindle but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindle the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindle you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger game trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the nook that hindered me for the past year i wa never inspired to pick it up get it into my hand and just dive in there wa never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply adore my kindle if you are nsidering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded book and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left a well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you
this is a great tablet with all the access you need it ha a decent resolution and can be used to play game connect on social medium listen to music and watch movie
it is white and it is much better than kindle so paperwhite is a very good product
this this my th one purchased my granddaughter is in kindergarten and it a good learning tool
quick starting and easy to use this tablet is great for travel and game at night e mail check are a snap low st make it something you do not need to worry about even support e print to my hp printer buy and enjoy it no downside found yet
i bought one for my boyfriend and one for his son it is fast and easy to use
he is a wizard with mputers and tablet and know much more than me
the supplied amazon bluetooth remote ntrol will not pair back with the main unit this is the send one i bought with the same issue re pairing the remote is quite simple per the instruction but to no avail had to use a android remote with a usb dongle to operate the unit going through battery like crazy trying to get it to pair back up no more than three inch from main unit
work good
our son just life this unit he ha all his favorite game on it
my daughter love it keep the kid occupied i would remmend to anyone with kid
great stuff to have it is a good tool to help your kid go out and find knowledge and this doe help wanting knowledge should still be enurage
bought it for my nephew and he loved it great purchase
i love being able to read on the tablet and not have to use the battery on my telephone
battery seems to die fast but that is my only mplaint
i wa somewhat skeptical about getting this tablet and especially for that low of a price but no later than week i went back and purchased another one for my wife this amazon kindle fire is awesome
while i put sonos throughout my home i chose alexa for in my shop i spend a lot of time with my hand full or dirty and it is great to play music or interact with alexa apps and not stop what i am doing
much better resolution than previous version and easier to use
you cant download too many apps so would remmend for the average reader
excellent product i have purchased several yes child can break them if they try i am sure there are limitation a it is an amazon product star my family doe all they want with theirs and are very happy we have mine is a year old and work like new i believe a previous model had an issue with the power rd they fixed
the touch ver from amazon ha some good and some bad property on the good side it is very light at oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of vers my kindle touch fit in very snugly with no wasted space on the negative side it look and feel rather plasticky i ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer vers are a shiny black leather at first i thought the back exterior wa simply black plastic and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather a the front ver the front inner ver is a soft felt the inner body where the kindle sits is plastic there is no fastener or band to hold the ver closed this is my fourth kindle and ver the touch ver look much more like a gadget ver than the earlier one it look rather like an old palm pda ver i had or like some ipod vers the previous kindle vers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook vers right now i am having rather mixed reaction i definitely like the fact that it add so little weight to the kindle however it doe look rather cheap for i wa expecting a little more i think i am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final nclusion update november th taste will vary but in the end i decided that this wa not the right look or feel for me and i have switched to a different ver the splash safari that is similar to the old kindle ver with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap
bought a gift and have been very satisfiedgood sound and wonderful life aid
great little tablet to do what i need i mostly just surf the web and definitely use it for netflix and amazon prime big enough to be mfortable and just relaxing watching your show
really like this device helpful and fun we like the accurate data and the fun skill cannot wait to connect our light
this item is exactly what i wa looking for it is a perfect size for home or travel it is very loud for it size
great starter tablet for any nd grader on up great price
work great with good storage but lack online browsing speed
having been anticipating this purchase for a while my research wa obsessive and not in the slightest bit wa my expectation not met it is been a extension that permit info more rapidly than before with not the need for a screen to see it still not lose to explored it limit that expand quicker than i uld map figuratively love my alexa
we had a few other tablet for my wife and all were very poor we returned two and landed on this one she ha loved it so much more than the others in this price range
i have several vers from simple rubber vers to the more expanded package of hard cased plastic rubber otterbox i will keep it simple by summing up pro is and n is pro is reading mfortthis one is my favorite for when it me to reading mfort you can fold the leather ver back to have the one page feel of just the kindle in your hand or you can leave it open and then the kindle read more like an unfolded book protection on the inside and good to hold for longer period of timethe inside is soft to protect the screen and the outside is real leather which is a plus to rubber which tends to make the hand more sticky after a while the weight is neglegible the item is very light the hinge system prevents the kindle to slip out which no other ver that i know of ha elastic band keep the ver together and indicates front of the device many people have mplained before that when one open the kindle on the back unintentionally the kindle uld crack at the hinge by closing it up with the elastic band you always know where the front is so you never have this problemn is expensive that is why i bought it from overstock m from the marketplace amazon rather than new from amazon itself no total protection only an otterbox case will make sure the kindle survives a fall on the ground but for both case you still need a plastic screen ver to keep the kindle clean and untouched overall if reading mfort is firt priority and you are careful enough not to damage the kindle this is the product for you if you rather want more safety from damage or scratch go for the otterbox but then the mfortable feel will be mpromised for a more heave rubber touch
my wife and i have been rdcutting for a while with a roku tv on one tv and a p i decided to try the amazon fire tv wow this device is beyond awesome i live the alexa integration to find movie the only way it would be better is if alexa uld tune to channel on playstation vue the ability to clone my android phone to this device is great a well i would very highly remmend this device
i love the tablet hd picture is beautiful the fire tablet is very fast to load and is easy to use great tablet
the screen is absolutely amazing on the eye i can read for long stretch of time without any eye strain and the battery last forever

i dido not care for this tablet downloading apps outside of amazon wa really nfusing

i love it so and so my kid they r enjoying playing the educational game and watching cartoon
good easy to use tablet my daughter can do more with it than i can
a expected but st too much i felt amazon should have vered the failed power supply under warranty but this fixed it
very nice for light internet browsing keeping on top of email viewing video and reading e book which i like to get free from the library good browser good battery power fast charge very relaxing to sit in a mfy chair and read or browse ha given me hour of enjoyment and information for a minimal price
so far it ha been easy to use which is what i wa looking for the graphic are good and i love all of the free apps i can get the st wa great too
i wa worried about what i d be mpromising with a dollar tablet but this kindle is extraordinary for the spec yes it ha a mono speaker and it is not hd but it is a fast performing tablet and you cannot really tell i do not regret this purchase at all
it feel a bit more rugged than my original fire tablet and i believe it is an excellent value
when my old kindle died i purchased the paperwhite great for reading much lighter weight than previous one now able to read in sunlight without difficulty and am able to use with another source of light

just simply amazing i really enjoy it very impress with the sound speaker volume and it other great capability
amazon echo is a very good product for what it is supposed to do it understands what you speak and doe quite a few neat trick setting it up is quite easy even for a novice a thing to be desired is that it is not integrated with itunes and only with amazon this is a major drawback for me you can connect your device to it via bluetooth a workaround but that again is a additional process to undertake i like it though and i am sure these minor thing would be there in future
for the money good deal nice to hook up to cell phone
this device ha been an amazing addition to my entertainment system
i had an insignia tablet before they are very low on saund
i bought this to have some extra feature and mpared it to my roku stick and roku and i prefer the roku for netflix and the roku for many maybe more use friendly however if you are looking for something that can do it all with more capability and feature the fire tv win i am amazed at what i can do with this little box if you have not tried one do so
i purchased for my year old so i uld keep her off my phone but i use it also it is our first tablet it is user friendly for both myself and year old
it should be in every home very easy to use and the speaker are excellent
love it i sent one down to my family in mexi they loved it
at first i didnunderstand all the hype about alexa but then i finally gave in and decided to purchase and i am so glad i did volume go loud and she listens and responds immediately
tablet stopped working after owning for two week came back on after an hour
i bought this for my year old mother and it is great for someone who doe not do electronics well i would highly remmend it for book but there is not a lot of storage so be prepared to buy an sd card
i love my amazon echo so much that i had to buy one for work too now all my friend want one it entertains all age from kid to adult help with my book keeping and keep me up to date one the news she ha a sense of humor too ii cannot wait to have alex ntrol my electronics
it is a nice updated tablet no problem yet decent price for what you get
you cannot beat the price perfect tablet for a child
great screen and very light to hold it make reading a book effortless
even look up phone number of near by place not in my contact list
i needed to replace my old kindle reader this gave me an inexpensive reader and a tablet screen quality is not a sharp a hd and ntrast is not a good a i d like but it is a great deal and meet the need
great price on toothbrush been using a uple week and see result aready
i m a gadget guy and i have been watching this product for a while i have read and read about the capability and finally decided to pull the trigger when i saw it on the shelf it is been about week now and i have learned a lot of the feature alexa cannotell you the forecast your mmute and even some dad joke the sound quality is much better than most of my other bluetooth speaker but she ha to be plugged in all the time no internal battery with this model right now it seems like more of a novelty in my kitchen but i plan on adding some home automation to get my money is worth i do not think you ll be disappointed with the hardware or ai but it is difficult to add extra capability or skill through the necessary app because you have to scroll through all of them sequentially the developer should add category or a search function by capability last i checked there were other model will the same ai capability and at lower price point read some more review and article and find the one you can justify dropping on you ll like it

this is a simple tablet and easy to use i would buy it again
like the hardware both box and the remote ntrol is very aethetic and nice to use processor is fastest by the time i bouth it and still fast enough for my system liked that i uld install android apps i wish they implemented ntfs for the microsd card file system it is limited to fat that limit a file size le thn gb no power off switch is another bummer but overall i chose this over roku or even
work great no issue awsome productgoing to buy another one
easy to read under different lightning nditions soft glow of the light at night make reading before sleep easier on your eye but what i like most of all is this is only used for reading and i do not get distracted checking email fb internet etc
very nice gift for worker not too pricey and easy to use for an older person who is not too tech savvy
this is definitely not an ipad or a high end tablet nevertheless for the disunted price that i paid on it so le than it is well worth getting i wanted something bigger while waiting for the next ipad air to me out and this fit the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet it is geared towards amazon medium nsumption ad it doe that decently even with a screen resolution le than hd if the sale me back again where it is off i would not hesitate to remmend it again
i love it and it is very easy to use i take it every where i go
work perfect for my niece she love it great deal
good product for the money mpared to earlier version not a durable the outside casing is plastic not good for the money good buy
nice product i like the lor of the screen very clear
it wa easy set up really love the echo and the quality of sound
we got this just before christmas and have really enjoyed having it my year old love playing question asking random question and checking the weather we do have many of our light throughout the house where alexa will ntrol them a well a the nest thermostat the music selection is pretty expansive with just what me with prime but we may upgrade the music liked it so much we bought two dot for the bedroom and have them hooked up to speaker alexa is not perfect but neither is siri overall it is been a great purchase for our family
i bought of these tablet for my yr old sunday school class to use during our lesson they love them the tablet are easy to use and a good size for that age group very much worth the price
basically the tab is feature are good there are huge amazon llections kid can be allowed to use it without parent monitoring a parent ntrol feature is good several useful amazon product are offered free of charge i hope that it is worth for the money value
had to return two tablet b c they had dead pixel third wa fine
if you want a simple tablet to watch show and play game this is it the nstant ad from amazon are annoying however
this is a must buy for anyone it is sturdy and it a amazon for only fifty dollar but the camera is not good for photography but it worth fifty dollar overall
i initially bought an echo because of the hue light system and nest thermostat ntrol that it can give with just your voice while these thing work wonderfully boy wa i surprised when i disvered many of the other thing it can do my wife and i are avid reader but with two small child we do not have the time a often anymore we were surprised to see that alexa uld not only play audio book but uld read any book from our kindle library additionally the sound quality is quite good for the size of the device my only minor mplaint is that the bass sound is lacking some at higher volume otherwise you should most certainly buy one
i bought this tablet for my son and he enjoys using it the only thing i do not love is that u need internet to use most apps on it and you cant download youtube kid it ha a lot of apps though and a lot of learning material for all age
my son love how easy it is to navigate through the apps
it is what it is awesome and basic if you use amazon and you need a small tablet then walaaa
bought this tablet for year old it holding up good she love it she enjoys playimg her game being able to get on the internet
this device is very interesting and i am just learning the possibility that it can be used to do i get the weather the morning news highlight and it will find the kind of music that i like i also understand it can be integrated into my home security system i am looking forward to exploring the possibility
christmas present for the kid it strong and durable and nstantly used inexpensive a is unless you want to get the kid proof case apps game web browsing and video photo function are good do think how this item will be used a most likely it internal storage at gb will fill up quickly
i think it is good mpliment to regular cable if you have subcriptions to the various apps netflix amazon hulu etc you may be able to eliminate cable all together it work seamless with remote the voice feature is ok but i have not really gotten the jist of it overall good product
everyone we know who bought echo ha loved it we are looking forward to learning all it can do so far so good with ease of use
good product for the price and is large enough for viewing but small enough for travel
she love her kindle and read it every night i am looking forward to seeing her face when she open this in a uple week better screen and wifi that work the old one lost wifi connection in an update or something but work with usb it about year old even with those issue she love the old one so this one is going to be spectacularly awesome and the new screen and feature are gonna be so appreciated
i just broke my rd generation kindle after many year had to get a new one the new kindle ha more feature in an intrusive format it is hard to get book loaded deleted llected and even to turn the page an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page or a twitchy finger and you re down the rabbit hole i really just want a reader not another tablet
love it bought one for my daughter and ended up buying one for myself
great stereo and back porch lighting we use alexa on our back porch when in our hot tub a a stereo and to turn our hue go lighting on we also use her for hue lighting in the bedroom and the hue lighting strip in the kitchen you can also learn new alexa skill on your iphone every day i m and it is super easy to learn how to use alexa you cannotoo
great tablet well worth the price which wa a deal on black friday
i love the amazon fire tv i chose it over the the fire stick because i have k tv the picture is crystal clear you need a strong internet signal in order to strem effectively without all the buffering this is a great option if you are tired of cable or just do not enjoy paying the high price you can access your favorite streaming apps hulu netflix etc
kindle paperwhite is great for reading any time day or night without needing a light and any where beach bed airplane so much more nvenient i e better than carrying a book or several book

i bought last year and more this year for gift they are simple to use and the youngest can even do it himself yo get the kindle free time for the kid you can set the amount of time they can play game and then they can only read book great for the whole family
i had a wink hub which i stopped using long time back a it wa clunky so when i saw the new echo i thought i will give it a try now not a day go by when i dont use the echo i have connected my kasa light to alexa my phone bluetooth speaker anything and everything you can just ask echo to turn off light turn it on connect to your phone etc and alexa will just do it no more pulling out ur phone to play music
this is now my third kindle reader i have been exceedingly impressed with them the paper white is the best so far so happy that i no longer need the bulky clip on light to read at night

mainly purchased for my kid to watch movie on long road trip put in a gb microsd card and you have endless entertainment
i bought this for my friend and he loved it he wa looking forward to this a uple of year ago
i bought this a a gift and they wwere very pleased
i bought this for year old to replace an older ipad it wa functional but no where near level of ipad this is understandable based on price difference i returned to store
love this tablet super bright lors great for gamers cannot bet this tablet for any price
this little box is awesome if you have amazon primeits a must have and even if you do not it is still worth it is weight in gold sure just about every device can play netflix or any of your other streaming service but this thing is quick with prime you can also add starz or showtime for an additional fee and that ll give you access to all there ntent from this thing native interface no other apps needed
i initially went to buy a speaker just to listen to music around the house but i wa talked into getting this instead best choice ever not only do i listen to my music i also play game listen to all the unusual fact she spews out i ask her question when i m trying to cheat on my jeopardy game on my phone i use it a a reminder for all my shopping item that randomly me to my mind everyday i literally take her everywhere i can connect to wifi i do not have anything negative to say other than i kinda wish it wa portable and didnhave to be plugged in everywhere but i guess that is what the tap is for right i would remmend also fun fact i love when a mmercial me on about the product and she hears her name she responds it wa quite funny when it initially happened
this amazon kindle is awesome ha all it is feature including a built in camera purchase this for my son for his th birthday he absolutely love it
my wife is mom wanted a tablet this wa a great way to get her into technology and she love it not ipad or galaxy but good start
the echo ha great sound and awesome microphone but doe not play music from youtube or find music easily even with amazon music unlimited bluetooth is a plus
bought for my yr old autistic grandson so far so good with parental guidance
i bought this primarily for reading at night without a nightlight a to not disturb my wife it ha been perfect for that and normal reading nditions i wa nervous to move away from actual book but it ha not been a bad a i initially thought
this wa just the right size for travel and there is no glare i especially like the dictionary feature
overall good product doe what is advertised mfortable to use
if you have amazon prime membership i would suggest this device also not the remote ha access to alexa so there is more possibility for using it with smart home device
this kindle paper white is an excellent choice for reading on the beach or in sunlight
got it for my husband to read at night in bed he love that it ha a lit screen unlike the original model however he cannot read his textbook from school so that is a big negative
bought the amazon fire tablet a christmas gift for my grandson age and they both liked it it ha a nice size screen for them to play their game on and you cannot beat the price better than having them play on our expensive cell phone
love it for my boy we received the kid edition for christmas last year the screen cracked a month ago and amazon promptly replaced the device without incident great yr replacement plan shortly after that my older son who previously used a nook finally broke i decided since younger brother had a kid kindle that we would purchase a send one to replace the barnes and noble nook i love the fact that i can ntrol what is on his profile i love that it u a micro usb charger and the warranty wa the biggest selling feature my boy are and and they are not very careful sometimes my son did however get a kindle with a pink case because it wa all that best buy had in stock i wish that case were cheaper and i would gladly replace it best tablet for this age and in this price range n no google play store slow sometimes have to re download apps frequently when running out of space lack of popular apps
today is technology allows hand free multitasking i would highly remmend
great product for my kid to read wa an xmas gift
i bought this for my daughter and she love it many apps for kid
i used this primarily a a bluetooth speaker it is good
gave my younger twin the echo an they love telling alexa what to do their older sister is named alexa
it is cheap so i didnt expect it to be amazing nor am i disappointed it is great for streaming video even better with chromecast
alexa is fun you can play music and ask it question it doe not play all the music you want and will not answer all your question i have yet to connect it to any home device but that is the next step i see a lot of potential for this product
great sound quality love all the function that it ha
bought it for my daughter and she love it great product at a great price
i like the light weight and enjoy reading out side again
since i am more of an apple buckie i wish this had more integration to my itunes library i use it with my lifex light get the news and weather not sure i would buy it again but if you are a google buckie then it would be a great toy
the best tablet for the money i use it all the time
got of them great st for what you get my kid are down to only one left killed of them sadly setting up can be a pain kid keep asking to add more apps you have to delete the old to add more i m starting to dislike them more then the kid like them
after looking at several similar product and looking at multiple review the amazon fire hd seemed like the best choice the fact that it wa on sale one third off on black friday made the final choice easy we are very pleased with how this product work and how it met our need for a bit larger screen easy for u mid seventy year old to use
tablet is great for surfing the internet and downloading movie to watch on the airplane
for the price it is the best tablet you re going to find it is pretty quick though not a quick a the more expensive model and hold a ton of book and a decent amount of movie display is nice again not a nice a the more expensive kindle fire but it is totally worth what i paid for it
bought it a a christmas for a family member she u it everyday the music sound great
it is the amazon echo doe what it say and get you in touch with alexa hand free work good and awesome for the smart home person
super easy to use love how it is voice activated so it is nvenient
good tablet gave a gift and person enjoys it remmend
bought it for my year old mom she ha enjoyed reading on it easy to use
it performed the way it said it would and more awesome buy
the amazon echo is a great item help you with everyday thing music note shopping list timer etc
bought it for my grandson he love it he is and he know his way around the kindle better than i do
easy and age appropriate can set timer for tv and movie watching my granddaughter find the educational game more interesting and fun
this is a little delay in responding and you can definitely stump it i would remmend the cheaper version that can do the same
i like the tablet a lot it fast and easy to use and the price wa right
i needed a kindle for my schooling so i decided to look into this and read some review after reading the review i decided on this kindle and it is perfect mpared to my other tablet
purchased a a gift and my family really enjoyed it
i had been looking into getting an amazon device and i wa torn between the echo and the dot i ended up getting the echo and it ha not disappointed the sound from it is a very nice quality and i love asking alexa to turn on the light you have to purchase other thing to do this play music what the weather is like etc overall a great purchase
i m currently in love with this item setting reminder also playing music with spotify and bluetooth
do not buy this if u do not read book also very rarely read the book
great inexpensive tablet for everyday use it is not powerful enough for super graphical game but it is great for basic apps like surfing the web email news etc amazon ha underground apps which is totally free including in app purchase only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ad in them usually product that is on your amazon wishlist all in all it is a great tablet that you do not have to worry about if you break it
for starter i had the amazon stick for a while got tired of that due to all the buffering issue but what can you expect out of that little stick so when this went on sale i decided to upgrade i am so happy i did it work great ha reduced the buffering to a minimum but like anything online depends on the site your on love the fact you can speak into the remote and pull up the site you want
simple to set up and use this is the send fire inch i have purchased first one wa for mother in law for christmas she love to read and this tablet work great for her i use this one mainly to play music through blue tooth speaker on deck battery life is very good also grand kid love to play game on it
got this for my year old along with a kid proof case and he love it and for the price it is perfect ton of free apps for him too
the amazon echo provides great sound quality with no fuss just say alexa play me some music and voila set up is easy
great product for surfing the internet or reading book
i love this kindle easy to use great on the eye
now own echo dot echo tap and the echo remmend all highly
this is a great tablet for the price work a lot like an ipad i would remmend it
needed a replacement tablet and looked at a variety of option the fire wa at a good price and is working well
sound quality is pretty good if you want it to play background music but i still prefer sonos for this purpose alexa is useful for ntrolling the widest range of smart home product but it is not backed by google home is superior search intelligence so it is not that great for asking in depth question of it there are mparisons of these product out there so take a look before making a decision since i mostly wanted it for home ntrol it suit my need
i just plugged it in and connected it to my amazon acunt super easy to use since it is voice activated i check the weather and traffic every morning plus ask alex almost anything
what a super product so very nvenient being able to ask question or give mmands rather than firing up the mputer and typing
nice tablet for the price got it for my son birthday ha not opened it yet but my brother in law ha and it work great great tablet for kid just in case they break it
i love how fast it go from one program to another program i like the apps that it ha on it and also i like that is able to work with all my television that will problem
great product from amazon that doe not fail package well
great product i will remmend this to all of my family and friend
we got this on a one day special and took a chance i would say that alexa generally work better than siri on most thing and more nsistently the speaker alone is good but the ability to play radio via tunein pandora amazon music etc is value enough beyond the little thing like saying alexa set a timer for minute or alexa what is the weather going to be like overall very impressed with the echo remmended highly
great to read at night in bed great detail and easy on the eye
this fire is much better than the old one so far it responds much faster and ha a much better screen i also put a gig memory stick into it which the old fire uld not acmmodate so far so good
great price sound great it can do alot of stuff
just a advertised answer to question only take a uple of sends great thorough information is returned by alexa looking to buy some echo dot in the very near future
love this tablet have bought several for gift because i love mine so much
echo came in on time and packaged well size is good playing music is good doe not always understand what is asked and some thing doe not know or have to find just right way to ask however i m still learning about it and it is still learning responds very quickly when it understands what is asked it is fun so far and i hope will get even better
we have google home and the echo we like google home better
enjoying alexa a lot easy to use and great provider of information and music
this is amazing tablet with almost all must have feature
this is a great tablet i absolutely would remmend it to a friend i would buy it again
after reading many review on the other mpetitor product and even purchased another one that wa much more expensive and mplicated to install and operate we decided on this one and uld not be happier easy to install operate and ha many feature that we use daily a big plus if you are an amazon prime member although the family u this mostly for tv and movie i use it mostly for listening to music it is fast and we now have the unit on two tv is we also gave one for xmas
i love this item it is worth the prize my son love the tsnley
to be clear this is not a tablet it is a reader just a reader but it is a great reader very tactile
i have been using my phone to play game and facebook this tablet is awesome wish i had bought several more for my grand child
i like the tech but it go off off line way to often and it is not that easy to get restarted some time
didnthink i would get much out of this but i already had hue light harmony remote and august smart lock alexa ntrols all of them she is also a ol mpanion giving my news and sport update in the morning while i make my ffee mindfulness minute are great when paired with apple watch app of the same name
we love it everyone in the house is able to use alexa very user friendly the instruction were simple just set up and start asking question or making request
i have used the kindle app on an ipad and android tablet and phone and i love it this is my first kindle device so i cannot mpare it to previous kindle version the only drawback to using the kindle app on the previoulsy mentioned device is that they cannot be seen in direct sunlight and that is the biggest advantage i see to owning a kindle you can read outside in daylight also the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use it doe what it say it will do and you cannot beat the battery life the x ray feature is also a bonus that you do not get with the app
doe the job and doe it well
i bought this a an upgrade to my old kindle the backlighting is great now my wife doe not have to leave the light on at night to read
bought for my year old very rugged and easy to use love it u the android apps and kiddo love it
really like my kindle paperwhite very nice feel responsive intuitive menu and easy to read
great little product for the price not the best camera but it doe not claim to be
bought for my office and i m very well pleased very simple setup easily connects with my cell phone voice mmands have worked wonderfully
easy to setup my wife enjoys listening to christian music while working it ha been a great buy
easily stored very lightweight keep me entertained
since my kindle paperwhite died this new voyage ha been a good replacement
this ha been really good easy to read and easy to transport
this product may be extremely overpriced but it also life up to everything it is promised it is a lightweight long lasting ereader that is much easier on the eye than an ipad it is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback and i find myself renting kindle pie of book i already own just to take advantage of the device is nvenience
bought this tablet for my year old and also one for my father both are able to use this for their own purpose and are very happy price is good especially since kid tend to be a bit rough with electronics plus for profile creation and restricting access to feature from kid
this is a great tablet for the money it work for what i need it for checking email downloading book and magazine great price and very lightweight i wa able to facebook messenger my sister who life in alaska which is something i had not been able to do with my phone or my laptop so i am happy
this one wa for my baby and she is happy a a kid with a new toy i have my own tab so not familiar with fire yet but wa a good deal
i bought of everything like this one the best very good sound grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music
i havent had a problem since i been using it it work great
hand down this is the best ereader that you can buy
very easy setup excited about receiving rave review from other owner
i purchased the kindle fire because i needed a entertainment only device for long flight this device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your amazon acunt it is worth purchasing a fire tablet if you are an amazon prime member if not i would not remmend it because the available apps are limited my only mplaint about this device is that if it freeze it is difficult to reset
it is the best and closest you will get to a book but i still miss that feel of holding a book

we bought these for our and yr old kid for christmas they use ipads at school and are used to working on a tablet the fire ha been an excellent choice for them it is easy to navigate and user friendly
i m amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and i remmend it
this wa actually an impulse purchase i wa out for the weekend and forgot my kindle so i picked up one of these it work so much better than you d expect from a budget tablet the screen is very responsive to touch and ha good lor reproduction unless your looking at the screen from just a uple inch away the pixel are not overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp this is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it get lost or damaged and it is a good e reader and cheaper than the e paper model oddly enough
wanted something small and this wa perfect size
my daughter like her new kindle it is her send one she wa surprised we bought her another one the first one lasted year
i needed an android device to run an app no longer on the io app store i later learned it wa not in amazon is store so i had to install a work around got the play store downloaded the app and deleted the play store it would not be my first choice in tablet but it doesnwhat i purchased it for and doe it better than i expected i do not appreciate the lack of security and encryption but i intentionally leave private info off the device so it doe not impact me
being an avid reader with a preference towards hardback i wa very skeptical of e reader because i also travel extensively carrying hardback and having enough lighting to read ha been a challange my husband purchased a kindle paperwhite for me for christmas upon opening i wa not sure i wa ready to go digital however i love it i have already mpleted book the paperwhite is backlit and easy to hold it fit in the palm of my hand so one handed reading is easy i am now a believer
simple and deluxe function well and hold up even with kid and their paw it layout and usability a bit nfusing at first watch out for amazon add ons to charge your acunt though
amazon fire inch tablet is a great product and work great and no issue
daughter loved this a a gift she get migraine if she were to read ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eye and finger crossed no headache
it is good just need to adjust take bit tine
it is great for doing anything on amazon however you cannot use google card to purchase anything with they re great for reading book surfing the net game are abundance and the processor is fast so you really do not have a lag
easy to operate a child can use it mean apps the camera and chat an time are a very good feature amazon make it easy to use
the paper white doe what it claim it will do you can go for week on end w only a single charge and it still have juice reading and import document such a per file are simple via drag n drop in the root folder which you ll create document i only which that the ability to read doc docx file were available rather than having to nvert file to pdf format the screen is gentle to the eye to read whether outside in the sun or a low light setting backlight or not
i am so very i got this for my year old grandson he can navigate it to get to his favorite show peppa pig mickey clubhouse and thomas the train he is so happy with his tablet
great tablet for beginner nice and simple great price
the tablet work well and the silin pumper ver is great for gripping
this tablet wa and still is i would remmend it to anyone who is looking for a tablet
far surpasses my expectation would definitely remmend it a a beginner tablet
charge good sturdy charger feel like good quality not like the plastic feeling you get from buying from those cheap type of charger
work fine alittle pricy kindle without is not good
i bought this tablet for a christmas for a family member gift even thought i wa not too sure of the quality of this tablet because it wa very inexpensive the person who received the tablet wa very satisfied with the speed screen resolution and apps
kindle fire meet the need of kid and or adult
i had an older version of a kindle e reader that allowed me to download book on the go but i felt like something wa missing several upgrade later i got this for a gift and i think it basically includes everything that wa missing it is so lightweight and mpact that i can easily slip it into my purse or use it with one hand it ha backlighting that doe not disturb my sleeping husband or create a light so bright that it is distracting it is just the right amount of light needed to read in different ligths it can self adjust from reading in a dark room to reading outside on a bright day
if you are a prime member and use kindle for reading this a great tablet i wish there were more apps made to work in the fire tablet like nfl mobile and nfl fantasy
the kindle paperwhite wa well worth the upgrade from my previous kindle e reader the touch screen capability make it so much handier than turning page and navigating with button and the lighted display let me sit and read wherever i like these feature use up battery a bit faster than the basic model but recharging more frequently is not so bad nsidering the nveniences gained i noticed one bothersome quirk which is the reason i gave it star instead of sometimes it jump ahead more than one page when i touch to turn checking online i see that i m not the only one experiencing this problem if it ntinues or bemes more bothersome i will contact amazon customer service for a solution
we got a great deal on fire hd my kid love playing on it
noticeable improvement over the fire inch if you re a first time tablet owner then the fire inch is a great device but if you have owned a tablet with higher spec there is a noticeable improvement with the fire inch the fire ha a better display and faster processing
highly remmend we have both the google device and this one both sre great alexa is mire versatile kid love it too
fun and interesting but will be better a the apps and software available for this item are more advanced available
this product is very useful for watching tv and streaming netflix and others easy to use and easy to hook up work great good alternative to a smart tv
this is such an awesome product i highly remmend it very easy to use and capable of so much
kindle wa no longer charging properly and this solved the problem
i found this to be a great tablet for all age easy to use great ntent
my little girl love it and she can do so many thing with it and the sound wa a little to good because now i have to buy her some bluetooth headphone
this a great table for my granddaughter she love it
i am able to stream movie without any buffering issue and the voice mmand make searching for show very easy

really enjoy it would remmend it to others thanks
the amazon fire work terrific it great for emailing social networking and web browsing i can even play a few game on it too battery life is really great too i remmend this to everyone
i wa ntemplating to buy either the insignia or the fire hd i m so glad i chose the latter it is so fast and sufficient for my need i also downloaded google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase for you cannot go wrong with this purchase
if you are in the amazon esystem the fire hd is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet very responsive good screen and so far the battery life ha been great the only drawback of the fire is the apps are only available from the amazon app store not the google play store for example there is no gmail application to install but that is not what i use this for kindle reading netflix viewing occasional facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device cannot beat it for
very pleased with the performance thought i would miss turning page but i do not some may prefer a larger screen i would buy again
it is very easy to read no glare at all easy to get up and going
had the kindle th gen with no backlight and upgraded to the paperwhite wa one of the best decision i have made you do not even notice that there is a backlight because it blend in so well and mpared to the th gen is a night and day difference buy this you will not regret it
very good and easy to handle the price wa very good
i have an original kindle fire and am really enjoying my new updated version larger screen and very easy to navigate
this is the send kindle paperwhite that i have bought the first is now in use by another family member i truly enjoy reading with this e reader is it easy to adjust text size and brightness depending on your need and room lighting
i bought this a a gift for a family member and she loved it great simple tablet
not a mprehensive a i thought basic question avaid her perview i hope there will be some software upgrade soon

i bought this tablet for on black friday to download a few little game and play doe a great job for that
good for what it is supposed to be not a high end ipad for sure but for the price cannot beat it gift for my son a low risk way to acclimate him to tablet but not a big loss if he destroys it relatively speedy good resolution o take a lot of getting used to after io parental ntrols were a nice addition
i love my kindle i have dozen and dozen of book in the palm of my hand the paperwite screen is just like looking at a page on paper no eye strain now they just need to get the paperwhite with lor by the way when i received my device from the store it wa set up for the russian language but i wa able to fumble through the menu and change it to english
i purchased this two week ago and we have watched it every night it is extremely fast ha k ntent and ha a nice voice remote
surprised how powerful this little thing is easy to use and setup wa a breeze
at first wa not sure if i would use this product all that much but now love it listening to howard at any time and getting the minute it will take to get to work so i can plan when i really need to leave the house and the weather response ha been very accurate
i use this daily for playstation vue nstant fps and it look great
any time any thing just ask and she is getting smarter everyday
easy to use when traveling ha all i need and is fast and vers my need
the amazon kindle paperwhite wa a gift to my husband he is very happy with it for several reason reading from the non reflective screen is effortless and he can adjust the size of the character he cannotake note and highlight part of the text two really neat feature are if you take note on a book that you borrowed from the library those note will still be there even after you return the book so if you happen to borrow the same book a few week later when you open the book on your e reader your note will be there in a mplicated story with lot of character the e reader keep track of who is who in a paper book you would have to flip the page back and forth to figure that out no need to do this with the e reader
it is a great unit to watch movie and tv and it is very portable
got this on black friday sale for the price you uld not beat it i ended up purchasing of these the graphic camera are definitely limited but if all you need is a basic tablet to run amazon apps this is great for the price the fact that it is expandable with an sd card put it above the more expensive basic kindle that my kid use that nstantly is full
we bought this one and a black one for our kid it is very durable and good price for the quality for myself personally i still prefer my ipad but if on a budget you wonregret the investment it is so simple i sometimes struggle using it the free time experience is awesome for little one and i can set parameter which is a huge bonus for a first time tablet user this is a solid product
i feel that it is a good product for reading a book especially since you can carry many book with you instead of carrying the actual book i thought it would be a brighter screen than others but am a little disappointed in that regard
this kindle is awesome put off getting one for way too long light weight and cute fit in a purse or bag and you hardly know it is there reading is simple and easy downloading book is a breeze do not hesitate to get this kindle you will love it
perfect for reading in all nditions with great battery life
the amazon fire tv is very easy to setup work faster than fire stick because of a ethernet connection
i find this satisfies my desire for a book reader and small tablet at an excellent price on special sale it is a version of android and will take many but not all android apps actually i have not used many nventional android apps with it and none of them ha failed to work i have been able to use bluetooth accessory such a keyboard and powered external speaker i would buy this again and actually have but the send time is a a gift
i went to get the smaller echo but spoke to a salesperson and this one ha a much better speaker and it wa on sale
great tablet for the price very satisfied with the quality of tablet
i bought this for my grandson and he like it a lot he is only year old and it is perfect size for him he wanted a red one but like the blue we put abc mouse on it and he is able to find it for himself great price
the picture quality is great it is easy to use and great for my home
it work and stream very good like the memory and it is still portable
purchased this a a gift waiting for the owner to advise
i really like the smaller size reader and being left handed the ease of use of the haptic page turn button are very easy to use i do not even use the touch screen page advance any more with the haptic advance this can be done from the right or left side of the reader an advantagefor u lefty this is my fourth kindle i keep upgrading due to all the change and advance i use my kindle every night and enjoy it very much and would highly remmend if you want to upgrade to the voyage visit your local best buy and hold it in your hand and feel and see the difference
the amazon echo wa easy to setup straight out of the box and my family began using it immediately we are learning new thing it can do every week the sound quality is amazing and this ha beme the primary music source for my house when purchasing i would have preferred a black echo but white is all this best buy had at the time before xmas but white look very clean on our kitchen unter where it sits there are some word alexa is still struggling with understanding but we do have a bit of a texas drawl so i think we re getting used to each other
awesome steaming device mpared to the roku i would give the amazon fire tv the edge great buy i would remmend this product to anyone who is thinking about cutting the rd on their cable subscription
work good but you can purchase a charger with same or better spec on amazon much cheaper i purchased a port watt charger for about of the st of this
the kindle fire is a good tablet it is easy to navigate
we now own the echo and the dot and both are great and cannot be remmended more
exactly what i thought the amazon fire stick would be
she is smart funny entertaining and very helpful you should have her in your home she is so worth it
it would be beneficial to have amazon prime to give even more option very easy to use and set up wa simple the ability to add other wifi device is a great option we use it to turn light on adjust our thermostat play music answer question and so much more
good tablet but not a smooth a high end tablet it is limited to amazon so do not expect to do a much a an android or ipad i like mine and will ntinue to use it i remmend using one if you can before buying
great way to get info quickly and it is so easy to use
love my fire box already had the stick and loved it so this wa a no brainer
this ha been one of the best tech gadget i have ever purchased it take some patience in learning what to say easy though

great tablet for the money easy to use easy to set up great for reading or browsing the internet
the amazon fire tablet is definitely not the best tablet out there but it is definitely the best at this price point it ha all of the feature i wa looking for without the fluff it may be limiting if you do not have an amazon acunt but it is not a deal breaker i think this is a great tablet for those who are not looking for all of the bell and whistle

love the new fire hd price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr it even better great for the kid a you can lock their profile to a kid mode and they cannot buy anything if i had one downfall it the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play
i cannot imagine a day without my fire reader i absolutely love it and it is so light and easy to carry with me it is a big part of my day and night it is so easy to use and download book and magazine and even movie i would highly remmend it to anyone
i purchased this tablet for my yr old daughter and it is been outstanding with separate parent ntrols make it a breeze to keep kid away from unwanted site

alexa can be annoying sometimes when doe not respond to your mmands or doe not know the answer or answer from the tv but i still love it i have two of them

this is a good tablet at a great price love it
i am really glad i decided to purchase the firebox faster than the stick
ha great sound and base responds rrectly to all my wuestions
the sound and screen quality are great and i like the blue light cutoff feature i found that toggling back forth online to be clumsy mpared to a tablet it is lightweight and easier to handle for long period of time

i purchased this tablet and have been pleasantly surprised how simple it is to use very user friendly and have not one mplaint

i love this kindle it is a replacement for my old kindle keyboard i used it nstantly for hour every day carried it in my purse all the time and traveled with it i will not be without a kindle nice product
if you have decided to buy a digital assistant this is the one to choose google home is good but not nearly a refined a alexa i have used both extensively and the echo is the hand down winner

the price wa great and my kid love it just bought another a a gift
i thought i wa getting a fast charger for the price i paid for this it wa for this slow charger the same price amazon charge for the fast charger this charger should have been included with my paperwhite buyer beware this is way overpriced and should be free with the purchase od a kindle
i have an apple tv and the amazon fire dreaming fire station much more
k quality is great the alexa ffeature work awesome
the echo is working with no problem and we are still learning new way and idea to ask question about everything and anything pleased with the purchase and quality
i got this because it wa a cheap tablet it doe great for watching video from the tablet and sound is good also i do not like the amazon esystem or app store i wish they would sell android tablet with their apps on them like they are doing with their phone
got this tablet for my niece and nephew it is wonderful for child
bought for family member wa on their christmas list
i bought this tablet for my grandson a a birthday present you can set time a child use it and what your child can view on the internet
turning sometimes the page turn when your not aware of it the battery length is much better
i bought the amazon echo for myself right before christmas i ended up returning it because my wife got me one a a christmas present it is ol technology and is fun to play around with but i think the real value of it is realized if you have mpatible home automation product however i m not in that boat yet
while mparing to other mpetitive product the echo appeared to be the best purchased a a gift for a family memeber
i have bought this tablet for my other grandaughters and it work fine for them this one is for the year old the other are and year old great parental ntrol feature
bought this tablet for my year old it doe not have the best amount of memory but it doe have a spot for a mini sd card it is pretty durable and easy to use
wife like it and i can sleep at night without the room getting lit up
i love my fire tablet use it everyday from mail to game
the amazon fire tablet it self i give a i thought it had the google play store on it and the kid uld not find the game stuff they wanted but my youngest love it walking him through the whole process after the other kid tried it out i did a system restore back to factory setting i liked it and so did my son so all in all i think fit well
i am sure alexa doe many thing but so far she ha not reached her full potential user need to learn to implement her skill
bought a gift for yr old it is not too mplicated and perfect size for use of kid excellent choice
i specifically got this kindle for reading outside without glare
great for reading not great for playing game need more storage
i bought this since it ha a special disunt for elite plus member
great tablet lag free when running apps good battery life only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror wa available on older version but no longer
the product work well or so there are day the unit seems to get nfused or is very slow in responding
the fire tv is a great reliable product i have several including the fire stick i cannot say enough good thing about them
i bought two of these for my kid they have destroyed ipads and this wa a low st replacement great price still not an ipad substitute
i own two nook tablet another kindle and a samsung and this is the best one yet excellent battery life let me check email the web and with kindle book can be switched from read to listens also work better than the nook with audiobooks
i like the echo for the intelligence that alexa brings i wish it had sound quality that matched that of my sonos or rather the sonos had the smart of the echo either way i do not regret buying the device
amazon is know for there tablet mine work great good wifi and memory i love the quad re processor great screen crisp and clear mfortable and easy to use
echo is more polished and ahead of the curve it integrates well with my smart light and play music through spotify need integration with my fire stick but harmony hub is a great solution for this for now
the product fully exceeded my expectation highly remmend
for the same price a the roku you can get the amazon fire tv box why would you want this it run android you can install android apps via sideload it is extensible because of item and you can really make this any kind of device you want most android apps should work on this and of urse you have access to netflix hulu amazon etc
for the price it is hard to beat do not go into this thinking it is like any other android tab in many way it is and the ability to sideload apps help but this is primarily a vehicle to get you into the amazon esystem not necessarily bad but those expecting full access to google will be disappointed what it is good for web surfingnewsreaderaudio playernetflix hulu etcwhat is not so great no gps location enabled but not true gpsscreen resolution angle and clarity are good but given the price it can be forgiven
new exactly what i wanted dot dot dot and i always buy from best buy when i get the opportunity

i am so happy i bought this i have firestick also and love to stream netflix work amazing and much faster than firestick
i love this so many apps and the quality is mpatible with a k tv the only thing is sometimes the apps freeze and restart sometimes this doe not happen often though
this kindle is great for the price however there are some downside to paying for a tablet the battery life go very quickly so daily charge are necessary if you re a heavy reader you also cannot save anything of merit like book or magazine to a mini sd card thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money

love it easy to use so simple to order book and they are immediately downloaded
love my echo and going to purchase a send one for an rv
easy to setup and use had it pulled off the patio table onto ncrete min after i had it setup didndent it or damage it beyond some scratch battery would be great feature to add

i decided to cut cable and thought this amazon tv would be a good alternative it is a great product i really do like it it take a little while to get used to using it there is a lot of clicking to get to a show however i am not a prime member so there are a lot of show that we cannot watch

a an avid book reader i have always loved having an actual book i wa very reluctant to get a kindle at first however it ha been such a surprise it is very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book you can easily download new book at the click of a button there are daily and monthly deal you cannotake advantage of for a fraction of the st of a regular book the viewing experience is superb because you can change font and size and increase or decrease background lighting making it very easy to read in any light if i do not know a word i can automatically look up the definition or add highlight or note plus i can carry an entire library with me where ever i go i actually read way more now than i ever did before i am extremely impressed with this device and it is more than exceeded my expectation i highly remmend it to anyone
i do not like reading too many physical book because it is a bit bothersome to lug around the heavy volume having everything in this device is great since it is e ink and lit

would have gotten star but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading all the add make it feel cluttered but that might just be me over all for price it is a nice ereader
it is a great addition to my home office my alexa is upstairs
it is very entertaining and provides instant information
set up wa easy alexa so far ha been on target and extremely helpful
i am able to adjust the font size for easier reading the size of the unit is small enough to fit in a pocket and make it more portable than other reader it hold a charge for a much longer time than another reader from another mpany doe which i appreciate i hate starting to read and find out the battery ha run low and i have to stop to charge

i love this thing how did we live with out it before hand such and amazing product
i purchased the fire for my self to play game and surf the web then my husband took my fire so i purchased one for him
you give an amazing tablet with front and rear facing camera a nice interface fairly snappy performance and durability all for under buck i cant imagine not buying these for your kid but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any mean i f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that doe most of the thing people want this little tablet definitely delivers the value
love the amount of time we can set that she can be on this the bumper guard ha been handy apps that were on it are awesome best of all she love it
screen is very clear and it is easy to use great product for the price
bought it for my mother in a nursing home and didnwant to take a chance of an expensive tablet getting stolen the childproof setting are perfect for the situation to prevent random purchase the button for sending email are too small for someone whose eyesight and manual dexterity are not perfect it is a bit slow on response time but for the cheap price a minor innvenience in this situation
this product is wonderful we use it for shopping list music and general info we sit around the dinner table wondering about something and we just ask her it also great for timer and measuring love it
echo connects to the alexa voice service to ntrol smart home device play music provide information news sport sres weather and more instantly all you have to do is ask
no mplaints i just wish it played avi but that is not really a huge problem
great battery life and easy to navigate great value
nice lightweight reader very thin and so easy to use and navigate love it
fantastic product for a fantastic price and a fantastic service
worked good for a month the kid loved it but then just went black and would not me back on sending it back to get a new one with the warranty
this fire tv is a great product and it met my expectation
this fire tablet ha long battery life reasonable fast
good for the price expandable memory laggy at time
it is buck there is no better tablet for that price range toss in prime and it is even better
very high quality item good sound however preferred the google knowledge of the google home so ended up returning this item
i love everything about my fire tv i wish i wouldve gotten one sooner
amazon fire tv is easy to use and is very easy to setup
this thing is amazing the possibility are endless
this tablet is good for basic web browsing and lite app use great for kid or someone who is not going to be a heavy tablet user great introductory tablet
the fire tv ha been a ol utility to add to the entertainment department in our household much more responsive than the stick hardly any lag ntinuous update from amazon keep the ui fresh ever evolving ntent is a plus
purchased this a uple of week ago no mplaints so far web page load pretty quickly on the silk browser and the battery life is excellent after installing google play store it is really easy even more apps are available cannot beat this for under a hundred dollar
the product is great for playing music and placing amazon order however request for information receive answer that are very short on fact
wife and kid love this product i think it ha beme our personal weathergirl
very hard to set up child profile without paying for a subscription to freetime once i got it finally set up though run smoothly but battery doe not seem to last very long
work a expected without any glitch very happy with the purchase
easy to setup and use would remmend to anyone looking for a nvenient way to add a smart tv to their home
this is a great virtual assistant learning new skill everyday work perfectly with my nest thermostat
i did some research on different streaming device before i bought the firetv i would highly remmend it i actually just cancelled my cable subscription because it work that well i m now saving over month you cannot beat that there are ton of apps and everyone can watch what they want
the main reason i purchased this wa because i like to annotate scripture and insert personal note or related note to passage especially meaningful to me it is much easier to insert mments now with the keyboard display than it wa to insert mments on the old kindle i have so that wa a huge bonus the one draw back gripe i have is the back triangle button the scripture i read have hyperlink that take me to other scripture and before on the old kindle i uld hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page i wa on e g if i wa on page and selected a link to page the back button would take me back to page with this kindle the back button take you back to the library and the previous page tap swipe take you back to the previous page e g if i m on page and i take a link to page it ll take me to page the work around that i disvered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time intensive than the old kindle back button the only other ncern i have is the battery life if i m going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation e g reading fantasy i ll probably use my old kindle if i want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different mmentaries e g scripture study the new kindle is the better bet the mmentaries i reference are pdfs i uld create a kindle book out of them but it mess up the table in the pdfs and i do not care for the pdf viewer that came with the kindle because you cannot bookmark the pdf or annotate it i purchased a very inexpensive pdf app called expdf reader which doe everything i want with pdfs all in all the kindle fire is a great tool and fit into my lunch box so i take it everywhere i read that others were ncerned about it is weight but i find it to be light i m used to reading door stopper book and it is definitely more manageable than one of those a pleasant surprise i had wa the blue shade feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle quality of sleep you do not need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old kindle so that is a nice perk too
should of did a little more research do not like the ad on the start screen
i bought the echo for my year old daughter she love it very useful and work great easy to use
my husband ha been a kindle fan from the first generation this one wa purchased on black friday for a disunted st and using bb point so it wa a great deal for a christmas gift given to my mother in law great intro level tablet and for someone who read more than work on their tablet
best small tablet on the market hand down easy bright great touch screen
remmend it to anyone always find something good to watch and very portable
i used this charger right away and my kindle is up and running i like the mpact size
bought this for my wife for christmas after reading the review hand down the best e reader for the price
it a nice product to use very light and a long battery life
we love the freetime setting for kid on the newer kindle fire i wa able to create a login for each of our kid a well a myself and set limit to the amount of device time they are allowed daily can set to more for weekend if desired you can set the age restriction for ntent also to avoid inappropriate ad etc once you have downloaded apps you can choose which one you want each child to have access to in their profile setting so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger sibling should not have basically i like that i can set their access right and know they re safe so i do not have to ntinually monitor every moment by the way freetime kid setting are available without having to subscribe to their freetime app access plan
love the worry free guarantee since this ha been dropped several time with that being said this tablet h held up
the tablet wa a gift and we are very happy with the standard option on the tablet it is easy to use ha a camera and is a great size
i have this and fire stick and a alexa mbine that with amazon prime and you have all you need
bought it a a toy for my daughter to play game and watch video
it wa very easy to set up work with my insteon system to turn on and off light fun to use new and weather update play your amazon prime music by mposer and or artist
if you want one of the most advanced alarm clock on the market then this is your device it work well calendar function play radio most podcasts can order domino is but you have to be aware that most feature require to some degree amazon prime membership for example spotify will not work unless it is a premium acunt

this is the third fire in our house now and they re all solid if unspectacular for the hardware cannot be beat but this newest version of the operating system is very clunky and not intuitive in the least once you get over th leading curve though it is a good way to keep the boy quiet on a plane

i have macular degeneration that make it difficult for me to to read the paperwhite allows me to set the font size large enough to read mfortably and the great back lighting really help also

i enjoy the new kindle only thing i would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading not sure how to stop that occurs nsistently also would like to stop the ad seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again that is bothersome otherwise am happy with the kindle
this is a great tablet lot of fun for the kid i recmend big time
i had a tough time finding review for this version of the tamron read several review mparing the nikon and the sigma equivalent to this lens previous version the main draw back for the original tamron mm wa some design issue like lack of weather proofing all those seem to be addressed from what i can see and have read i have not done a high end performance test with lor chart dissecting every bit of pixel like some article i read i can say that it work very well and the detail i get with my d is incredible i took the below shot at the zoo the weight can be off putting to some people but that me with the territory of any large lens and i do not see this one being anything out of the ordinary when it me to weight if you are like me and have been eyeing this lens for a while and over researching do yourself a favor and just go out and get it you wont be disappointed

i previously owned the fire hd and wa excited about the hd after getting the hd and using it i started to notice how they were able to cut sts the screen wa not a crisp the processor wa slower and the speaker were not a loud a previous version overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous version look elsewhere

this is great play music answer question keep my shopping list set a timer or alarm clock and soo much more only regret is that i didnbuy it sooner
i have tried roku and chromecast and wa not happy with either now have the fire tv and i m so pleased with how intuitive and clever it is plus the darn little thing is rock solid i have not had any glitch with it since the purchase and it is on all the time
i would remmend this to anybody who stream on line or u kodi
the bigger screen it so much better to do anything on game and movie are better because you can actually see them
i have had the echo since thanksgiving i love asking alexa question like movie showtime close by or current sport sres i also enjoy playing a round of jeopardy once in a while it make it easy to listen to the radio and to play just about any song i want even if i am not sure of the lyric it is one of those nveniences that you wonder how you did without it
not much else to say except this device replaced my aging apple tv i thought i d give it a shot a prime is not available yet on apple tv however this device is sharp picture reliability and nearly endless number of apps is absolutely outstanding
kindle fire is a great product also caught it at a special price it super fast and take great photo
uld answer weather question but struggled to answer anything else bought it for my father who is blind bing search engine terrible
got it on sale might have to get rid of my cable mpany

christmas gift for my niece they absolutly loved them
i spend more money taking my family out to dinner for a night than i spent on this wonderful little thing i picked up a rubber guard and screen protector from another big box retailer and have a perfect tablet for my two year old for le than buck this tablet ha a kid profile mode which make it perfect for your little one but also all the apps and great amazon accessibility for the adult i took a star off for the tiny amount of internal memory which get used up extremely quickly so i would definitely remmend a micro sd card and making sure you change the setting to store your apps on the card and not be internal memory otherwise no mplaints and several place on the internet will tell you how to use another big name app store to download your favorite
it wa easy to setup and fun to interact with alexa

this is a really great product if youre looking to start your smart home obviously this work best if you have an amazon prime acunt and even better if you subscribe to a few streaming service you can still stream plenty of free stuff a well
it is a reader wanted to get the cheeper one but you were out of stock this one work well
this did not fulfil all of my need but it is a great starting product
i love how easy the kindle is to operate it is very intuitive and requires only a short learning curve also it is one of the most enomical way to read book
the echo is a fun new tool to easily interface with the information highway but there is a learning curve to navigate in order to be able to get the most out of the echo sometimes echo doe not understand your request so you have to be able to restate certain request
i love alexa i use it mostly to play music and listen to the weather i have a slight lisp in my voice and she understands me perfectly where siri doe not the sound quality is remarkable and the volume the highest is incredibly loud we use it daily and would replace it if ever didnwork

i have not enuntered any issue with it so far i really like the screen mirroring capability because it let me project my miracast enabled window laptop and my galaxy is to the big screen it really cannoturn any tv into a smart tv
this paperwhite back lit kindle is wonderful no more itty bitty book light needed just turn on and read even at night and there is no glow during the daylight in addition i took it to the beach and read it there no glare unlike the ipad i had one of the early kindles so maneurving around the menu is different but easy to learn and get use to

pro inexpensive mpact device n lack of protective vers
i am happy to report that the kid are happy with their gift
bought this item for my grandson and now we both used it bright screen good wifi connection and memory expandable
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire give off too much glare to use in sunny nditions besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire since she read for hour on end that is a big plus the main drawback is that the graphic are not a clear with this reader all in all it wa money well spent
it very easy to work and doe very good good game my child love it he not but and find his way around on it
it allows me to have many apps and still take a good amount of picture without running out of storage
my grandbaby love hers we gave it a a christmas present
i bought this tablet a a gift for my mother in law who is not very tech savvy she already owns a laptop but wa interested in getting a tablet to use while watching tv rather than a whole laptop she also travel around quite a bit so having something light she uld take with her wa a big plus i have owned a uple amazon tablet before so i had an idea of how they worked and i wanted something at a low price point so i decided on this so far she love it a uple of important point the low price point me at the st of hardware after using my fire hdx this tablet felt just a little slow but not excessively so it performed better in basic task loading apps web browsing etc than i expected based on my experience with other tablet at similar price point a an amazon tablet this run a modified version of android but doe not have baked in access to google service including the google play store you will be restricted to amazon approved apps unless you sideload apps on your own or are able to get access to google service yourself popular apps like netflix skype and facebook are all present but the selection pale in mparison to native android
easy to follow direction allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder
love my new kindle it wa time to replace my old one everything is so much bet
i bought this tablet for my grandson in his birthday and he is sooo happy
nice tablet but it want you to put all your billing information in and a credit card to do all purchase is a hassle to pull up program because of this good for a child
this is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one work great and they can damage or mess up their own toy without using your cell phone or other adult device
my daughter had the fire stick at her home when i went to visit her i liked it so when i got back home i went and bought the fire tv box due to it having more memory it work great
my wife had a nook e reader that wa getting old and also used her iphone for reading i thought it would be a very good reader for her and she love it along with the other capability the tablet offer she ha been very happy with it and you cannot beat the price for the feature the tablet offer
this is a nice little tablet for me since i do not do a lot on a tablet it is a great size it took a little getting use to working with but am a little more mfortable with it now
the echo is a fun tech toy we do not have blue tooth light or heating ac but we have been having fun with the music and game
it is and i wa wondering to myself if i should jump on board and get a kindle paper white now and day people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablet the thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle book through my ipad after much researching and reading the review on here the paper white ha been the best purchase decision i have made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain this is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use battery life is amazing and only charge once every two week if you are just looking for a plain ereader then this gem is your best bet
yes most people have iphones and tablet to read on but i find it easier to focus and the new paperwhite screen is crystal clear in any light
love this tv box doe everything and even more everyone need one
great price useful and what i wa looking for uld not get the updated version yet but loved how this one operates and look
i bought and returned this item i wa hoping to be able to watch different sport game via the internet with the amazon fire tv but everything i selected stated it wa not available after trying different thing for a few day i figured i wa not going to get the result i wanted and returned the unit
this wa the best upgrade i have made i love the firestick but the box is much better
the amazon echo is a very nice addition it is kind of like siri without the need to hold a phone i have it paired with my wemo switch and so far it work great
i love my amazon fire tablet it doe exactly what i needed to do
one of the best tech item i have purchased in the last ten year
the tablet exceeds the price expectation great for reading book ok for browsing the time warner cable tv app work well with this device
do not waste your time with the fire stick get the box better remote and faster processor doe it job and great for kodi
great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button wa a surprise but a welme one
many great feature but the speaker doe not meet expectation i also have a google home i ended up putting the google home in the living room because the sound wa better and put the echo in the bedroom i would also think it would be nice to have a plug to attach a speaker you can use blue tooth but if your going to use a dedicated speaker to improve sound it would be nice to have the option
this is such a great invention i mainly use it to play my music
this echo simplifies my daily life activity and is worth every penny
i have one myself and i bought more a christmas gift while they were on sale sometimes alexa ha a hard time giving you the answer i guess i have to work on how i have to ask to get the rrect response otherwise i enjoy alexa echo
love my new reader it took a while to sort out all of the function a it is quite different from my old kindle now however it go with me everywhere i especially like the back light that make reading always easy
i like it but what i dont like are the ad that hide a screen saver intrusive
great device much faster than the amazon fire stick
alexa is a great gift have given to family and friend always a great feedback
a must have to charge your kindle work very well
this watch is not only very useful it is very cute and mfortable i love the fitness aspect it motivates me to be more active i also enjoy the smartwatch ability i can read my text message without anyone knowing it also the battery last a few day at the very least
i love my new echo i have it sync with my android and echo will add item to your calendar set alarm and even tell you a joke it keep getting better and better
great price for a good product so far so good and no issue wish they had more apps but great nonetheless great for gift for family member
this is a great little tablet the price is right and it offer a clear picture with good speed for browsing the web the interface with amazon is perfect great for kid and adult too plenty of fun lors to choose from
for what the kindle fire doe at it is practically a steal the reason why i bought the fire wa because it is excellent read aloud function there are many book that do not me in audiobook format which i need i do not have a much time a i would like to sit down and read these day the kindle fire ha allowed me to finally get to these book while i m working out or driving good point it read aloud very well with several fairly natural sounding voice amazon can nvert most pdfs into a readable format and you can change the speed battery last pretty wellbad point the fire is o uld use some reworking switching bluetooth on and off is not exactly nvenient being buried under a few menu which do not seem to be customizable all in all it is a great buy at
the amazon echo is a terrific tech addition these device work off your router and the vast variety of information and radio station make the echo a versatile item to have
i wa replacing a first generation kindle i love the slim size and the improved access to the internet amazon underground and my library the ad do not bother me once i open my kindle
i purchased this product because of family member and i m so glad i did
best purchase ever would remmend to anyone it is the best
we wanted i good inexpensive table to get our foot wet this is a good one if you are mfortable getting your apps from amazon i do find the processor to be a little slow at time
bought this a a gift for my mom and this wa to replace her original kindle fire she is have had a month now and is loving and no problem with it
we all really like alexa especially when oking you just ask her a question without having to get your phone out music is great to listen to also
easy enough for my yr old to use great deal
great tablet great quality i liked and for the price it great
i bought a kindle fire it serf my purpose of reading pdf file
i absolutely love alexa she can now play from my itunes library when connected to my phone via bluetooth she is remarkable and i would choose alexa over google voice
mainly use it for playing music wa going to connect to apple music but found it much easier to use amazon music and amazon offer a lower priced plan if you just use amazon music for alexa i have an outlet switch connected which is nvenient for turning on off light it ha a good speaker for playing music i think alexa is mparable to siri
i got this for a cheap tablet and i love having it

solid product by amazon for streaming with various service
i used to use an amazon fire tv stick which worked fine a friend remmended trying the fire tv because it wa faster and had the ability to have more storage tried it and have not looked back since
bought this specifically to take to the beach and it wa perfect light weight portable
brought for christmas gift mother love it use all time
i purchased this for my wife for her birthday she love it
my granddaughter love her kindle fire tablet easy to use and am purchasing one for my husband
the product ha a price tag and the warranty is too short my tablet died within a month i took it to best buy where they said they do not handle the warranty went to amazon web site where they said go to the store where i bought the device after much digging around amazon web site i found out who would help me i gave it a one star and amazon helped me quick we were able to get it going again a manual would help the device work again i found the tablet to be very functional i watch netflix listen to spotify watch youtube video it work great
bought this to see the difference from google is product wa not happy google wa more responsive and easier to use returned product day later
the higher dpi and built in backlight made this a fantastic upgrade from my previous kindle touch
performance up to expectation but battery life le than expected and advertised backlight function well
great way of upgrading to a smart tv le the price tag
perfect fit for what i wa needing might get another soon
i have purchased a few of these item they are perfect for getting rid of tv
ha ton of free game for the kid not so good for the average tablet user a it not that powerful but i guess that is only my opinion
my wife and i uld not be happier with our amazon echo with our home wifi it wa so easy to setup alexa what did we ever do without you look if your looking at review then you have done some research and know what the echo is all about and all it can do do not hesitate buy it now
pretty happy with the fire over the firestick really enjoying the k stream
my kid love this tablet especially to watch their youtube video easy to use and ha a great feature that dims the screen brightness i set the timer to dim b w pm and am so that if my son watch it in bed it wont keep him awake easy to use
reasonably priced and worth every penny i love it
it is get for my and year old boy and they love them
need to have better info for special need child the kid utube is nfusing but love the guarantee
i needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stay so i decided based on price to get the kindle and i am pleased i did for only the bright picture sound storage and ease of use is well worth it
lot of stuff available to add to enhance performance
a waste of money you do not need this just plug your tablet into your mputer and the charge last for a month
great product the smart home integration is amazing
the fire box is just what i wanted it let me not worry about missing my favorite show and movie
nice and good tablet to do basic thing like surfing
good box but menu slow when booting up and ntrol loses sync at time
bought a a gift and they love it great for the price
purchased for a friend year old the parental ntrols are great and the price wa more than reasonable for this kind of gift
love it amazing easy to use love the look sound amazing
i wa worried at first since it wa cheap but i m loving it more and more everyday in fact i went out and bought another for a christmas gift for a family member easy gift and you can use hbo go and netflix the only negative is there wa no blue tooth just a fyi it is the th gen g amazon fire
alexa is great when asking about the weather or when wanting to play some music quickly however majority of the question i ask it cannot find i think that the question are pretty simple too she will answer question with direct answer like whats but if you go much further she wont respond
this is an excellent product it will do everything expected and perform it well voice regnition is excellent great for people of all age from year old to or more
great sound for such a small speaker learns from what you tell it
great medium player for the kid video streaming is great and fun game to keep them occupied expand the memory with an sd card
ton of value if you want a budget tablet look no further
fire is still a good tablet and a great tablet for the price
i wa looking for an inexpensive tablet that would be fast cheap and do simple thing a reading internet and music so far it is been great and on top of it amazon released an update that add alexa to the tablet so now you can ask question to it do note ask her to order you item and also get her to play music from pandora spotify etc great buy
this is an older tablet i probobly expected too much if i m going to deal with lagginess i prefer my ipad
very little set up amazon helpful in setting up the function clear picture and easy to use take picture both way
the fire tv wa so that i do not have to use cable or satellite and it is working
i bought this for reading but love the extra work great great reading option
i got this for a christmas gift for my daughter this is the send one i have gotten for her the first one is starting drop word and she ha to download book several time in order to finish reading she diid a lot of research before she asked for the paperwhite i am sure she will love it o
nice product cannot figure how to erase message on alexa app
i find the overall function of the system to be good the far field feature work well the one thing i find to be weak is the speaker the sound during play back of music is not crisp nor clean you uld purchase the dot and connect it to another speaker for better sound save some money on the unit this way a well
we love this very helpful and entertaining useful for automation is an awesome feature alexa is great for the young and old play your music get weather news update among many other option including game
i have way more buffering with this device than i do with my apple tv gen it work just not well i have a glitch with this unit every time i use it that indeed take away from the user experience
an amazing piece of equipment doe many entertaining thing
bought the tablet on black friday to replace a year old nexus liked it so much that i purchased another a week later at full price bright clear screen good battery life expandable memory fast and easy to use no mplaints
i think this item is great i got rid of my cable
i watch everything on this now from movie to sport and ur everyday news
definitely the best amazon streaming device star
apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing i m telling you generic tablet are faster i thought it wa my internet at first but all my other device work phenomenally fast i first noticed this after i started using it but i thought i would give it a shot i have decided to return this and exchange for another tablet tomorrow this is because i uld not even watch a simple youtube video today here is what i did like it is name brand the game are nice and mostly ad free it u android but u their own app store reading book is great library app is kinda slow but still work perfect cheap tablet for kid age to maybe
good starter tablet for beginner or child good quality for the price
i purchased this to replace my first gen paperwhite the shadow on the bottom of the paperwhite always bothered me i decided to upgrade to the voyage and it is much better i like the physical page turn button the higher dpi and the nsistent back lighting i think the only issue i have with the voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and i sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually but that is a small issue for an otherwise great e reader
this tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the wifi doe not work well the wifi turn off and i have to manually reset it over and over the camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my need doe not make sense why there is not a version without camera with a bigger screen size
i love my echo she would be amazing if she uld google thing but we cannot have it all love that the kid cannotell alexa to put something on the list and it show up on my phone
i remmend this speaker easy to work great sound
love the product it doe good for what my child need it to do
easy stocking stuffer or gift exchange reasonably priced also
this product wa extremely easy to set up and use the whole family enjoys asking question and the clarity of the speaker is great we love the ability to link it to other smart product throughout the house
great tablet lot of feature good memory and quick response when connected to wifi
is a great first tablet for a beginner or child
first i would like to say i own ipads iphone and many thing apple send i also own many android device the main reason for this tablet wa to take advantage of the lending library that me amazon prime over all i would purchase this over an ipad mini any day just for the value alone at first i thought the display would not be up to snuff mpared to my ipad but for movie and reading it wa good enough that it doe not take away from the experience however there are a few annoying feature that are on but can and should be turned off the on deck is a great feature but i would have liked to have known it wa downloading ton of movie in the background eating up space and bandwidth a better function would have been to let u choose what to download instead of getting movie willynilly be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow and you ll be thinking the tablet is slow ok on to kindle for reading unfortunately reading is not a great a i thought it would be because it doe not allow scrolling work on kindle device but not on kindle fire device if you do not mind flipping the page then you wonhave a problem but for me can read much faster by scrolling one last point most of the apps are not a polished under the amazon store a in the google play store i know this because i have an nexus phone and mpared them for example the hue app doe not even work from amazon store anyway this point should not deter you from buying it cause there are solution
perfect for the kiddos both for entertainment and educational enjoyment definitely best tablet for the price
wa a present for my year old grandson he wa very pleased

if you have amazon prime this is simply another way gaining more ntent if you are a cable cutter there is also the added plus of adding xbmc and getting additional ntent for ntent free

i love the fire kindle tablet this is my rd kindle nd fire the new fire is so much easier to use a a tablet plus nothing beat a kindle for reading book this fire is much easier to use than my husband is samsung tablet
this is my first e reader the screen ha a nice feel to it it read really well i do not like the fact that amazon ha total ntrol of your purchase i do not like the amazon free unlimited book trial they do not allow access to certain title so far i am able to find most of my book selection i will be creating my own reading list and want zero input from amazon the battery life seam to be awesome of urse when you shut it off ad pop up the kindle claim that it doe not take up battery to display these ad but they seem to mysteriously change on their own even when it is turned off strange it is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one kindle paperwhite i like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse yet big enough to read the font is adjustable too if you need bigger letter
great way to get kid introduced to using a tablet a ton of free software is available guarantee seal the deal
bought for a friend and checked it out after purchase is a very neat machine
item is a described and i have enjoyed the ease of use
this is one of the best buy for the price amazon outdid themselves with this one for what you get for the price this is an excellent gift
absolutely love it it small and you can read outside with it it is a great buy
this is an excellent choice for an e reader i purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun it did a great job wa easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun the backlit display at night wa very nice and make reading a breeze anytime without problem i have an older nook book that is lor i chose the amazon version so that i uld subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program in mparison between the brand i do like the nook better for easy of moving between page i have not figured that out quite yet on the kindle but i m sure it is quite easy there is also no person that i can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something if you are a person who like being shown how to use a device i know my mom who is might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but of the people most likely wonbest thing i like and am glad i invested wa the backlight
great product small and barely noticeable on top of my dvd player
it doe what is say it doe on the box in this day and age that is something to take note of
good product a little hard to set up must be close to wifi alexa app is not user friendley
work well easy to use battery seems to be good would buy again
it ha been great for the whole family we all love playing our favorite music and the kid love the game like question
great everyday simple web surfing and apps on this tablet for the price good to used it on the plane and watch movie or video processor not a fast a your premium ipad
we got of these tablet in black friday for a great price it a pro if you have amazon prime since everything around this tablet is amazon base shopping video book and alexa
the kindle fire work really well for my sone he is learning a lot
cannot wait to pair with smart item a little large but ok
really loving the fitbit blaze so far it reminds me to keep pushing and motivates me to stay active the feature are awesome and battery life is amazing i definitely remmend this watch to someone looking to start being active ntinue to be active or push their limit great investment fyi it is a fitness watch not a true smartwatch
love this e reader only mplaint is the swipe to turn page wish it wa an on screen button
it perfect i love my alexa doe everything i want it to do
it is a very reliable tablet for the little one most enjoyable feature is how you can ntrol everything they look at and what kind of apps they use
upgrade from old kindle reader whose charger quit working android system easy to use
we bought these for the kid and they just love them with the parental ntrols on it we do not have to worry about where they go on the internet
love my kindle good idea to save some space around the house the size is great for my bad eye
i got this to replace my samsung tablet i read alot and so i figured that the kindle would be ok to use i have found that it work great with the book that i read and i really like the blue light feature making it easier to fall asleep reading
work well it wa easy to set up my only mplaint is that it is a hassle to load application that do not me with it i loaded xfinity to go on it and it wa very difficult to use a it doe not fit the screen right great idea too many glitch with new software i would remmend getting a mini bluetooth keyboard it wa easy to connect and work well with this
we re streaming k ntent from our app and we wanted to test the quality of streaming fire tv worked great streaming k
this device is incredible it can pick up on your voice from across the room and ha yet to make a mistake about what i asked
i tried the roku but the fire tv wa just more flexible and the menu wa easier to navigate
wow it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carry ton of book no distraction like on my ipad with email message pinging in and facebook update to check just book and lot of them the kindle voyage is everything they said it would be light back lit with self adjusting level page turner all the bell and whistle i am so glad i waited and splurged for this one
i wa hesitant at first about this but it turn out to be more than i expected my only mplaint is not getting it sooner
the glass on top of the reader is absolutely a slick and beautiful piece added on what is already an excellent device worth the extra
although not the greatest tablet on the market when mpared to apple or samsung product but when you weight in the price it is worth the purchase
bought for my yr old grandson it is great easy for him to use i have an gb myself love the amazon fire the price is very affordable
it no ipad or samsaung but it work i dont have a problem with it and the price wa great on black friday
the best service ever and and knowledge of product
the amazon echo is a great tool for home automation work with nest device tp link wall plugins and various other item with ease
like the music at your mmand we keep in the kitchen everyone in the family can add to grocery list that alexa app on our phone reminds u what to pick up at store
have used other streaming device this is by far the best and easiest to use good tool to help cut the cable rd
this item wa very easy to hook up and use there are a variety of free movie to watch
the screen picture is crisp and bright i will use this tablet for many thing
i love my firestick but the box is so much better
love this product good sound and easy to use
died after day day out of warranty some no name brand lasted u year before this one figured we would get a name brand thinking that it will last longer i wonbe purchasing kindle amazon product anymore
my niece loved it i love that it is designed especially for kid she
bought a birthday present for grandson and he play with it daily and with the case on it he ha not broken it either
great size easy to carry for traveling need to spend more time looking into apps for contact manegement interactive calender and most important music storage and use
the echo is all that we expected use a speaker music in the kitchen
a great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who like ti play game and read book
we like using the echo for quick answer and for playing mucic the only reason that i didngive it star is because while listening to music loudly it cannot hear your voice to turn down or to stop playing so you have to manually turn the volume down
would remmend this to others better than kindle fire of best
it is unfair for me to rate this product cause i have not even taken it out of the box to set it up
my old kindle wa on it last leg and i needed a multi finctional tablet that wa also a reader the kindle fire fit the bill excellentlty
i will start with the disclaimer i am not an amazon prime member i have a feeling this tablet really roar around within the ap environment instead i purchased it to watch youtube video netflix and hulu show read a few digital book and maybe other stuff down the road yes there is an app for hulu and netflix and youtube but the netflix app stopped seeing my memory card and a reinstall didnfix it this mean i cannot download video to the gb card i bought i figured i should be able to move file back and forth but that doe not work no way to move the ntent to the card so i have gb unusable for netflix and am stuck loading on the gb internal memory when i take this thing on the road i will have to rely on wifi to replenish title along the way the picture is good though bright enough and clear sound is just ok and i am disappointed by the top volume through both the speaker and the headphone jack it barely cut above the fan from my ac i plan on adding a bluetooth speaker at some point but am guessing i will run into a similar issue how to get more volume at i am plenty happy with the device but it should use android aps better i know amazon want me on prime but i should still get the best experience possible
this is my first kindle but i m loving it i picked it up a few day after it wa released one of the thing i love the most is i m a reader but i am not a car owner so i get almost everywhere by bike i got tired of lugging around heavy hardver book from the library now my voyage weighs le than most paperback book an extra bonus for me is it fit in a pocket i wa not using in my pannier i carry stuff to work everyday i love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipe i also love that i charged it when i got day ago and it is still more than have battery power
easy intuitive set up excited to see new update

my yr old just love it keep her occupied for hour
exactly what i wa looking for size wise and functional
i use the device while riding a stationary bike and elliptical trainer perfect for that use when using it other time i would prefer a larger screen but this is a very good lower st item
the amazon echo is both practical and fun i use it for my sirius xm streaming music i check the weather often and i use it to tease my cat by asking alexa to meow there are so many answer to question and an abundance of information that alexa can provide these are only a fraction of all the thing that the echo can do love the echo

enjoy the performance and size of the television we purchased we are very satisfied with this product
this ha been a tremendous item i m so glad i did my research and picked this piece for online television
not an ipad but an excellent value satisfied with purchase
for the longest time i had been using a kindle keyboard which wa good for it time until the rd gen paperwhite came along the decision wa a no brainer especially with the dpi lighted screen and at the same reasonable price i have gotten used to using the touch screen mpared to the physical turn page button although every now and then the screen should be wiped to remove oil from our skin that accumulate there is always something for everyone in the kindle store
it help me keep my schedule and perfect to listen to music

this is the best overall value among all kindle reader the built in light feature is must have
gave a a gift recipient wa thrilled with their new echo
it is good device with respect to technology and automating house hold electronics but personally i like google home more than amazone echo
got this for the wife and she love it easy to switch user also
perfect gift for christmas after receiving it i ordered another one
the kindle paperwhite is a great device for reading in all lighting nditions the battery life is amazing last for week without charge it also syncs easily to your amazon acunt some n about the device is that it is a bit on the slow side when your shopping around for book on the device and i wish it came with a headphone jack for whispersync
i have to say this wa not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it is greatest product feature which is the ability to return it for a full refund we wanted a smaller tablet for our kid well this is smaller in every way option are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kid use our tablet so we can buy the newest one this thing may go back to the store a soon a tonight
my niece and nephew love it even my yr old usin got one and he is thrilled about it really easy to use
i got it a a gift for mom she love it it is not to mplicated
first off you cannot go wrong with the price or if you can even catch it on sell is a steal for any piece of tech now i have seen people mpare this to an ipad or samsung tablet which you cannot this doe not have retina display or anything like that but for the price point it doe a good job i have had mine since the black firday sell and it still been working really good i also got one for my mom and my nephew i generally use mine for email and amazon order along with reading the time to time book netflix and the few game that i have purchased my mom and nephew use it mainly to play game if your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod feature and do not mind the extra or buck by all mean i suggest getting one of the higher end tablet but i cannot mplain with this new amazon fire a it work just a good for me i d remmend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space
this wa a present for my father and he ha not mplained one bit about it
glad i got this kindle cannotake it with me and i can actually see the screen
the nstant bombardment of ad when i turn on my tablet is not an experience that i enjoy i would remmend you buy any other than one that run the fire o for the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it
this is a great product and for the st it exceeded my expectation i would remmend this to anyone wanting to carry their book llection all in one device

i love alexa she is amazing she doe everything i ask her she wake me up play my playlist from amazon unlimited music perfectly i like it so much i bought my fiance one thanks for the amazing product amazon
really nice product surprise about how great and fast it work
i use this item mostly for music but i love alexa she is very knowledgeable the downside is you have to use the alexa app for some functionality but i do not mind i just do not like that you have to say the app when using some skill like alexa use tracker to find my phone instead of alexa find my phone you have to remember what the skill name are
my year old daughter really like it it is friendly and easy to use

love the echo awesome tone to the sound very easy to use i can use this paired thru bluetooth with my iphone or i can simply ask alexa question i can access my music from my spotify or spotify in general and various other source my only remmendation for new product would be to have this be able to be on the charger and then portable not connected to a wall outlet like the smaller version can be on the charger however i had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything the echo you can just talk to it across the room which make it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha i received this a a birthday gift and i really am enjoying it highly remmend it

we bought a send tv so we needed another firetv box it work great with the service we re using
i love the sound the sleekness and help with question the music she play while im in the kitchen oking no more cd is or tape i have her sister the dot in another room i use her for an alarm clock i think every one should have one
love my echo listening to my favorite station is great it ha a great sound
my son wa the first in the family to buy it then he introduced it to me to his sister and now we all having a great time enjoying the little box
easy to setup more than acceptable performnces i use the device to check email play surfing the web and i never have any problem excellent price
i use to login to my mputer and search now i just ask alaxa and have an answer soon than i uld type
excellent item
so far we are very much enjoying the product great for outdoor use by the pool due to it portability we have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a uple hour ha been no problem only catch is that you cannot stream a single spotify acunt on more than one device at the same time so if you find yourself purchasing the dot or echo you will not be able to stream using the same acunt at the same time

i have owned kindle is for many year and have always been very happy with their portability performance and ease of use the highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this kindle for my son there are only two area that i am very disappointed the first in the parental ntrol setting in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one touch purchase and i mean one easy little touch i must set the ntrols either off or on the problem with this is that he then ha no internet access or extremely limited access so limited that he cannot access ntent i normally allow him to access big problem now amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchase there is a cancel button but then you must wait day or more for the refund to be credited this is an issue that i am getting more frustrated with a we move through time with this purchase the send issue amazon is kindle app store is weak if you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device such a facebook a major app and a major downfall to kindle use because of this last issue both my son and i have apple device to supplement what we cannot do on our kindle all this being said however my son and i both very much enjoy what the kindle is do have to offer so they get a good rating because of this however because of the issue i discussed it wa difficult to choose between an average and good rating
i like the ipad it very helpful my son ha learned alot and i hope that it will help other kid too a they prepare for pre k
like this to stream but would be nice to have kodi support without hack
they just keep getting better this is great for the beginner or pro
i know this is not ipad or samsung tab nor i wa expecting this tablet to get any close to any of them but boy for this tablet rock i toss it in my car gym bag and i am not afraid to toss it around great durability great value for money you cannot go wrong with this highly remmended
i chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use a an ereader it ha not disappointed
it is great i like it very much i can find anything you want
this is my first e reader ever and it is amazing the text is so crisp there is not a pixel to be seen the device is fast and i have not seen any problem in my last month of owning it battery life is decent i use the backlight a lot so it doe not last a long a it would without but it is still great i love how you can borrow ebooks from overdrive and download them on your kindle easy peasy kindle unlimited offer a good selection of free book for a monthly fee and there is a day free trial overall an amazing e reader skip the cheaper version without the backlight you re gonna need it

good tablet for the price and excellent for kid
good tablet and great buy mpact size allows you to use one hand and use anywhere

probably the best priced tablet on the market work well
bought one a few month ago and after our nventional kindle died replaced it with the fire and it is amazing bought them for my kid for the holiday
this wa a gift bought because i have had one for year and am mpletely happy with everything about it
my child loved their previous kindles so much i bought them an upgrade with the case so worth it
i bought this for my year old it ha endured all that a year old would and uld give it
before i switched to the kindle white i wa using barnes and noble nook which had several down side mpared to the kindle kindle battery last a long time mpared to the nook kindle doe not jump page like the nook nook is very sensitive to touch and cause a lot of nfusion when trying to find where you left off reading my husband and i are very happy that we switched to kindle especially since you have a greater selection of reading material through amazon
i would remmend this to you this product is really light and portable you can carry it to cafã or library for reading there is no harm to your eye because of it specific technology the only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page but this is the mmon problem for this kind of reading stuff i think it is acceptable i bought on the price of with a disunt so it really worth it
highly remmend this to anyone who love music
this is my first kindle paperwhite great battery life and best e paper tablet
this replaced an original fire stick it work good enough for u to cancel our cable tv if it is not amazon prime netflix hulu or the antenna we do not need to see it
very responsive i purchased the phillips light bulb and alexa ntrols them brightness and lor learning what alexa can do take time but well worth the effort
i uld not be happier with this purchase lot of entertainment in one small package
i bought the echo after falling in love with the echo dot the functionality of the speaker is fantastic and the sound quality is much better on this speaker than the dot all in all a great speaker that is fun to use
definitely enjoy using this at home i wa surprised at how intuitive it is and wa able to answer any question in sends i mostly use it to play music through amazon player i know there is ton more it can do and cannot wait to take advantage of all it capability
too small for me page turning nstantly due to size page refresh jumpy irritating to my eye
i bought hardest part wa going from io to learning to use the kindle fire my daughter and brother love it
i have purchased other tablet such a a kurio for kid and this is by far the best it ha all the apps you need a an adult great for both adult and kid to read book and great visuals only bad thing like my old kindle fire the micro usb portion get loose

this device work great for streaming tv i use it with playstation vue just download the app and you are ready to go easy to use and alexa help out
easy to use doe great job of adjusting the background light for reading take a little adjustment from my old keyboard kindle but not a problem
amazon fire tv is better then fire stick roku streaming is too fast you will not notice any delay
only star because i found it very nfusing at first i had a kindle before found it very easy to find what i needed to do the user guide didnreally answer my question but i persisted am getting used to it i really love the backlit screen no button to push to change page at first i wa not sure about the smaller screen but didntake long to get over that i m sure i m just a creature of habit not very techy all in all the kindle paperwhite is great
if you want a good e reader amazon ha a number of option but some of the newer one are unexpectedly expensive this one is great if you want to read any time but not break the bank
great but need more work to be worth the money very limited in what can be asked in a form of question you have to ntinually down load skill in order to ask question related to topic this is very taxing and spending time doing it make you just say forget it hopefully this will be fixed soon really should have purchased the google one but oh well
i bought this for my mother for christmas and she absolutely love it originally i thought of the idea for her to read on so she uld make the font larger but now she is using it for so many other thing she is a happy mom

i have been using both roku embedded into lg tv and the amazon fire tv the true winner is the amazon fire tv since it always work very fast a expected no issue no bug the roku instead is slower take time to react and load ntent i mainly use netflix and youtube amazon fire tv delivers outstanding menu navigation and fast response while searching navigating through ntent movie tv show video also amazon fire tv is always on and ready and you cannotake advantage of alexa to use your voice to mmand useful from time to time
brought this a a gift for a friend and she love it
i absolutely love the kindle paperwhite it is my first e reader but it is won me over i had to choose between the kindle and the nook each had it is advantage and the only reason that the kindle won out wa because of my obsessive usage of amazon i do not like that it u a proprietary format other format are usable such a pdf but there are workarounds out there the screen is crisp and look just like paper i barely notice the e ink refreshing and i can read for hour without dismfort the built in light is great for night reading and it is so light overall a great device and if you can wait there are price drop fairly often would buy again
i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this wa actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any review on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it doe everything the echo doe but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it is ok the low are there but doe not sound good i m guessing i m mparing it with the bose mini soundlink when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mids and high are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying mmands where a with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your mmands i do like the fact that it is portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model me out with better bass
great for reading love the selection of apps to choose from
great price for a great tablet perfect for the kid
great product lot good appsmpatible with many appsloves the speed and quality of priduct for the money
i like it my son can watch his favorite show with out any problem
i bought it for the option with the smart home integration i am quite pleased with the rd party integration with nest lutron and others i am not so into the skill with game that it offer it seems to be the best on the market so far
i have had a few kindle is in the past so this wa nothing new for me but what i loved about this one is that the screen is big so when i am reading a book it is a lot easier than when i had the first kindle screen i mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when i want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search review on a book before purchasing i love it

the kindle paperwhite is mpact yet big enough to feel book sized the natural bridge screen is quite easy on your eye and is visible in any light quite an acmplishment the battery charge last a long time so you do not feel in danger of the paperwhite going dead on you when i went to guatemala i wa even able to find a browser that allowed me to get a message back home on my email using the paperwhite i got this one for my wife if you like to read i think you would enjoy this little gem

great product for the kid gaming apps parental ntrols to make sure you can monitor kid and prevent unwanted app purchase

i love this little speaker it is small enough to carry it wherever i want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard the alexa interface is pretty ol a well the only issue for me is that it doe not connect with apple music this issue is easily resolved by putting tap in bluetooth mode and playing apple music through my phone to the tap
great for the price get a screen protector though
alexa will tell you the weather immediately in addition music of your liking is available in sends your voice mmand even ntrols the decibel level

literally rock besides the home automation capability tied in with my harmony hub and my smartthings hub echo is a great sounding speaker that will play you million of song from amazon prime music
i like this tablet but you need to register a credit card to get free apps
we get what we paid for but at this machine is much better than any of the cheap tab that are in market the screen resolution and the performance is pretty decent for this grade of tablet

this is a great inexpensive disposable tablet it doe run on amazon is fire o which is based on android and designed for amazon is app store technically you can side load it with other android apps to get around some of the restriction limitation should you desire if you are a big amazon prime fan often using amazon video music doing amazon shopping or need an inexpensive yet still very functional tablet then just get it for the price you cannot beat it if you are expecting a big major functioning tablet that u the google play store or is mparable to an apple ipad that is x the price then this is not for you but you wonfind that in this price range
the kindle voyager ha a very easy to read screen with great resolution
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play game on it
we have several alexa unit throughout our home and love the way it will ntrol light tv and thermostat
bought for my husband birthday but i really wanted for my self it is fantastic
the tablet offered my son hour and hour of ntinuous learning and excitement he would not put it down until it went dead and the battery had to be recharged
hard to argue with an amazon fire tv or stick i bought this to replace my previous one that only did p having had both i would say you wongo wrong with either i bought the firetv for the direct internet plug in capability which i figured would be a ncern with wifi
very easy to use excellent sound for music listening able to use it to ntrol all my smart home item highly remmend

price is right my kid love this tablet like more
i decided i need a device dedicated to my amazon acunt so i purchased this i have been using my iphone and ipad but wanted to have a device specifically for book i have had kindles before and the product are so good
i should have waited until this wa more advanced it keep disnnecting from the wifi and it is a pain to reboot it doe not know much either we have only had it week so we will see how it grows with u
you will never be lonely again she talk to you and answer question she can read your kindle book too and tell you the weather she will tell you joke she is well worth the money also play music from your library and ihart radio and much more thing

average good playibg game ha a tendency to freeze
it work perfect with all the android apps fast and never freeze or anything no problem at all
this wa a gift for my mom and she really like it however there are not a lot of apps to use with it
for the price this tablet is great doe what is needed and it sleek
perfect for kid to play read online through wi fi touch response is a bit slow
this thing is great so much better than the appli tv we got
we love our amazon echo and alexa we are still new to it and are learning it is capability but so far we absolutely live it i m thinking we will enjoy it even more a we take advantage of more feature
wa told by sale person i uld me back in a week with receipt to get off black friday price customer service lady said they do not do that i wa misled item itself is okay
i recently bought this on sale at best buy for on black friday and uld not be happier while i wanted primarily an e reader which this doe very well i also use my new th generation fire for facebook cnbc fox and cnn news update alexa query and occasional email i added a gig micro disk and now store all my amazon e book on it and yes you can save all your e book onto the micro disc just read the documentation a it is easy to do while the silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it work just fine for my need i also added two security apps via the amazon app store to keep me protected they seem to work well so far the screen resolution is acceptable for my need and while i have not downloaded any movie yet i m nfident they will play well i should also add that i had to separately download an update from amazon to install alexa while doing i needed to call amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric responsive and helpful
nice price for a gift idea at the time small mpact version of alexa
i asked my alexa to put on the music what time and date and put my shopping list oh and how to spell think
i bought this device and put it in my new theater room i love the game and streaming i have yet to upgrade to k through netflix but i am excited to try it out on here when i do i am just waiting for a bit more ntent
yes i did it got me alexa best thing ever nice to get music
purchased of these to gift to my granddaughter and they absolutely love them it is just the right size for them to mfortable hold
i have a nd generation kindle andst generation kindle fire i hardly use those now i also have an ipad mini and an ipad air i like the kindle paperwhite because it is just for reading and so small it hardly take up any room in my purse i enjoy reading novel on the kindle pw especially with the backlight more than i like reading on my ipad now
brought for my worker daughter for christmas and she love it he said it her best gift
amazon fire tv ha faster processor and more memory than firestick which make the guide and navigation much faster have sling tv app installed and scrolling through menu etc is really fast would remmend this to other people nsidering amazon firestick to choose this instead
i am building out a relatively large advanced smart home and it wa only natural to integrate voice assistant feature to the mix i use the echo to ntrol phillips hus light and even my schlage lock every morning i wake up and get news and weather from alexa a i m getting ready what a wonderful product
this tablet is great for entertainment purpose especially if you are an amazon prime member easy to use and access to most entertainment apps make this tablet and easy purchase especially if you get it on sale for le than great buy
this product is nvenient for listening to music hand free but not real user friendly alexa is not real knowledgeable and logic is at best that of a small child
this replaced a year old kindle for my year old mother extremely glad i went with another kindle and the fire is awesome resolution is great doe everything needed and with ease
last year i bought other tablet and this year this one it is really a better then any other brand
bought echo a gift for my senior dad it is terrific entertaining a little difficult to install set up the sound quality voice regnition are amazing
u can do so much with this tablet mpare to the more expensive one
purchased for a little guy and i am very pleased with it
great product very easy to use installed kodi on it and love it
i purchased this tablet to take to my class it is very mpact and handy
there is not much difference in the regular kindle wait till it go on sale
this is a gift to my wife for xmas do not know yet if she like it but i cannot see why she would not
i m not big reader since the purchase i have been reading a lot more even recipies i love this kindle my boyfriend bought one the exact same time then bought some cute case for them
my wife owns one so we bought one for my mom who is not tech savvy and she seems to be having great success with it so far had to buy a case separately because for some reason best buy doe not have any avail in store or even on line but the fire itself is great for light user
love the echo great for listening to music and quick information
what can one say it charge my kindle
like always a timely delivery we have had these item before and we re purchased
i have bought of these tablet for my great grand child excellent for learning and u do not use data
enjoying the kindle reading watching movie playing game
great product that is easy to install and setup it doe not me with an hdmi cable so be sure to have one handy on a side note your email with get spam ntinuously with amazon advertisement to be sure to unsubscribe a soon a you can
the technology just keep getting better and better
this is without a doubt the best streaming device on the market like the fire stick i have also purchased many of these device for friend and family the one i like more obviously because of the higher price and i have had zero issue with any of them these are capable of doing everything you want them to do just like the fire stick but better and faster and possibly in k if you have the ntent and technology to support it
what can you say for buck i got great gift love them
work great purchased a holiday gift for year old grandmother
great selection hard to find assistance at time
very user friendly occasionally when i m switching back and forth between source there is no picture only sound so i have to turn it off and back on not sure if the problem is with the fire tv
the sale person wa very helpful and informative
at this moment perfect and close to book ereader in today world your eye wonharm you nice deal in bestbuy
i have the fire stick and added the fire tv the fire tv is noticeable faster than the fire stick and more reliable if you like the amazon interface which i do go for the speed
but you cannot beat the price normally these were on sale for for black friday so i picked up a gift
it is a nice tablet to have however i do not like the setup for making a kid profile and not being able to download to their profile also do not like amazon is charge for a kid profile
i like this tablet very much for the price i uld not ask for more very user friendly very kid friendly too
after trying apple tv i m happy with amazon fire the remote is great and easy set up
i have one of the original kindles i believe it the send version with no back light so i thought i might like this one although i still prefer paper book for the most part this is a nice addition i think however that it should st le for what it doe
i love this easy to set up and easy to use would remmend it for sure
for the price of this box you really cant go wrong
i purchased this tablet for my mother for the camera reading book and emailing awesome price and value
great little box that doe cut the cable streaming almost all of those service are on the box and seem to work fine on it
the integration with crestron home automation platform make the echo a very useful tool
i really didnknow what to expect when i picked up an echo i understood that it wa a wifi bluetooth enabled speaker that had siri like capability but it really ended up being so much more truly you can hand free do everything from get basic info that you would normally look up on google to ntrolling your connected home to resupplying toilet paper through amazon of urse it ha it novelty item like telling you joke to singing you happy birthday truly this is the beginning of having an iron man home just need some fine tuning in it voice regnition and more feature excited to see what amazon add to it in the future
prime integration is smooth and voice regnition is much better than siri
the amazon echo is the most amazing device you can add to your home it make everything more nvenient i highly remmend it to everyone
i love the amazon paper white kindle i cannotake it anywhere and it is my entire library at my finger tip i can read at night in the glaring sun and even in the nstant change of the outdoor light this is the perfect reader for on the go
kindle is just like a real paper book it also save my book space and easy to organize

i prefered reading actual book over reading digitally because the screen made my eye hurt however the kindle paperwhite is not designed like a regular digital reader it so different i uld read it for hour and my eye wonhurt
this is a great tablet for the price i bought it to replace my ipad mini great for ereading and general browsing
my husband bought this on black friday at a really great price he love how lightweight this is and offer him his email internet functionality and book of urse great buy
bought this to replace a previous tablet that died popped in a gb micro sd card to add memory you need more gb is not much this tablet throw plenty of marketing at you but in exchange you get a lot of functionality for not much money i paid plus tax if you like intense gaming you ll be disappointed i think it not super powerful true it cannot run android apps but it an amazon product so there are lot of apps out there for my light weight need it work well
easy to take on trip hospital or beach clear and sharp display i like that i can add extra space with a stick the price wa right too i would remmend highly
this is perfect for what i needed it for very nice product
we bought two of these for christmas for our girl and they have been great educational apps are easy to find and utilize plus amazon prime access give great selection of movie etc frustrated with too many ad though so i only gave it star
i just wanted something to carry in my purse for not a lot of money this is perfect just jump on wifi and check email or keep up with my book
i have a few issue with this tablet mainly the fact that i cannot get google service on it not even youtube aside from that the biggest downfall is the charging the port is very loose and me undone easily and the charge doe not hold for very long
is very good product and the difiitioin is very good thanks
i m happy with my purchase is all i can say the only mplaint i have is that the mm jack is right next to the volume button and it get in the way
pro great value for moneyenough power to handle lot of android gamesdecent battery lifens feel slow after using for a few weekslow resolution screen and camera

i got this tablet for my grandson a a christmas gift because of the timed parental ntrol feature
i buy these a gift for people everyone love alexa it is fun get one
it is okay i guess but not very user friendly i probably would not remmend to a friend for this reason
this is my rd echo purchase setup is a breeze and alexa is so helpful we use her most often for kitchen timer playing music and weather report highly remmended
we have tried tivo roku and fire fire is the best by far i like the menu and available apps
actually easier to hold than a paperback and might even be lighter
i get frustrated with this alot i like being able to speak mmands but she never seems to know much even though we add skill to her she is always saying she doesnt know that the speaker is not the quality that i would expect for the price
take it out of the box and it is basically ready to assist any question you throw it way lot of fun and a great way for quick information

my uncle love this tablet and it easy for him to use it nsidering his age and lack of knowledge of technology device
doe all the basic stuff i need at a great price i use it for some apps web browsing and some video picked this over the fire for the screen size resolution and cpu gpu battery life is pretty good ad are not too annoying far cheaper than mpeting name brand budget tablet while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported fireos will always be a little behind the current android version and i d rather have google play than amazon but this still allows for side loading stuff remmend if you re ok with living in amazon is world and or proficient enough to load other app store or package or know somebody can
alexa is awesome if you are looking into a smart home this is the only way to go
i got this a a gift for my mom she love it i highly remmend it

absolute junk do not waste your money bought for wife for a christmas gift would not connect to wi fi at my house useless
my wife and i love our kindles because they re great out in the sun on cruise at the beach or when sitting on the uch
best sounding amazon speaker hand down the only annoyance is that it beep after the alexa wake word and after the mmand unlike the other echo i have with no obvious way to turn this off other than that sound great and cannotake with you pretty well anywhere

i am on my rd kindle this software downloads new purchase with a picture of the ver of the book on my homepage only about a fifth of the available space so this would only allow you to buy at most four book at a time before the vers would be too small the new book should be downloaded to my library in list form a in the original kindle in addition once you have looked at a book in the homepage it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category finally this system disallows you from manipulating book the way you want this o is definitely not user friendly it requires a great deal of effort of the user a lot of wasted data space and waste of time i am requesting a return to the original kindle o

my first e reader and i have been filling it up fast great for travel
i bought this tablet with the desire to root and maybe flash a custom rom while you can down grade to a previous version to root with kingroot you can no longer flash custom rom still happy with purchase this is my rd fire

i just love this tap it is so much fun the music is so great i play the relation music every night every night best thing ever
my daughter bought a kindle fire when it st and thought it wa a good deal for something that did so much mine wa only at my local best buy and it is truly a marvel i can watch tv and movie from my library read book and email and order product i cannot imagine any more for any le clear bright lors crisp lettering although small i bought the inch screen
this is a really good tablet for adult but especially great for kid a you can load movie or add apps that they can use the st is so low you just cannot beat it plus the main feature for me wa the amazon kindle name on the product which put it way ahead of the no name tablet on the market great product and gift
this is my third kindle reader and i love it a much a i loved the others light and mfortable to hold especially in bed
love love love my kindle fire this is what my yr old granddaughter said when i bought this for her at christmas we have purchased kindled in the past but this one ha been the best love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it that help so much when you use it for book game music and viedos thanks
it is much lighter than my first gen version and slightly smaller regnizes tap much better and ha a nicer keyboard still ha a few thing i do not like kind of slow insists on me using the silk browser i do not like that i cannot delete certain pre loaded apps that i will never use there are some apps that are not available for it like chromecast for the price it is a good little tablet for internet reading simple game checking email and watchespn battery life still an issue rarely last more than hour with use
you uld not ask for a better value doe everything you ll ever need from a tablet and it is not some cheap knock off brand real deal for under fifty buck cannot beat it
i love my new kindle use it everyday it is easy to use and understand i chose this a tablet
i bought this for my grandma so she uld use it in church to read the bible she love it
what can you say about this amazing product state of the art fun and amazing capability
for the price it is tough to get a better tablet than the kindle fire it is not the same quality a higher priced tablet and you re locked into amazon is esystem but if you re an amazon prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet the kindle fire is a good choice
smooth ui much quicker le laggy than the fire tv stick stream k a well so cannot go wrong
i managed to catch it on sale for and use a mover upon to get it for about after tax tv work great and ha a good picture sound is whatever but it is good enough for me
from web search to kindle book this sleek device doe it all
great asking headline news weather and stock quote play pandora often too wish it would work when unplugged
i bought my echo to explore some new technology when i walk in my house after getting off work i ask alexa to play some music from my play list and there it go alexa keep me up to date on the weather email me recipe play triva game and so much more
the amazon fire is simply amazing i would not buy anything else
if you are nsidering picking up an echo i would also nsider picking some hue lightbulb so you can ntrol your light with your voice i would also suggest using ifttt to get the most out of your echo especially if you have other smart device currently being used in your home uld not be happier with my echo
more memory and better resolution than prior iteration much better for reading book versus a nventional tablet due to fewer distraction easier on the eye
great streaming device and it is a bit faster than the fire stick great buy
great tablet for my three year old son it is really easy for him to use
it wa very easy to use my grandma wa able to figure it out with no problem
the kid use it every chance they get this is the fourth one we have bought
easy to use easy to hold while reading lighter than my first kindell
great product that is nstantly improving with new skill
i like the vered protection it ha and also it me with year replacement so no need to worry it ha fire o so apps wonbe much but there are enough apps for kid
can play almost any song on the spot doe have some trouble with random question but overall it answer most
this is a great product i would highly remmend getting it
so glad i bought the kindle paperwhite i like that it ha a built in light and i can manually adjust it to my liking
caught a black friday sale and wa worth every penny doe all the essential with a great picture for video
this new kindle is smaller than the large one i had it is made for easy reading definitely very happy with this updated version
grandson picked it up used it right away he enjoys the tablet
it a good tablet for being only buck usually people have to buy an expensive tablet for it be good
the amazon fire tv box is probably the best streaming box out there it ha a hardwired ethernet connection if you need it and a fast processor it ha alexa for voice search and it support just about every streaming service out there plus a built in slingbox client most other streamer that support slingbox are actually screencasting from a smartphone or tablet plus it is very easy to sideload application so you can run about anything we have crowded building with a lot of wifi signal stepping on each other so the hardwired connection is good for reliable streaming it ha bluetooth so you can pair device with it i think the remote is actually bluetooth too so you can stash the box out of sight
it is pretty good for the price good for a young teen or someone who doe light web browsing or play light game
being used to an ipad this is difficult to adust to but doe the job just fine for a low price good size to carry around without weighing down your purse would buy again
i used to have the amazon stick which i thought wa good until i got my hand on the amazon tv faster processor le bufferinggreat picture qualityendless choice for programmingif you do not have one go get one you wonregret best buy customer service in signal hill ca star
love it my amazon prime membership keep on giving amazon shopping first amazon tv next now now fire tablet wow free movie and book download and this tablet can handle it at lower price point than hd i wa worried about it screen but you know what it still look good i guess when i look at it side by side with my other galaxy tab i can see the difference but when i just watch this it look great i have been watching hd tv for awhile now so if it is bad i will know this one is still pretty good
great product for kid handy for travel purpose
i checked review and rating for the echo for a long while but wa still hesitant about purchasing it i didnsee the value in this product despite all the good review and rating i wa nvinced to purchase it at best buy when i saw it and it wa out for display my wife and i immediately started to test it it wa nvincing because it wa loud in the store but still the echo wa crisp and loud once we took it home we set it up and it wa even better with all the feature that this me with we use many of them i like how it is built and how much it doe the echo is very helpful and now we are about to buy a uple more for around the house
i bought this to replace an older kindle that broke it ha more feature like front rear facing camera and better resolution screen i feel like it doe not work a well though the screen doe not always respond the internet freeze a lot the lors seem to be a little off all in all still a decent piece for the price
if you already have a paperwhite then there is no need to upgrade but if you are in the market this ha an excellent display and quick page turn the reason to buy a dedicated e reader is the week long battery life love it
this is a great value tablet great screen great apps highly remmend for medium game i ll probably buy another
really ol not using near all the feature so far but hope to add soon
very easy to use and alexa is awesome app store ha anything you uld want in it too
i have been watching the review online and checking with friend that have purchased the echo to see how much they liked or disliked it feature last person i talked to went on and on about all the thing there were using it for and that persuaded me it wa time and best buy had them on sale so it wa the perfect opportunity to go for it amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular mmand center there are so many ol and awesome thing it able to do that i ll hit the highlight that work for our household first we love that it follows your voice in the room the circle lighting will show which direction it is listening the speaker is wonderfully balanced so whether listening to music the news or to alexa speaking i have nothing but high mark for it sound quality given it size next set up after downloading the app to our iphones wa quick easy and very intuitive the more you look over the app the more you will realize a world of skill a amazon refers to them we have nicked named them echolettes lol that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them we have added thing to shopping list while asking about the weather and our calendar of event
if i would have known how wonderful this wa to read with i would not have purchased and ipad i love this to read whenever wherever if you re a reader this is the best ereader
purchased this a a gift for my wife because her b n nook wa dying she absolutely love it especially since it doe so much more i m now waiting for my nook to start acting up so that i have an excuse to get a kindle for myself

echo is a great addition to the home especially since we have wemo product in the house and able to ntrol light throughout the house by simply telling alexa great sound in the kitchen to listen to music with amazon is prime music library
this is a neat device it wa not something i really thought i needed but the family think it is pretty neat
i love my tap it sound great and is so easy to use
great if sharing between kid you can set up a timeframe for each of how long they should be on it
make dumb tv smart very small package slide under flat screen tv remote work everywhere no lost signal fire work better wireless weird voice ntrol is a nice feature but the remote get me there faster
nothing too special or mplicated fill the need
after a lot of research i purchased the fire tv a far asknow it is one of the only if not only streamer out today that after it latest update can force dd to downvert to regular dd over hdmi great feature for soundbar and legacy receiver owner i do not have a k tv so that is not important to me all else work great out of the box this unit had a lot if bug in the beginning but except for lack of vudu i love it being a prime member also help

i really like reading paper white i wish it listed the book the way my kindle fire dose like in a book case but all and all i m very happy with the paper white kindle
the tablet itself wa nice but the screen wa to small for book video and minecraft
seems to work even better and faster than the fire tv stick
small but meaningful software improvement and a screen a good a the voyager make this hand down the best value in the kindle line
i bought several of the amazon tablet a gift and my family and friend were ecstatic i have not given a gift with such great reception in a while
i would totally remmend purchasing amazon fire tv i have enjoyed the simplicity of use and the app i wa wanting plex best buy had the best price for it so i purchased it from there local store
i love my amazon tv box i love that i can plug an ethernet cable directly into it i love that my movie do not buffer and i love alexa she doe so much
it is a great product fast and reliable streaming and service are the best
work great plus look at youtube video is to see other feature available
purchased for my wife she love it and wa amazed at how easy it wa to use after setup doe everything a advertised and more
great price for this tablet my son enjoys this tab
this tablet work great for the price this is my backup tablet for traveling since at the price is easy to replace
this is a great product work with my hue lighting product and ebee thermostat it is fun and the sound reproduction is good nsidering the size of the speaker i would buy the product again if i had the need
bought of these tablet for our household everyone really like the size of this tablet
ha all of the apps you need if you re trying to eliminate cable tv if it had a youtube app it would be perfect
bought this for my wife who love book she wa always agent ebooks but now she cannot be without it
it is fun to talk to alexa from time to time once you teach her some skill she can do a wide variety of thing we love playing music with her and making list for grocery
i ordered this power charger at the same time i ordered my new e reader it work great very fast i wa disappointed that it wa an add on and not included with the price of the reader
very easy to setup and use i would definitely remmend this
i love this thing it get used all the time in our house it is so versatile and ha so many possible connection only thing is be prepared to spend more money on other thing to pair with it
the benefit of having the kindle fire with expandable memory ha been a blessing everyone in my family u the prime benefit and having a kindle for exclusive use is awesome the benefit of adding memory is way better than the newer version with limited memory of or g
bought for my year old and it is perfect she u it to play learning game and even to read kid book on it wa affordable and get is plenty of use
the echo help me keep tract of daily and monthy event hoping later to use it to play music and use it to make the house more efficent
i have to admit i actually like this thing i wish it would browse thing on the internet a little more but oh well
i tried to get this since christmas and it is finally available cannot wait to use it
if you want to cut the cable and go from your cable plan to a much more mmon sense one utilize this magical little box not only can it be loaded up with the standard tv apps it also make a pretty great gaming system
my wife read a ton she u it everyday she is owned others and this is by far the best
love it love it have had several different model like this one the best the kindle fire wa nice but had a hard time reading at night
perfect gift for my dad he love to read he is in love with kindle
i bought this for my aunt she read all the time a she got older she hated carrying multiple book with her everyday and when she traveled this kindle solved all those problem she especially like being able to read magazine periodical and check out library book electronically she love this thing
the amazon fire is by far one of the easiest tablet to navigate through all the apps and with prime membership it is truly a very easy and good sturdy design
easy to use and fast on great for sun or night a
worth the price and pretty useful around the house
my grand daughter ha her educational apps on her tablet and enjoys them tremendously
this is the perfect table to download book from amazon
have no mplaints the paperwhite ha opened up a whole new world for me because my eye do not get tired
fast almost no buffering overall a great product but only mplaint is it is seriously slanted toward amazon prime for instance i have amc through a cable subscription then why do i need to pay again for episode on the amazon amc app so stupid with roku i do not need to pay anything extra for episode i m already entitled to
very mfortable to read from doe not give off a bright light if reading at light doe not strain eye
anyone should be able to run this tablet it really easy to use and good quality for low price
this fire tv is a better choice than the fire stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a lan connection or if you have potential wireless connection it also ha the advantage of expandable storage although i have not found a need for it yet a with the newest apple tv the fire tv u a graphic intensive interface although the fire tv doe not have the apple is volume ntrol selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by apple the only thing keeping this from star is the way amazon chooses to organize the selection all in all the fire tv is the best way to take advantage of your amazon prime membership
having a lot of fun teaching alexa and also learning a lot of new fact
bought this so my brother uld watch his video on something other than my phone
i found the amazon fire tv responds faster than the amazon fire stick plus it ha an ethernet port on my setup this help out a lot since i have fire tv running plex if all of those were on one wifi ap it would probably kill the bandwidth the amazon fire tv load quickly and work a expected the only thing i do not like is i wish i uld customize the home screen so it would only show what i want it to
i have one of the first kindles and had to use a attached light if i read at night this paperwhite is perfect for that a well a the perfect size i absolutely love it
it doe not work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet i would not remmend it
great for reading in bright sunlight or night setting must for avid reader
great tablet especially for the price i bought this to replace an old fire tablet that i had the battery going down it work nicely and i love the kindle freetime and the parental ntrol setting
this tablet is perfect for kid it is inexpensive and durable
very easy to set up even for year old work like a charm alexa start music and check weather for u daily great addition to the home
i wanted to upgrade my rd gen kindle keyboard to one with a backlight the paper white is a great device to read on the backlight and improved screen resolution make a big difference there is a few software feature i d like amazon to add but nothing that inhibits me from using the kindle if you have been thinking of upgrading or jumping into the kindle for the first time i d highly remmend the paper white
you do not need cable service anymore that mean you can save money with this
good picture for video and reading wish amazon would expand app store or use google play
i have to repeat myself when alexa is at volume at a short distance
this wa purchased to have a send echo in the house the first one i have wa placed in the living kitchen area a i use it to play music add note a lot of item to my shopping list and appointment reminder to my calendar i love having a send echo in the bedroom to give me the news brief in the morning give me a status of the traffic and weather nditions play music etc i have noticed a lot of imitation popping up by different mpanies however echo is the best and ha beme an integral part of our house and life it sound dramatic but it is definitely true amazon nstantly update and add new ability feature the ability to link it to light thermostat etc let is me think we are keeping up with the jetsons highly remmend buying an echo
alexa is a practical tool for weather spelling help calendar reminder etc it is also a lot of fun for finding information and playing music
love the ease of alexa easy setu and ha great sound
easy to set up and easy to use my only mplaint is that even with the g scan card it fill up quickly
love this kindle worth the extra little bit to have the backlight very easy to use and worth every penny
is this the best wi fi speaker in this price range no is it the olest absolutely the echo is easily one of the most unique gadget i have in my house right now it is pretty ol a a stand alone speaker but way oler nsidering the smart capability of this device my favorite part about the echo is that a time go on it get better not worse thanks to new skill being developed on a regular basis the only mplaint i would have with this speaker is that at high volume the low end get very distorted
this great product is a mbination of siri and radio it is a hand free device where you can ask anything and play your favorite music station anywhere in the house
this is my send kindle device i enjoy using this to read in lower light nditions with the automatic adjustment touch screen is nice but can accidentally move pagesif your finger slip no issue with readability in many light nditions
tablet wa purchased by our daughter with her own money she worked her tail off for this tablet she love it and will be using for school and travel
i have had my echo for a few week now and it is awesome it is so easy to use the voice mmands there are also a lot of possible connection and add ons in the alexa app great purchase
gift wa appreciated very affordable easy to shop online and pick up at store
my husband love this gift i bought this for christmas
great for kid inexpensive would not mind buying again
great value perfect christmas gift easy to set up and easy to use
nice to have a tablet and kindel in one very easy to use
used the fire sticksbut the upgrade in the box from the stick is amazing would still remmend stick for starter
i wa intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try i also have the bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase for information and requesting a quick song or radio station this thing rock you have to take time letting alexa learn your voice but overall the voice regnition is much better than siri my one mplaint is that it doe not sync with my apple calendar me on amazon cut a deal with apple anyway i give this a thumb up and a star rating get one you wonhave buyer is remorse
my son like the tablet well enough he really only watch video and play game on it
the fire tv wa very simple to setup and give plenty of different viewing option i currently subscribe to netflix and playstation vue both of which i can access on the fire tv i have also downloaded apps for abc hbo showtime nba tv and others to expand my capability certainly worth the price even if you do not subscribe to amazon tv
i love it so much easy to navigate perfect size screen very happy
we have bought many kindle before and they always work put great for u and the kid can use them easily i love that i can set the kid profile so they cannot make purchase i just wish you uld set them to stay in the child is profile until an adult take it out
bought this for my aunt who uld no longer enjoy reading book due to her very poor vision and she love it the only problem she ha is when unwanted window pop up she is not very tech savvy and doe not know how to get rid of them
is a very good box work very good with wifi with movie tv show and a lot more with family tonight
i had used the kindle paperwhite for quite awhile before i got intrigued by the voyage seeing it in person i wa apprehensive about upgrading given the higher st but it wa entirely worth it the paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the voyage feel weightless the screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around little learning curve to the page press on the side but tweaking the setting a little i have it down now
bought it for my kid and they love it they cannot put it down
great
i decided to purchase this tablet because my year old son refused to play with his leap frog tablet he is happy with it and take it everywhere with him including daycare great price
kindles are an excellent device for all book lover
i love amazon tablet that i bought them for my daughter sister sister in law and mother in law awesome product and easy to use
this is a great item great speaker can sync it up to your light etc
very good product wish it did more but hoping it is an evolving thing
this tablet is better than you think you d get for the price decent design and it is faster than most tablet in this price range not a fan of amazon is fire o and wish it had android but most of the apps are available so it is not a major issue overall great buy
great little device to save money stream live and on demand tv great way to save money on tv subscription
although faster than the stick and smart tv apps it still need more on stability and better connection for everyday use mot worth it if it wa more expensive still ok
good tablet for a yr old at first wa not interested and still not but bought in in case and maybe one day if they decided to use it on a road trip good product for the price
gave this a a gift grandson love it we liked the low price
easy to use easy download game kid love to do school work on tablet
the kindle is everything i expected it to be and fit all the need that i had of this item
set up direction uld have been more detailed work fine with sirius xm
extremely easy to setup good screen quality good battery life extremely pleased
these are great tablet for the kid and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft yet bulky a good thing in this instance case the only thing i wish wa that it uld access the google play store so my kid uld watch the movie we have in our google play movie acunt
when amazon first released this i uld not rationalize spending the money to purchase something that uld play music answer question report traffic and weather etc i did a lot of research before looking into purchasing one because i wanted to start nverting my home into a smart home i purchased this along with the philip hue and so far i have not regretted the purchase using the apps to ntrol the lighting is great but when you can simply use voice mmands it make it that much more nvenient i would remmend this or any of the other echo product if you re looking to nvert to a smart home
hard to use and doe not support guam online instruction not clear
i got this on black friday for my mother and so far she enjoys it it wa to replace her ipad mini that they have basically designed to beme in operable within year she can add storage to the kindle the picture is fire and she can read a plethora of book that suit her fancy it is nice size and responsive
i reviewed a lot of tablet before i bought this one it is the first one i have ever purchased i am no tech geek and it wa pretty easy to figure out how to use it i mostly bought it for and use it for reading e mail facebook and browsing the internet i really like it and use it more than my laptop but if i need to do anything detailed i use my laptop overall it is a great tablet for a beginner and you cannot beat the price
i find the alexa educational fun entertaining and nvenient i say nvenient because i love that i can ask the time without looking elsewhere whether it is the middle of the night or while getting ready for work there are so many type of question alexa can answer
the screen is adequate and the service is reliable i did not play with it much due to it being a gift sadly the person it wa purchased for wa unable to hold onto it long enough to use it elderly lady i still have it though and it is a great little backup to my primary tablet
for the price is great for kid i like that memory expansion can go up to gb
the downside is everytime i open up the tablet there is an advertisement i would prefer not to see these font is changeable brightness is adjustable
out of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the usb drive and you re ready to go you get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive a a back up if you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it if you say decide later it will me up each time you plug it in to the usb drive
great product for my seven year old granddaughter
great gift idea and reasonably priced love the alexa feature
lot of fun and entertaining bought this for my parent to keep them active in the technology world and they love it great purchase that work great for them especially when they tell it to ntrol the lighting i setup in their home
our granddaughter love to read and my wife ha one also so we thought this would be a perfect gift for her

i saw this item on amazon if i had ordered it from them i would had to wait day best buy had it in stock for the same price having u it for several week i found it a great small tablet for a great price i plan to buy several more a stocking stuffer for an entry level tablet you cannot beat it
right out of the box this will be a family hit for all
i m pretty impressed especially with the price tag being buck
i loved the price for this tablet good value for what my son u it for
this tablet wa great i bought it for my sister on christmas and she love it it is great for surfing the web and watching video
i upgraded from the kindle touch so i uld have a built in light the light is fantastic while it took some getting used to the press button for page turning on the side i love that too can use it with one hand and do not have to take hand off to touch the screen the documentation uld use some work a diagram with what all those in are that they refer to would be a big help took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what i wanted one thing i hate the new bookmark method the old rner fold wa easier and le intrusive still can figure out how to delete from my clipping also i wish amazon would me out with a case similar to an otter box i do not want leather or auto turn on which seems to be problematic on nearly every case i look at
best buy and it is employee in the granville wv store made my christmas thank you so much i had ordered my product on line from amazon and ups lost my package never heard anything else from ups when they said they would have the driver pick back up from where they dropped it wrong and bring it to me amazon did refund my money but they were out of the product to reorder best buy had my product and had it waiting for me when i got to the store this wa a christmas present for my granddaughter thank you so much for having this is stock and getting it to me in le than one hour yay for best buy i also bought a lap top a few month ago from the same store then today i bought a few other item so happy with your product and especially your customer service
overall am very happy with the purchase both quality and price made this hard to resist
i bought this a a birthday gift for my brother it took him a minute to get used to it because he previously used an ipad however with the help of youtube he quickly got it up and running and ha been enjoying it
i have never used this product before found it to be very easy

bought this a a gift for my yr old he love it uld not tear him away from it even when the battery die wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distance so i attempted to add him to my phone plan the only problem is the device doe not have the option to add a sim card so my attempt wa futile it really draining on my phone battery life and data to keep tethering soon will be looking in to another tablet ipad option that allows for the usage of a sim card some way or another when wifi is not available
we bought this for our and year old the kid love it and it is simple to use the kid profile make it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use we can switch to our profile to watch netflix or use other apps if we want me with a great warranty and device protector we re very happy with the amazon fire tablet

i bought for my daughter to keep her busy and it work great
out at the farm we set up a clearstream antenna and got about twice a many channel that we wanted to watch total about we needed an interface for streaming and this work great in addition it give u a remote ntrol for our tablo to rerd the show with no subscription needed total rd cutting
the tablet is great for only but certainly not the most touch responsive it feel a little slow to me it also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ad from the lock screen
mpared to roku provides more flexibility for those who like to use these unit beyond standard i do not give star because the interface is okay but i much prefer plex is looking view i wa going insane with my slow samsung smart hub tv on my send tv purchasing this wa a good decision overall i remmend these unit
this item is the worst ever a d the tech support is even worst spent hour troubleshooting and their solution wa to return it to bestbuy a d get anotherone so i did and guess what it didnwork ether basically the netflix app cannot be downloaded becuse the amazon fire tv wonlet you and to make it worst if you re a fan of hbo brace yourself becuase the app is not even available on their app store hbo simply doe not exist i spent in total day troubleshooting with the amazon team actually managing the fire tv remotely from their office and the answer wa that ether the equipment is defective or that they do not have netflix or hbo available for it really it freaking advertised on the box dont waist your money better get an apple tv or a roku
this deal it very nvenient for little one all in one set
bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely love it i also use it for school which work great with writing note directly on powerpoints
this product is great for all movie and show geek
this space is getting more crowded all the time but amazon wa first out of the gate and also give it the most attention echo ha gotten smarter and better almost every week and i m excited to see what me next sound quality out of this unit is also amazing no need for extra speaker like with the dot this is an all in one unit add spotify or a free iheartradio acunt and if you have amazon prime you ll be amazed at how many song this little device can play i use it every day to ntrol light set timer alarm and more echo ha beme a device that i now cannot live without which i initially thought wa just a toy it is now my favorite kitchen appliance
this system work great even my five year old son can navigate channel with the remote or voice ntrol ha parental ntrols for purchase and viewing subscription required for some viewing
this item is a budget friendly gift for reader and internet browser

most tablet i have tried really stink but this one is ok wish it had google though
it work just fine
my grandson broke his amazon fire table one day after warranty expired he wa disappointed so i bought him an version he had a big smile
this inch tablet exceeded my expectation and then some i wa apprehensive about having advertising on the wake up screen but with a simple swipe of the thumb it go away with no waiting it stream netflix and uv pie from flixster with zero lag and no buffering expandable memory micro sd this is basically an android tablet so if you have experience using that platform you will have no trouble navigating the setting menu etc there is no google play store access however the amazon app store is available and is pretty impressive the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear one of my mplaints with my old tablet wa the visibilty when viewing at an angle but this tablet doe not have the same issue all in all this tablet is the best value i have seen a it outperforms the dual re tablet i just replaced if you are looking for a inch tablet you can not go wrong with this one
this is a great little tablet especially for the price
i like this product alexa is a good listener and provides me the information instantly it is always a joy and funny when you ask a out of the world question and get a pretty accurate response

great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best
nice product for the price it doe what we need it to do easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop
found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing me with it it is a listening device in my home that wondo anything unless i pay more into amazon the fact that i synced my pandora acunt is pointless because i have to spell out what i want alexa to play by saying alexa play x station from my pandora play list how is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when i am the only one who know my pandora play list and barely at that i have many mplaints and basically disappointed in my purchase i wa lead to believe this wa the radio of the future it is if i pay for the amazon music unlimited monthly
even after reading the review about it being slow i decided to go head any purchase it didnthick it wa going to be this slow
i bought this tablet for my year old and love it great parental ntrol set up goal for the day turn off at the time i decided work perfectly and very fast processor

we enjoy this device because it allows out tv to have smart tv feature

this is a nice tablet it ha a really good clear screen
work perfectly is quick and fun to use music sound great
the tablet work nice for reading and surfing the internet it also ha decent choice of game to download from amazon it also play video decent but the resolution on the screen on the screen is a little lacking it is not an ipad air but a a basic tablet it function well for the price
my husband prefers the paperwhite model over the voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat finger since it ha a larger frame so more room for the finger and kindle paperwhite and voyager model are much easier to read for long hour than tablet easier on the eye i have an ipad and still have a kindle for reading i highly remmend the kindle paperwhite and voyager model
i use this and my apple tv the amazon fire box is great you can watch your favorite show through them and hulu and netflix what make the fire stand out is that you can add apps you cannot find in their app store kodi make cutting the rd so easy
do not let the low price and screen size fool you this tablet is a bargain at and work flawlessly it ha long battery life and a bright display i find myself using it most often to view movie on amazon prime which can be flung to my flat screen tv instantly this is a must have item for
this is a very good tablet for the price about regular price good image quality and battery life have been a prime member for several year so the included medium access video audio and book is great it is not an android tablet so much of the google esystem is not available the amazon appstore ha lot of option but not nearly a many a the google play store would remmend adding a microsd storage card also would get better file manager and video playback apps there are several good free option from amazon is appstore
i purchased this and the dot for use with my elderly parent both have poor eyesight and this voice driven product ha enriched their life set up an amazon alexa product for them and enrich their life alarm clock timer weather news music are just some of the thing that can help them

i like being able to ask a question without having to pull out my phone tablet or mputer and also listening to music

love this little device a it run better than other box it is a simple machine that ha great capability
work great for a tablet and inexpensive i got three in the past year and they all work great i got them a gift but i believe they do not have the same apps you can get through apple and google play you may want to check that out if you are using it for those apps

even better than the echo dot it ha a fantastic speaker
alexa regnizes most mmands and question and will tell you when she doe not seems like she learns daily we have the remote ntrol too and it is very helpfull when alexa is not in the room that we are in set up is easy and music sound great shopping list and to do list are awesome and they appear on your smart phone via the alexa app timer and alarm are useful too right now my mplaint is alexa cannot answer your paired smart phone yet i read amazon is working on this
buck and it is still a good tablet i have issue with it cause i have always used the ipad so it is a mpletely different experience i just wanted something to watch movie while i rode the train and this is perfect the biggest flaw is the ad everytime you turn it on but make up with the capability of adding storage look buck for a good tablet is cheaper than a night out with friend
the only issue with this is that you will need to create an acunt for the child or you will have to add them onto your acunt for amazon
this is a great tablet for it price and it ha many u
i love this amazon fire tv box and best buy had the lowest price and they have the best customer service
amazon fire tv is on fire this is the best stream device now in day i will highly remmended the speed is amazing all you need is a good internet service to enjoy it is maximum potential and if you have a prime acunt in amazon you get to enjoy many movie and tv series get this device for your home

i got this gift for the wife for a starter tablet and she love it
i love this item because my three child can use it age to the screen is fenomenal
have had this fine unit now for about six week having previously owned three other ereaders over the decade so far it is exceptional from the others for the following reason battery life text clarity back lighting to read in limited light circumstance price on sale for ease of highlighting and saving such highlight to a note document light weightbelieve this reader is not able to withstand harsh handling and would remmend a sturdy ver and the care one might give something fragile a well a having importance to oneself
bought the fire box for main television in house and it work great
we love this echo the speaker is very good both volume and sound wise we can hear the music throughout the house it wa easy to set up and is easy to use no mplaints here

this is my rd kindle purchase i do also have an ipad and a samsung tablet but for reading that doe not strain your eye long battery life and soft backlight that can be adjusted from bright daylight to low light dark room setting that doe not bother a sleeping husband this is definitely the best if you are an avid reader then i especially remmend a the storage is also ample enough for hundred of book and you still have all your kindle book purchased from amazon in the cloud to free up space if needed
the kindle is great for taking on a plane trip or just having something to read while you re waiting in the doctor is office and there is a great selection of book online
i m an apple fan boy between my wife daughter and me we have two mini mackbook air a pro ipads and two iphones and an apple watch we also have apple tvsi retired my living room apple tv after finding out all the ol stuff you can do with the fire stick this is a must for anyone with a prime acunt since apple tv doe not allow amazon yet heard the app will be there soon the best part is modding it with fire tv guru

my daughter had her kindle fire hd stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the thanksgiving holiday it wa a no brainier to purchase it since it wa cheaper than the fire we purchased a year ago granted the fire hd ha a much crispier screen but for my year old daughter she is now happy just to have a tablet again and it can do all the thing she need it to do read book play game skype etc
there are a few option in this area amazon ha more time and experience in the field and in some way it show it doe not do everything yet but is growing all the time surprisingly good speaker and alexa is quite good with voice regnition

way faster than the fire stick i hook up to my garage tv to watch live boxing from the showtime app plus many more apps have prime subscription but not necessary in my opinion

this amazon fire tv is my send unit in my home i have not paid for cable since i bought my first unit a uple year ago if you are an amazon prime member you should seriously already own one

alex is a wonderful device and so much fun to use i cannot wait for the more product to catch up
the device is one of the best especially if you are an amazon prime subscriber the amazon prime music on the firetv is the best music streaming device the only issue i had is that the remote ntroler stopped working and i had to use the firetv app on my phone to ntrol the device
very handy to know news weather traffic and google without opening laptop
it is a great item to have when you are out and about it is easy to connect to wi fi and it is small enough to fit in my purse

not many apps the first one wa already returned no power issue after week i hope the send one is fine
get your weather forecast first thing in the morning review your to do list check your appointment for the day all while having your morning ffee great way to start your day
the kindle wa a a replacement for an earlier model it performance and ease of use are superb however the battery life is far shorter than my older version it would not last from la to frankfort and the old one did
this device is for me the best streaming device out there
alexa function until yopu attempt to connect to multiple device then technical suppprt is worthless
no connection to wifi nook lor hd work on it

great product for beginner and senior citizen simple to operate
my send kindle and i wa really glad to see that i didnlose all my photo and book
love that the tap is portable drag it all around the house and outside i m not an audiophile but i think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level only wish it wa always listening when it is charging on the dock
i love my new fire the only problem i have is putting it down when it is time to go to bed
the alexa assistant is more accurate than siri a well a very responsive

easy set up ton of music easy to use if you are looking for voice activated this is not it
very useful and fun to use i bought for the beach house

i love this product it very great for my son my son educational apps on here
absolutely love my kindle fire would buy for friend and family it is the perfect mbination of a tablet and e reader
i bought the tap to integrate with the echo it is ideal for my husband office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact alexa the wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect
my son love this we have had two other tablet both st about the same a this the others were pretty unusable this table is fantastic definitely great value for the money
a friend gave me a dot which i enjoyed i decided to explore the other device i wa torn between the echo and the tap after reading a cnet review i chose the tap because it is portable my two frustration are you cannot change the wake up word alexis and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service if you are amazon prime or audible book member it is a great addition to you household
it took me a bit to warm up to it going from a tablet to this little but it is rapidly beming my go to the video quality is great and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet i love the nvenience of having a smaller tablet my only wish is that the battery life wa a bit longer than the hour that said in sleep mode it last day very happy and will be purchasing a larger fire tablet in the future
inexpensive no need to worry about it getting broken lost
ordered online quick delivery and easy set up work great
i read the review before i purchased this item and so far so good the handy dandy case that i found on sale for at the same time work well too
this wa a christmas gift for my nephew he really enjoy playing game a watching video it a cheap and good alternative to the i pad
still learning how to use would love to get local channel
this product is amazingly faster than the firestick and would remmend this over the stick any day of the week
i really love this product i have down loaded many many book and i like it because it is big when i brought mine my sister returned and purchased her one too
best streaming device on the market today amazon is a good mpany
i have always been an avid paper book reader never thought i uld nvert purchased the kindle at best buy and i am totally hooked love the nvenience a well a simp e access to book inexpensive on line
i bought this kindle paperwhite for my son to use at school instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet the display option make it adaptable for just about anyone and is much easier on the eye when reading for an extended period of time please keep in mind that this doe not have a glowlight the kindle is durable and although i bought a case for it a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it the most surprising thing about this ha been the extra long battery life my son is an avid reader and noticed that he need to charge his kindle nsiderably le than when he u his tablet
i like alexa in white better than the black version but it depends on your furniture
excellent tablet love the size fit perfectly in my purse i would remmend this tablet
tablet is a great size to hold and allow child to play game on such a abc mouse and even got pokemon go to work on it after some fiddling only mplaint is how much need to be on the system storage even when having a large sd card so that limit how much you can have
mpletely satisfied work a it should
alexa is extreme y polite and helpful just love asking for particular song and instantly hearing them play with a crisp sound great device
perfect tablet for the price doe everything incredibly well snappy performance thinking about getting a send one expandable memory is a massive plus

i bought this for my mom so she uld play her game and do facebook she wa having a hard time seeing them on her phone she absolutely love her tablet she carry it everywhere a great purchase i would buy it again and again for her joy well worth the money a big hooray to amazon and best buy
i love this tablet and use it a an ereader mainly i love how this is capable of reading my book to me if they re mpatible my favorite feature for sure thay way i can listen while i m cleaning the house and my kid love to listen to them too it bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem tactically the screen is so nice i love the feel the internet browser is a but clunky so if thats your main desire this may not be the best i feel it doe well for my need i have found most apps to suit my need on the amazon app store
i bought of these tablet a gift for my nephew age and they absolutely love them
bought this for my yo daughter for christmas and it is a sturdy little unit it survived fall and drop but the one weak spot is the usb power plug somehow my daughter managed to break it however this is where amazon stepped up a the tablet is warranty call for amazon to replace if damaged i called customer service they took my info and i had a brand new tablet deliver the next day
gave this a a christmas gift to my uncle because he ha been given other tablet that did perform a they advertised i have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the fire and his answer ha always been yes i also purchased one for myself a well and it ha ntinued to perform a well a it did on the first day i started it up it is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology i would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a send thought
this is one of the olest and neatest tech toy out there it ha a reasonable price and offer many many option in term of use it can pair with your light and many other tech toy to be all verbally ntrolled it is a great source for simple thing even such a weather and news have an amazon prime acunt and feel free to unleash the music a the speaker in alexa is pretty beast and can handle some serious tune worth the money if you like tech both small and big
how do you rate a charger something you need but do not really want it work so it is okay
first time user had no problem getting started must have internet connection and know name and password for wi fi
reading a book it is great working with pdf file not so great also please be aware that amazon customer service will treat you like a pariah because you purchased this kindle from best buy instead of directly through their store
bought this for a xmas present but heard it play when a good friend bought it wa very impressed with it is technology i remmended it to another friend and she bought it for her daughter
bought this for grandson because it wa cheaper than a kid tablet bought a case and it work fine

an excellent product easy on the eye when reading lot of apps and access to a wide variety of book catalog magazine and news outlet i would highly remmend it
i find the kindle paperwhite to be much easier on the eye then reading from a tablet page turning is a bit slower than on the tablet but the headache are le
i thoroughly enjoy this table easy to operate plenty of memory and i can use it for anything that i typically use a mputer for
it ha a lot of potential that i have not tapped into yet but it is met my expectation so far
alexa is a wonderful addition to the technology in the home ask alexa and you shall receive an answer from weather to sport sres you will get the sop
i have not gotten all of the skill alexa can do but it is a good product that play my music well

i have enjoyed a kindle reader for year if you think your phone work just a well you probably have never tried a kindle reader when my last one began to fade i hit the review and then bought this one i would rather pay a bit more and have all the feature that i want than go for the best value for money to save a few buck and have buyer is regret in this case they are both the same

i love this tablet it is easy to use and set up i love reading book and magazine on the tablet the apps are great and easy to use this is an all around great device
great product and work flawlessly with home automation at first i wa a huge skeptic about needing an always on device however after buying an echo earlier this year from amazon i have beme an avid user so much so that i bought a send one from best buy once they began carrying them also per ordered their amazon dot which is order one now you will not be disappointed
many of my friend raved about how well the fite tv performed and after month of hearing great thing about it i have to say this ha been one of the best investment
we truly enjoy our fire tv it give u a wide range of viewing from tv show to movie
i have other kind of table this the best i have had i can listen to music read a book listen to a book or watch movie tv show
it is good tablet for any age love it very easy to use

i have wanted an inexpensive tablet for awhile and my wife surprised me with this kindle for my birthday it is perfect for my need
bought this for my wife and she love it no problem reading on the beach
this ha all i need and want great storage and speed
purchase the echo with my vivint system because sale person pushed the product stating it would enhance the vivint capability not really so it is a nice gadget for music and putting together shopping list and to do list but not really something we needed in addition not enough apps that work with it
i have never had a tablet before everything wa easy to figure out battery last a long time
good product
love my amazon fire easy to hook up and use even better if you are an amazon prime member music movie netflix hulu many more
i absolutely love this little device i grabbed the audio adapter for it and use it nstantly it work well to say the least
i absolutely love my amazon echo highly remmend
i got this a an upgrade for my old kindle i love the new feature crisp clear picture easy to find app location tab well organized they added blue shade to adjust the lor of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep when reading it learns your pace give you an estimate on when you will finish the book which i think is neat can watch netflix hulu all around great product in my opinion
i purchased this item for a very special woman for christmas she is exceptionally happy that is great for me
the echo is very entertaining and informative it is an excellent speaker too
i loved the kindle but it took one small fall about foot and half of the lcd screen broke it is ruined i knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor
bought this a an upgrade for my yr old son from his nabi and he love it
this item ha worked well and is a great addition to our home very easy to get information i also hope to align it with some smart home functionality soon
everything seems to work a intended the available storage is small when you include the pre loaded apps i should have known that would be the case
great on the go mpanion for avid reader easy to load book and connect with prime
it ol speak what you want and with amazon prime can just place order by talking

love this great screen easy to read in different lighting and long battery life the amazon website ha far more review for book and book are sometimes cheaper highly remmend
movie were great would remmend to all my friend and family
what i really like about the kindle paperwhite is being able to read in full sunlight ambient light and also the sole dedication to reading i m not tempted in the middle of a book to jump over to twitter facebook etc
this is not my first kindle i wanted one i uld read outdoors and it is exactly that small but not too small it fit easily into your hand and it easy to transport i am satisfied
really crisp picture fast and good amout of storage
i uld not pa up this deal of the day a tablet for under the fire is a great basic tablet i wish the sound wa better but that can be addressed via a bluetooth speaker
i recently bought it and it wa my first kindle previously seen the lor version kindle fire mparing the kindle paper white v other tablet i like that you can read ebook only so there is no distraction usually when i grab an ipad or any smart tablet the least i do is read since there so many other thing you can do the kindle paper white will put you to read the minute you grab it leaving the last page you left off on your ebook it is lightvery clear easy on your eye back light for night use adjustable brightness mparing all the model this one wa the best pick for the money
i bought this a a gift for my mom and she love it
previously used kindle app on phone and tablet to read kindle book but the readability on the kindle itself is much better le strain on eye and more natural to read for extended time plus the light weight and easy handle ability is great
perfect gift for my mom who wa homebound after surgery made the time go by so much faster
bought fire tablet so my boy would not be starng at their iphones for game they were thrilled
a birthday gift for my son and he like it always attached to his hand and always on it
i love my new paper white kindle i have had it a little over a month now i have had other kindles before including the kindle fire but this new paper white one is the best i have had so far i love the ability to read it outside no matter how sunny it is there is absolutely no glare this kindle is super light weight i carry it in my purse all of the time this kindle also ha an amazing back light so i can read when it is is dark out definitely worth star
easy setup fun to use very helpful i bought this for my in law and they love be it alexa help keep up with doctor appt grocery list and other important thing
i purchased it for my nieceshe love it and allows her to stream program and play many game
this tablet is a great price perfect for those who use amazon and want to use amazon apps do not let the low price and screen size fool you work flawlessly it ha long battery life and a bright display this is a must have item for
this is the best and probably only e reader that you need screen is beautiful and perfect with built in light however i would like one with bigger screen size and hope amazon uld improve reading performance on pdf file
one thing i like most about the kindle fire product line are the extensive parental ntrols the game play seems to be good and movie playback is a well my kid love theirs
best tablet for the money amazon delivers a good product
got one for myself and one for my son like the parental setting available no more inappropriate youtube video fast great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night
at first i wa super impressed but there are time when alexa ha voice regnition issue overall not a really big deal so i would purchase again
i bought this one for myself it work fine it is fantastic
this amazon tap is awesome take alexa outside the sound quality is amazing and the price is right
wa unable to get to google doc on this one even though the sale person said we would be able to my granddaughter needed this for school it did not allow you to get to google doc
gave out to kid for gift the kid love them will see how they hold up they are not ipads but for the price they are well worth it right now
great tablet for the price however the ad upon the lock screen is irritating
great tablet for kid but a lot of ad for someone who want a cheap tablet that more or le can do all stuff this is a good choice
great tablet for a very small price would buy again
purchased for kid it is easy for them to use it they love the apps great parental ntrols
i love this thing and bring it with me everywhere my only problem is the backlight hear me out i suggest this if your a serious reader the problem is that reading a glowing page is off putting and one of the reason i bought a paper white becuase i cannot read on a ipad for but maybe min but it not that bad i usually just turn it off becuase most of my reading is done in daylight all in all great but not perfect and if your into occult read like i am be ready to fork out the for them the selection doe leave some to be desired but not bad i give the kindle store for book a out of if your not a serious reader book a week imo i i would go with a voyage or if you can stick to the ipad i would do that
it is a great tablet for it price i would remmend
i got this tablet for my niece because while she wa visiting with me her tablet that she brought with her stopped working i got online and searched for an inexpensive tablet that would do the same thing that her non working tablet would do and so i searched and ran upon this tablet and this is it plus more
really enjoys it and all the different option you can use it for
got this tablet for my mother and liked it so much that i went and got one for myself it run fast for what i use it for
the best in the market a far a e reader go the text is sharp with the new screen the backlight are useful for reading at night without light on integration with the kindle store make it very easy to instantly purchase and read the book i have one small build quailty issue with the unit that i have the left side of the kindle creak when i squeeze on it exchanged for a new unit but problem still persists although not a bad
everyone one in my house love the amazon echo cannot wait to see what new skill will be added in the day and year ahead alexa is a whole lotta fun
the only thing i have to remmend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that
i personally have of these in my home and we love them i love the fact that i can set restriction for my kid great product
definitely an excellent kindle for the price cant beat it
i bought my wife a paperwhite a uple of year ago while i did much of my reading on my ipad she loved the paperwhite and i didnknow what i wa missing out on do not get me wrong i love my ipad it is just that it wa not designed to be only a reader now that i have a paperwhite of my own reading ha beme even more enjoyable than it wa on my ipad and i cannot think of one negative thing to say about my purchase
this product work the same a the firestick but is suppose to have k and better quality to be honest it look the same on our inch k tv this product doe not me with the rds to hook it up so you need to buy an hdmi rd and an ethernet rd which add to the st but i do love the amazon product mpared to other device

great price for a little powerhouse tough tablet this wa given to my nephew year old and he is like a bull in a china shop but this little tablet ha held up it may not be the fastest or the best screen but for small child or accident prone adult this is a great tablet it doe a lot and amazon ntrols for the younger set is quite powerful

i have it integrated with the philip hue and it only work about half of the time the app is pretty weak and really painful to try and play audible book from that said i m getting another one for upstairs because it is insanely handy to be able to add item to shopping list todo list and do timer from anywhere in the house
love my kindle i enjoy reading everyday and i can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight
i had an old non backlit kindle and loved it when this one went on sale i bought one for my son an avid reader like me and he liked it so much i bought one for my wife next time it went on sale i wa going to get one for myself but the sale ended i forgot about it just kept using my old kindle then lo and behold it went on sale again so i ran out and finally got one for myself keep in mind my primary use of it is a an e reader and for that i cannot imagine a better device i can also pop online and check my email etc but i only do that when i m on a secure wifi e g at home or a friend i do not use hotel etc even if there is a password because shared wifi is are insecure so for it cannot be beat
space saving device and energy saver feel like a king mmanding for information and ease of use my music stream well and quality of sound is great verage over square foot perimeter must buy product

we bought it just for fun but now we cannot live without it we have and use them everyday trust me buy and alexa you ll love it
my kid love that they can ask her any question and she answer it
it is not blazing fast but fine for streaming music to a bluetooth device hey for at bb i m not mplaining amazon appstore somewhat limited but you can download android apk apps like firefox opera browser etc that work fine silk browser can be speeded up a bit with setting adjustment buy a class micro sd card they re soo cheap now because you only get gb onboard and will get used up real fast wireless not dual band so forget g but doe have decent range people say screen resolution not fantastic but i have watched many a network show with tw cable app and hd is pretty decent
the fire tablet is great especially for the price and if you are an amazon prime member it is even better you can read book for free using amazon is lending library and watch prime video for free too you can even get google play store and download apps just google it on the fire make sure you get a micro sd card right away because the gb internal storage fill up very quickly
stream great i love using alexa to play almost any song i cannothink of and the interface from the remote is very easy and reliable

this kindle paperwhite is exactly what i wa looking for to read outdoors and the backlight is great to read at night
i purchased this because have beme a rd cutter and this wa highly remmended by a good friend a a worthy streaming box i wa pleasantly how fast and responsive it is and future proof with the added k functionality only downside is that it ha a tremendous amount of amazon bloatware which i understand but it is nstantly present
wa looking for an inexpensive tablet for our child got this while on sale and ordered a screen protector and child case ha worked well can set daily limit to prevent them from using to much would buy again
the fire tv box stream really well and might just be better than my roku
i bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one not much storage and the rd strip easily
i had a first gen paperwhite and wa not sure if the upgrade would be worth it but it really is a nice step up software is pretty much the same obviously but the screen is a real step up and is not that why you get a kindle over a tablet
my son love his own kindle very kid friendly and easy for him to use it is great that he now ha his own
i bought one for myself and really liked it bought this one for wife so far shes pleased perfect size for purse and portability
i have a lot of fun talking to alexa i have ordered a few thing from amazon thru alexa which can be hard for her to understand what your ordering but she is still learning
all i can say a soon a i opened this tablet it never ever turned on i wa so upset a i have followed the troubleshooting step from other user online and still it never worked i fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on i had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them they never believed me this item came to be defective after storming out and after a while they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for it i would never buy an amazon product ever again piece of junk bad quality product thanks

i like the large display it is very readable for this old man is eye the lors are vibrant and crisp it play video well i love the amazon underground absolutely free apps and game the only drawback for me is the amazon modified android o i m slowly figuring it out the camera leave a lot to be desired although they are not the reason i bought this it is a bit heavy for me but with a folio it is easier to hold i also bought the tempered glass screen protector
awesome product not a tech savvy person easy to use from setup to uploading and watching my pick of movie not disappointed in the lease saved me money on my cable bill too
alexa is a useful tool to have around the house and she help u with simple task and need
this is a very good tablet for the price especially for amazon prime member the display is very sharp and so far the battery life is excellent

the amazon fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kid i set parental ntrols to prevent internet access my only issue is that the amazon app store doe not offer the youtube kid app other than that he is had the the tablet for about mths we have had no issue

my granddaughter love this tablet it is the perfect gift for a year old
i really love the amazon echo one of it is great hidden feature is that it can read any of your kindle book to you i plan on using it with my tv once i purchase the harmony device by logitech
easy and enjoyable to use had the original and wa not sure i d like the change but i do
love the apps and set up done by the geek squad and the simple step to set up
amazon fire hd is one of the best deal at strong efficient low price and some amazon feature that i love youtube video of how to get googleplay and android apps have made thing lot more easier and now microsoft office is available online for free that i can access and edit my document what else do i need amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brand or used old model of high price brand definitely remmend it
i received the echo from my husband for mother is day it is very helpful to me nice to know the weather before i get dressed in the morning
this is my first piece of streaming equipment and it wa simple to set up and use the remote ntrol is nvenient and it ha voice ntrol this apparatus make streaming movie from amazon prime super easy
i purchased this for my wife so that she ha an option other than her phone or laptop to browse the internet
this is the rd kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version the light on this one is a really nice feature the battery life is better the page turning option are better it is lighter there are just a lot of nice little improvement if you like to read in an electronic format i cannot imagine disliking the kindle
the amazon fire tv work better and faster than the fire stick every aspect of this is better watching every show or movie start up fast and is much clearer
excellent value for the money can not go wrong for the price
when i purchased the tap i thought it wa a portable speaker for the echo it is actually it is own device yes it is portable can operate wireless it doe work with the same alexa set up the echo operates with no handsyou can simply speak to alexa the tap ha a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to alexa great sound quality rechargeable base unit
purchased these for my grandkids and they absolutely love them they can play play their game to their heart ntent they ar ed really fast too
great tablet for a little kid i wa debating between this and an ipad but figured an ipad would be way too much for a tablet it nice because you can switch user if you want something simple then this is the one for you
it is worth it for the shopping and todo list alone great product
love this tablet bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub but use it for so much more now
i have had the fire tv stick for year now and this far outperforms the old fire tv stick the ability to wire the device is a nice addition
great product love all the thing you can do with the echo music game weather sport nversions etc
i would be happy to give it a christmas gift to many of the people i know i love the size of the screen a charge last and the bluetooth sink well with the wireless keyboard it is almost a good a i ipad
nothing like turning on your music checking the local weather and traffic getting world information and ntrolling the light around your home all hand free i purchased this for my wife for mother is day and i use it myself all the time this is a must have
been reading review for month i decided to take a chance when i saw this on sale for off and i am glad i did i love to read and reading is easy and relaxing i dont have to worry about losing my place and amazon always offer up the next book in the series so i can ntinue reading with very little interruption i know that some have mplained about missing pixel on the screen mine wa just fine maybe they have nquered the pixel problem highly remmended
i love my kindle the paperwhite is great for reading outside because you do not get a reflection back like you do with other type of kindles the white lor is a nice change
one of the best electronic device i have ever purchased just a few thing i wish it would do better like sync with apple device better
i love to read on this new voyage i take it everywhere with me bought a cute book ver for it also i would remmend this to anyone who love to read doe not want to lug around heavy book x x
purchased for grandchild and they love it they are five year old
nice
i enjoy this product and highly remmended you can not go wrong in purchasing this alexa it play my smooth jazz while working in my office
i purchased another amazon fire this year for my other grandson for christmas it is a very good buy for a child is first tablet it doe not have a lot of memory but can be expanded the amazon fire allows for game movie and digital book to be used the price is awesome for the value
this is my send kindle the first one stopped holding a charge i do not know if that is a problem with the kindle or not but i still love my kindle
this is my third kindle fire it work beautifully the only problem i have is little detail that are different from previous model i m getting used to it a i go i m learning
really enjoyed this like the hard wire instead of wi fi great apps very easy to understand
the price is outstanding it work great for my use surfing the web little slow and the image is not super sharp but you cannot beat the price if you re looking for an inexpensive tablet this one is great
this is a great little tablet for what you re paying for it get everything done that i need it to
we had gotten some of the other kindle fire tablet and they were all great to use this one is no exception
overall good tablet for kid my and year old both enjoy it battery doe not last anywhere near hour though
i will never pay for tv programming ever again i love my fire stick
what is great about the fire tv is it is great interface and frankly it is affordability if you want k streaming a fast fluid interface then this is what you want the nvidia shield is great and yeah it is powerful and play game but for the price and if you just want to stream it is not worth it the selection of android game is so limited do not waste your money i have also been turned off by the roku interface it seems too kiddish and just not a intuitive i am using these fire tv device through out the house to stream live tv and my movie llection through an app called emby it is a fantastic experience for the whole family and save me a bundle on rental fee from the cable mpany and electricity due to it is low power nsumption if you want just want to stream and play your home movie llection this is what you want
this little box pack quite a powerful punch stream all your movie and show especially great with prime membership
i bought this case for my son fit perfectly easy to put on love it
i have an echo tap and a dot currently my tap serf a a bluetooth speaker for my dot making it more like the echo but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere it ha really good sound much like my echo it also work great in the app and syncs with all my other product
easy fast and portable great fun for everyone
rather would have the fire stick a it is smaller and cheaper i feel a though it ha the same feature
the echo is pretty awesome especially if you have smart home thing my kid play game with it and can ntrol our entire audio and video library a little pricey but worth it imho
this version should have been marketed to child only it is like a very dumbed down cheap version of the better firehd and hdx screen is not a good battery life is bad no mirroring to tv and it is slooowww a can be if you have never owned another kind of kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version for those that know what a real kindle should be like you may want to pa on this one another version should be along soon and since they cannot get much worse than this one you ll probably get a better one i got mine on black friday for a little over total with shopping disunts and i m still sending it back that is how disappointed i am with it
with knowing not much about amazon since i do not use the website much this is a great first tablet easy to use and navigate
able to read in all type of light great reader for on the go and on the road
do not support google my son uld not view his grade
i got this on an impulse buy mostly for my hour flight but also just in general wa in line buying something when i saw this at an unbelievable price so i bought it and have no regret for the price it is a great tablet though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the android app store which limit you but that is alright a i mostly got it for watching video and movie and that sort of stuff and occasionally some game
got here quick ha a great speaker and all the feature are amazing and they keep adding more
bought this during the black friday sale and really a nice tablet the ui uld be a little better but ok for a device
very nice tablet for the price only problem it sort of tie you up to be an amazon subscriber for a fee so beware of this
my send purchase new font is very readable in any light and especially outdoors the battery life is great no recharging every night like a phone or tablet
love the apps his old fire stood up to significant wear tear and drop so i m expecting the same with this one year warranty give piece of mind
it wa a gift it wa a gift it wa a gift it wa a gift
screen is very vibrant and bright great lor pretty easy to use even for a beginner it is big enough to see well but easy to hold fit in a purse easily
you will have a lot of fun playing with echo during the holiday
got the tablet for my grandson he is happy with it and use it a we speak
tablet is very good i have a lot of apps and pretty much do my homework there
disappointed to realize there is not a light for night reading size and weight is great
the kindle paperwhite give me the freedom to read where ever i go whether in sunlight for darkness it is easy to read and with the plethora of title available there is never a dull moment
i got the kindle so that i uld read book outdoors tablet ha a glare and cannot see screen this is perfect easy set up easy to sync
this tablet is great for kid and maybe some adult too i got it for my year old niece and she love it perfect for her book and game
this is a fantastic little speaker with the power of amazon alexa i use it to stream spotify pandora andespn radio small speaker fill the garage like a ncert hall battery last hr and the charging stand uld not be simpler to use
doe what they want game educational apps and ha parental ntrols
so far the tablet work great i got this for my daughter for christmas and she downloads game no problem the gb is great i m glad i purchased the larger storage capacity
five star for charging it doe not seem right to give a low rating to something so basic just because i returned the whole kindle package so star for just being a charger in full disclosure i did not use it but have no reason to detract from it it is a wall charging base it charge
i purchased this tablet for my kid age and they love them
unbelievable quality reader is even better at nighttime
this is a great tablet for my year old boy it wa inexpensive at on black friday i particuly prefer it because with my amazon prime acunt i can download video to it amazon only let is amazon product download video it wa great when we traveled at christmas no more dvd and player needed
even though i own both an ipad pro and an ipad mini this is my preferred e reading device it is light and the battery last a good ten time longer than my idevices
not the greatest small tablet and amazon doe have it locked down pretty well but it function
me on for a tablet value value value
great buy if you are not needing the backlight easy to use and battery last for week
not a bad product but you only need this if your streaming or viewing k ntent on a k tv
kindle fire is good because of the other thing you can do besides just reading book but it is slow and hard to read in sun
i have an ipad but thought i would buy this black friday to play around with and program to give to my mother to enjoy
very easy to hold and read in the evening without hurting your eye love it
great clarity for a tablet of this price point amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf the only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking picture in poor light however given the dollar per value you cannot beat it attractive look good fit and finish make it stand out in a sea of choice
this wa a very good purchase it is really easy to use
excellent tablet for the money best for amazon prime member although even non prime amazon user can make the most out of this tablet at this price point
i purchased a samsung is and is edge and they are even better than the previous phone i have owned
good tablet for the price doe not have great wi fi capability but great tablet for on the go and for kid the mb expansion slot wa the selling point very happy with it
i have been ntemplating on expanding into a smart home for quite some time and getting the echo wa a great first step i hope to get pretty good at it is function it is easy to use regnizes my voice very well and pretty much doe what i ask
this device is truly a great purchase for me a i want something very small for a recent travel trip i went on it made everything simple
alexa ha been amusing and informative to say the least she is a wealth of information she save time and energy also
the kindle paperwhite reader is great for reading in the dark it very light and easy to maneuver the page i have not tried reading it outdoors yet but when summer time me i ll be using it alot
i like this is great i bought it my friend he wa pleased abount
i m a prime member so this wa a no brainer wish you uld get the pirate version like the stock though
i used this on a daily basis one of the best gadget so far
the amazon reader is everything i dreamed it would be i can read in the dark it help me get to sleep sooner because the light is not a bright my love of reading ha only increased a great purchase no doubt about that
this tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand time and the screen wont crack i bought the hd when it came out for my daughter i just had to replace it because it wa not charging anymore it wa not the rd itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the rd wa plugged in the best quality tablet i have ever seen amazon ha a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet
we love the amazon fire it is so easy to hook up and so easy to use great resource for movie watching series and just about anything you uld be interested in
it is a great simple tablet easy to use anyone can use it it
this product wa easy to install it allows me to view thing on my television i previously uld not now i have a smart tv plus it give me access tomany other website and viewing option
i bought this looking to get rid of expensive cable and i love it i can pick and choose what i want to watch instead of being charged a flat rate
this tablet is great for the price get everything done quick and easy
i am not a savvy table user i actually do not like tablet to start with i prefer my nvertible window laptop but there is a bible app called youversion that is very useful to me and my iphone screen is too small and my laptop is too big to carry to church so this tablet is perfect for me upled with a leather case it is easier to hold and enjoyable to use i got it on sale from best buy for tax it is a great deal at this incredible price
my yr old granddaughter love this item perfect
we love our amazon firetv box it doe so much for such a nice price
i purchased of these tablet on black friday we have enjoyed them a lot i wa worried about the clarity of game since they are not hd but they are fantastic lot of free book apps game very happy with my purchase
it is amazing and it work great in another room from the amazon alexa that we already have
my yo grandnephew and yo daughter love them the tablet doe freeze but that is what happens sometimes they love them
good
sound is great cannotalk to echo from any room on same floor
so far the echo ha been great but there is a limited amount of skill and a lot of them are very useless once i add the accessory tonmake my home smarter i can get more use out of it the speaker are incredible hope to have one or a dot in more room
perfect for what i need to use it for movie etc great for a gift
i have owned a uple of kindles this one is my favorite thus far the screen is a little too sensitive for my liking but other than that great
did not need a large tablet just something to use in my spare time ha all the feature i need from book to game and can also axcess my email the price wa very good under
a nice update to the original w usb power adapter despite how wonderful the w usb power adapter is for kindle fire i still actually prefer to use this oldie but goodie due to the way the w fold i actually prefer not to have the pointy bit lack of a better term fold away a this cause problem when trying to connect it to something new i actually prefer this to charging my kindle fire faster a the w is really for the regular e ink kindles like my kindle voyager now the w is fine for traveling and if you leave the charger plugged in but this new sleek and black and white charger work and turn head with a white or black rd depending on if you still have those old white rds laying about
this wa a move up from the paper white reader i like the option of touch screen or using the pressure switch on on the side which you can adjust to your pressure that you prefer sharp font refresh is fast and clean
this is a great product from ncept to execution and nstantly expanding functionality and capability also very unexpected sound quality from this little tube impressive
bought this a a gift for my girlfriend and she is over the moon about it she is already purchased dozen of book to read on it and carry it around wherever she go i d say that is the sign of a great product
wa tired of using my ipad a my sole reader decided to go back to kindle this is by far the best amazon ha done in the kindle arena yet simplistic sleek no more eye strain
purchased a a gift for my year old and she love it perfect size detailed graphic good battery life for those long road trip and a sd card slot is a sweet bonus
easy to set up and use we use her all the time to set alarm check weather turn light on and off listen to music etc i liked it so much i bought one for my mom and brother for christmas
i like using them so much that i bought one for everyone in the family and i have three at home
young reader do not have to keep up with a book the tablet is good for young reader
love it very nice really easy to navigate and it ha a lot of thing ntrol remote easy to operate
i used to use ipad a a reader but my eye got tired easily kindle just like the book and the battery can last longer
i thought the tablet wa great for the money did not like having to go online and print the direction did not like how touchly it wa
i have been reading on a paperwhite for a few year now when it got damaged i just went right out and bought another it is light easy to see without my reading glass since i can change the font and it is great for reading outside even in full sun it is worth every penny
perfect for travel and home we have in our house and everyone love them

i love my new fire such a smooth running tablet i can use audible a well on this and netflix and fun game battery last long time a well
excellent nice solution to non smart device if you use with a smart tv the tv remote will also run amazon tv we use it with a projector and usb audio for the sound
i use for weather traffic ordering on amazon music audible book on tape now audible for dog
easy to setup and many addons to use i now use my fire more than my tv
purchased this for my mother a a gift she u mainly apple product so there wa an adjustment to switch over to amazon apps if you are not familiar with amazon then this may be an adjustment from google or apple good for beginner and the price i liked that there wa use for additional storage for a mini sd so hopefully i can store movie on there for her
best device ever do not use my bose radio any more
my wife ha a regular tablet but screen is not good for outside reading at the beach or pool got her thekindle paperwhite and she is thrilled great purchase
this is a great starter tablet for kid and adult alike it is always at a great price and work beautifully
i actually bought this one for a friend a i already have one she read all the time and i told her this is what she needed i m not even sure she ha taken advantage of all the other option that me with it but she love it for reading her book she is an older lady so i help set it up for her and have not had to help her do anything else she ha been able to navigate thru it with no other help greatest gift i uld have given her
it is fun to read with the dictionary and footnote at your finger tip the key benefit is the easy reading with the background light would not drain your eye after hour of reading ordering book from amazon is easy and cheaper than buying the hard py love it
tablet work well for a kid easy for our almost year old to navigate between activity hard to beat with the case and year warranty
this is a huge hit a a gift for my year old daughter
i recently bought an amazon fire tv because we re planning on getting rid of our cable service however when i got it home i realized my current tv is are too old to use it i cannot say how it is working yet simply because now i have to upgrade my tv is
great device for an extra set up in the house and to use when phone is not handy
this is great tablet for reading purpose easy to download surf and read the desired book with great text quality on top of that it me with affordable price
this wa a life saver on our recent cross untry flight it wa nice not having to worry if my three year old wa too rough with it knowing it had a great amazon warranty
i had this for over month and i m liking this more and more it ha a lot of potential st of hardware wise it is the best of the bunch it can support up to a k display ha an ethernet port and a microsd slot it is small and mpact so i cannotuck it way from sight this is fast virtually little to no lag everything is smooth and responsive if i did have to mplain it is the time to start up the unit from a ld start nd it is based of of android so the potential to root and install a medium player is a possibility rd rarely ha any buffering issue why did i bring this up it all depends on your provider when i ha fios and hardwire the fire player to the router it keep buffering i do not know why i have up down when i changed provider twc spectrum i have zero buffering issue to me i think fios is throttling hd ntents to sum it up this is way better than the stick because of the hard wiring capability mirsd slot for expandable and this is freaking fast then the stick well worth the extra
excellent product for an ereader very user friendly
great to give to the little one so they do not break my phone found it at a great price and used reward to bring the price down more
this is a great streaming device easy to use and user friendly it say it play k which is a plus i have streamed amazon and p vue on here and read that game can be played too i am a chrome cast user so am used to managing everything on my phone not a remote but the remote is nice and ha voice ntrol which is great i just wish the fire tv app would show what you see on screen so you can navigate from your phone instead of having it look like a mousepad it take getting used to overall it is great addition to my streaming device
a great cheap alternative to expensive tablet it ha everything that an expensive tablet ha i am giving star because the camera lens is not very good but then again what do you expect for something under buck
i have had the echo for a uple of week now it is gather a better grasp of my mmands with every use little expensive for the add ons but worth it
this tablet keep them occupied other kid enjoy it while they are around with them it keep them entertained
for adult or child the amazon fire tablet is impeccable it ha pertness ntrol for parent with young child if you have a amazon acunt it syncs right to it overall flawless
good beginner tablet light enough for small hand to carry i got the ver a well which wa a good investment a little hand tend to drop thing not a lot of space but enough

we got this tablet for our toddler the setup wa going great installed all the apps from amazon and transferred them to his acunt then we went to load netflix for him to say it is been frustrating with the netflix app is an understatement we had to mpletely reset the tablet to factory setting twice netflix doe not work well with this tablet it either take too long to load and time out or will not load at all it take several attempt to get netflix to load but then it work that is the only mplaint other then that it is great
bought this for a friend she loved it she always wanted a kindle for reading z she is an electronic worm i am glad she loved it
great tablet for the price doe everything that i need it to do
not too expensive and the kid have their own tablet to do stuff they want to do just use the parental ntrols the quality is pretty good too
purchased this for my year old mother to primarily use a an e reader it seems a this may be easier for her to see than an actual book she doe not always find new technology easy to use but seems to be doing ok with this tablet she also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other game
th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular which i prefer the kindle unit itself is rather nice the auto rotate and adjust being the best part i returned this item b c the ver is flimsy and i wa afraid i would drop it and break the kindle
i have not finished setting this up but the demo section explains how to setup alexa seems ready to follow the mmands
my entire family ha fun playing music and asking alexa question a great purchase for our home
the new kindle voyage is quite a step forward for the kindle dedicated reader line it is a beautiful device almost like something from apple i like the lighted screen and the page forward and back button on the side of the device but it is rather pricey not yet nvinced it is worth the upcharge
the back light is a great addition to this kindle along with the page press it is perfect for only using one hand to read i would highly remmend this kindle and is worth the extra money
got these for our kid when we go on vacation easy for them to use
great for entertainment and easy to use just give echo a mmand and it will respond
much quicker than the fire tv stick a nice upgrade
bought this to use in my basement after i decided to cut the rd this item work awesome and is exactly what i needed the main reason i purchased it wa to stream p vue but there are many other device that do that now not at all disappointed with this item
this is a great tablet for this price display is very nice and you get all the feature of android in this the camera and speaker are not so great though excellent gift for new tablet user
this tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the kid tablet or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go the video on amazon website show a better picture while streaming video amazon one touch is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchase unless you do not mind a lot of purchase in short they make it too easy to purchase item by mistake i thought i wa on prime video and notice that i wa charged for an episode of warehouse since i didnsee the show and caught this quickly i wa able to chat with amazon customer care and they walked me through how to change that setting online this tablet not for me since i m looking for a higher end medium tablet with more memory than the gb this unit ha
i had known amazon wa going to release the next generation a few week after i bought this one otoh my wife is happy with it it just offended my geek side however it ha alexa and integrates well with my philip hue equipment
met all my expectation and the alexa app is pretty ol
this is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trip

this tablet work perfect for me reading book on it i love the option to have the blue light disabled so i can read mfortably in the dark
i just brought and no i ha had success pairing the device amazon doe not have any tech assistance and the direction are for a remote but w o a smart tv i do not think you can get much from the device
this wa exactly a advertised and did everything that wa claimed setup wa fast and easy and i have no mplaints

i bought one of these on black friday on impulse since it wa and i had a certificate to use i have a third generation ipad and am quite accustomed to using it and the app store pro o is android based and not too hard to pick up mpared to apple i did find version of a lot of favorite apps and game to download it cannotake up to gb microsd card for expanding storage only gb built in i got a gb class card at st for n screen resolution is only x but i cannot say it is super noticeable in normal use not all apps available even if an android version exists much more useful if you have amazon prime a it tie directly to an amazon m acunt and in fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it battery life is not impressive either with standby time in particular not great for the price it is a handy spare internet connected device i m not one to buy kindle book but the one i do have are certainly easy to access and read

great streaming device for non smart hdtv a must for any home
this tablet is sturdy and great for my kid with game and learning
bought this for my son and he love it nstantly on it got a great price during the holiday mpletely satisfied
wish the kindle fire for kid had better way to limit how many item you can download at once most kid do not understand that clicking on a bunch of picture will download that game program which is clog download time need a better way to remove unwanted item rather than clicking and clicking on every item speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet app store is great and ha many item
i think the echo are terrific personal assistant this is my send large echo i like the larger speaker in the big echo but i also like the dot well enough to buy five of them alexa is all over my house
this is a fun and nvenient toy however it doe not have the capability to answer a many re question a i would have thought
make for a great alarm and reminder device i own dot and the tap use them all
i have grown very accustomed to having alexa around there are new skill added on a very regular basis i really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song radio station podcast to be played i also enjoy having book read to me since i m not much of a reader the setup wa super simple so simple that i wa not sure that i wa all ready to go with such minimal effort the battery life is very long and the speaker suit me just fine i feel that there is a bright future for the tap and i am going to enjoy trying more thing that this gadget ha to offer i m not sure i needed this item but i cannot imagine not having it around now so pleased with this purchase
i bought the fire for my husband to play his game on he enjoys it but it is not a fast a he d like
this tablet ha many educational game for a preschooler
bought two for grandkids so they might read more and it ha worked they enjoy carrying them when traveling also taking book wherever they go
need a cheap alternative to a tablet this is it
fast support ultra k expandable memory side load apps what is not to love
picked this item up on halloween nite great ntent and show will remmend to friend and family
the camera not quality picture but all else great
i purchased a fire stick month ago i like the product but wanted something more the fire tv is the way to go the extra money for the fire tv is well worth it
great tablet for my kid great price great performance
this thing is great she ha a response for everything i love it music quote joke time and weatger a real one stop shop
i got it because it is my mom is favorite lor it is got some powerful speaker i can hear her on it from two room away
i connected my fire hd and another tablet to this power fast adapter and got a low power connection message i purchased charger and will be returning them the fire tablet charging process took a very long time i eventually unplugged it and connected to another charger
great value on a tablet i bought this for travel at if you lose or drop it you are not out is of dollar it performs great
alexa ha changed our life get one get one now
this is another standard kindle lor screen product that replaced our original kindle this one is much faster and ha more access to apps although they are all through the kindle store not android app store i uld not for example use my mcafee anti virus i had to use the one that amazon approved over all a very good upgrade
this wa a present for my son but he seems to be enjoying it so it must be ok
i have purchased several fire stick through out my house this one thus far a been the best loving the voice search it is like having siri on your tv
i bought this tablet for my son after the digiland tablet i bought him broke the same exact day we have had this tablet for almost a year and it is still going strong i just changed the case and screen protector still work perfectly for belonging to an year old boy
i got it for my son it user friendly and durable
good but unhappy that screen size is small le than i expected
i use it for downloading and reading book it is the perfect size for this purpose it is also very light
had a firestick previously this is far superior like this a lot more then the basic new firestick and bestbuy got it to me within day when everyone else wa sold out
bought this for my daughter she love it inexpensive work great and she ha a lot of fun with it
great product for your money excellent quality and feature
this device is the olest thing in my house i speak it listens who uld ask for anything better joking aside it will spoil you when it me to day to day event and search
it uld be a uple of square inch bigger but it great ability to adjust background light is fantastic
this is just the right size and price for my kid for just playing the game watching netflix or just cruising the net this is a great value
this is a pretty good streaming player much better than the roku we have only thing i wish this had is the google play store other than that it is really good
mpared to the cheaper model this one stream a lot faster and smoother
awesome product would purchase again i highly remmend
the amazon fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e book and watch your video
i upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old kindle died i like the paperwhite screen i hate that the pop up add and remmendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history it is very different from earlier kindles so i m still learning feature i cannot understand why the paperwhite sts time what the kindle fire sts
this is a christmas gift but the review i have read on it are excellent
my wife needed a new kindle her previous one just died she love the new size feature and screen much improved mpared to her original kindle i highly remmend if you are in the market for an e reader
i purchased echo on a lark after being intrigued by several review i already owned two harmony remote one is an elite and several automated light switch ntrolled through an insteon hub from smarthome i can now ntrol most of my light and home theater with voice ntrol streamed christmas music throughout the christmas season and great for getting the weather and news of urse all device must be on the same wi fi network be careful if you re an amazon prime member echo responds to everyone have been issue reported that child have ordered product on amazon without parent knowledge
we liked bringing the latest technology into our home
i m liking this tablet more and more the more i use it great battery life easy to use
awesome speaker and alexa is very helpful i bought it for the bluetooth speaker and alexa is a bonus
this ha a great ui i have used all the different streaming device and this is by far the cleanest fastest and offer a lot of app selection work great with playstation vue
i am amazed with this tablet for the price i expected something cheaply made to last a short while i wa wrong very sturdy yet light enough not to give you hand arm cramp while holding it for long period of time if you have any downloads you will need a separate sd card for memory the down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory the standard gig will only hold what the machine need and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up i put in a gig card and downloaded several movie and book and it still have a ton more space and run really fast no streaming issue we recently took it on a week long vacation and it wa great to have downloaded game book movie etc for the teen to watch play overall a great product for a really great price
easy to read book this way enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon
like a tablet great fast connection everything i wanted in an electronic reader
sometime it just stay in sleep mode and you have to restart it
i heard about the echo but thought it wa another electronic gimmick i really didnneed hard for an e junkie to say no my brother visited a few week ago and nvinced me it wa worth it so we found one at the local best buy and bought it it is odd how many time we walk by now and ask question growing up decade before the internet i wonder how dangerous i would have been using it when i wa younger ah well
i wa not sure i wanted to get this new device but i have found that it help me a lot through out my day when i just need to remind myself to do something before i leave the house or after sometime of not getting it down every morning asking about weather instead of having to open a webpage love my alexa and look forward to ntinue growth with her
bought two of these dot for my granddaughter one had asked for one the other did not but both were very happy and excited to get them hope they do not use them to do their homework
this is a product that provides a great value it serf it purpose for the price i paid for it and seems to work well
it is great ton of functionality and the first step in cutting the satellite cable rd
i bought this and i really enjoy using it fit my need
it wa a birthday gift for my son he love it and i use it from time to time i would remmend it and the price is nice
such big sound from a tiny cylinder i originally purchased to only listen to music but end up loving the technology and use the alexa feature almost everyday
this kindle is a basic and easy to use ereader exactly what i wanted the charge last for a long time so you do not have to worry about charging it daily
i am very happy with this amazon tablet i purchased it for business purpose a well a recreational and it work great for both i did get an sd card for more memory also if i would have bought directly from amazon there would have been a month wait however i wa able to order from best buy online and pick it up that very day
love the fire tv cannotell the difference in load time and changing menu would remmend this to criends and family
great little streamer and so much available ntent
i love love love my amazon echo it is the perfect mpanion for my smart home
got this for the family and we all love it great gift
tablet is nice screen is very clear however too many ad pop up during use no way to disable them very frustrating when using if that were rrected i would better be able to remmend this item
i received this a a gift and loved it so much that i bought one for my husband
this thing is used everday i had this guy vincent program it with dy he ha been doing this for several year cable channel movie just like my direct tv
so far so good wife very happy miss her old one
purchased of these table for christmas present and wa extremely surprised with how well they work for the price the amazon environment take a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price
my son is kindle fire finally quit i wa happy to see it in such fun lors at a great price to replace the old one
had purchased one of these for my family for christmas and they absolutely loved it bought the echo dot for a worker and they would not stop talking about it decided to buy my wife this for her birthday and all i can say is wow super easy to set up a blast to use and connects to all sort of connected home device like light switch and wifi router play jeopardy and read you the news in the morning along with playing music on mmand love setting alarm reminder adding to a shopping list and making purchase on amazon by voice definitely buy this if you want to make your home so much dinner
perfect for what i want to use it for nice size too
this is a great tablet for the price i have one that i purchased a few year ago and use it much more than my laptop recently purchased two more for gift
enjoy the multifaceted opportunity that are available with the kindle
amazing product and very useful i love it i remmend
very good tablet for very little money kid love it and it is very durable
alexa is like siri for home i love it i play song cleaning the house or play different genre for get togethers she play rny joke that are funny too anything you ask she pretty much know i remmend definitely
my first purchasing an amazon product i wa very thrilled with the pricing and availabilty
i enjoy this kindle i wa disappointed that the ipad gloss made it difficult to read outdoors at the beach but this paper white make that very possible
it ok tablet but you dont have access to all the same apps that are in google play store also to really enjoy the tablet you should be memebr of amazon prime which i am not
the kindle wa a graduation gift for our son who wa going to travel with friend for a month he usually fill his backpack with a ton of book which he is reluctant to leave behind once read this really lightened his load and he loved being able to read in all light nditions
cannot believe how smooth it work highly remmend it
i really like the echo for ntrolling my hue light sometimes it will do stuff with out even saying alexa though other than that decent product
work well but lack forward ntrol of screen and right and left movement on keyboard good foor short note but uld never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard good for basic websurfing and email
bought these for my kid and they just love them the different lor choice give it a nice personalized touch
i have the echo and a dot and now the tap too my only issue with the tap is that i got it after the echo this mean that by the time i got the tab i wa already used to just calling out mmands or question to my echo of urse with the tap you have to physically get up and touch the tap i think if i had first started out with the tap and having to touch it it would not be so difficult now for me remember to tap the tap but it is a habit to just call out now so i wish i d gotten the tap first and then had graduated to the echo try the tap first you might decide you do not even need an echo you definitely wonbe disappointed
i heard about the kindle from a friend so when the bb clerk told me about the kindle fire i decided to buy one i am very happy that i did now whenever something me up on tv that i do not understand my kindle fire find the info very quickly
wa not happy with first one i opened a christmas gift it didnwork from right out of the box contacted amazon and they sent a new one the next day this one ha worked from the get go i m now enjoying my new tablet very happy with amazon service and prompt response to the issue
switched over from the st gen apple tv to the amazon one and love it cut the cable rd and am using psvue tv on this work great
really good small tablet small and very nvenient great visual quality
overall this is a great product it sometimes freeze with some of the game but other apps work great alexa is a great addition
i love talking to alexa on amazon echo the set up wa fast and easy to do just plug it in and follow the easy instruction that alexa give you i loved it so much i bought one for my brother
this amazon echo literally is a plug and play product even an old man old school non techie like myself wa playing stump the band in no time
bought this during black friday best deal ever would remmeded people
i love how my son ntinues to use this tablet on a daily basis and he is only five year old
i wa looking for a bluetooth speaker and this wa perfect i think in order to get the full benefit it best to be a prime member so you can link your acunt and use prime music but also be able to utilize the tool like shopping list checking past order etc the only downside is it is not wireless i know amazon ha made one that is wireless but i like the design of the echo
bought this for my granddaughter is th birthday she love it the protective case it is in is awesome and the perfect pink for a girl
the fire tv box is the best and fastest steaming player out in the market have device in my house and got rid of my direct tv subscription it is the best
i have had my other kindle fire for year it is still working but slowing down i bought the updated version while it wa on sale i love it i play game on it download book check my email and facebook it is like a portable mini mputer and i would not be without it i like it better than other people is tablet and you cannot beat the price i bought some for gift and everybody love it i d remmend it to people of all age
the amazon k is amazing way better than the stick the box run smoother than the stick and wor
so slow camera not good very low quality of picture get apple ipad mini instead
the echo is very easy to use and get used to the speaker is great quality also i love how alexa give me idea explains how to use the echo and the email that i get along with it are extremely helpful
work great easy to setup and ha great parental ntrols
the tablet is durable and great for kid the best part is the parental ntrol
this is an very good to use in all area the letter are very clear
great product ha so many outstanding benefit love this product
the amazon fire tablet is great for the price great stuffing stocker
this tablet is great for using ebooks a a llege student
perfect for a beginner difficult to hold up while reading in bed a the back shell is very slick great value though
kindle voyage is the stliest of the kindle range but it worth it due to light weight and adaptive backlight enjoying it so far
i am no stranger to amazon tablet a must have for the budget buyer cannot go wrong
great gift for a son who ha everything and love technology his child love asking it question
i own tablet have a surface pro and have a smart phone i have the kindle app on all these device and it work great this issue with them though is that they are not always that nvenient to carry around or if they are the battery will tend to die the paperwhite fix both of these issue it is very light and feel great in your hand the screen is amazing and i never have any kind of issue with being unable to see it due to sunlight a dark room etc but probably most amazing of all is the battery life it is been week since i bought my kindle and fully charged it i just now finally went a little below half battery life i use mine to read book and graphic novel both look fantastic on the device

although i had a roku three that did most of what i needed playstation vue is not available but it is available on the fire tv if you have a prime membership this is probably for you if you are one of the people that do not like me this is nothing but a way for amazon to get you to buy more stuff from them you cannot set the menu is to only show the ntent that you own and the apps that you have downloaded cannot be put first on the list

purchased this to test it out i have a prime membership the interface seems a little slow and not a intuitive a other streaming player however do like the k capability for the price
let is be realistic on two front about the echo ifun to play with a novel idea there are some serious flaw and if you doubt me you cannotry these yourself ask alexa these three question what is the customer service number for ups you ll be told the phone number of your nearest ups store no matter how you phrase the question alexa what is the current humidity outside you ll get the day weather report no matter how you pose the question seriously it cannot even provide the humidity alexa who make the jet you ll hear hmmm i m not sure what you meant by that question so throw in a clue with alexa who make the boeing jet and you ll hear the same answer and this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from wikipedia et al the reproduction of music is egregious at best read anywhere on the internet and you ll see this mentioned time and time again it is very very bad imagine a is transistor radio not quite tuned well the voice quality sound like something from a mmodore back in the is another very mmon mplaint you ll read about in review this is going back tonight not worth the and i feel it is slated to go the route of the pet rock for those who remember it
my year old mom love this she now ha something to do while waiting in doctor office love to read do crossword etc

this is my rd kindle and my last i m moving on to something better for me following all packaging insert guideline they only lasted a year at the most
ok so i wanted an e reader and had thought about just buying an ipad mini i wish i had do not get me wrong this tablet doe the job it is meant to do but that is about it if you re looking for a tablet that you can play game on browse through facebook or instagram on or even surf the net then you re better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an ipad a i said before plus this tablet me packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful however if you just need it to read your book or magazine then this is the perfect little mpanion for you i m saving for an ipad
this product is handy and it sound great when playing music
this thing doe so many thing it is incredible time saver information finder and even a family entertainer
wife love it so make my life better what else do you need to know past that
i spend a lot of time looking at a mputer screen when it me time for leisure reading it is nice to have relief from bright light the paperwhite kindle provides a very eye friendly experience with sharp text even at a small size and there is no struggle with holding open page of a book unlike the kindle fire obviously it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e mail navigation between book is not a easy a i would like a half screen of recent book with the other half taken up by remmended book is not a handy a a full screen text list of my book would be but the actual process of reading is easy and there are a few tool for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight section of text cross book text searching is a great feature if you need it too
this is my send pw and my th kindle over the year i do not know of a better way to nsume book read on the kindle catch up on the iphone further on the ipad and back to the kindle
great for reading book on ha lot of other feature a well

alexa is great for quick info and sometimes her response to question are fun to listen to
i wanted the charger block with the folding power tine but not available so i got this one and it work very well and i like it a much a the other type
useful around the house put it in the kitchen and can use it for timer reminder asking for sport sres faster than changing the channel on the tv and checking myself tell me a joke is usually pretty good too now looking into connecting other thing to it like light switch etc
small and light weight easy to read from in bright light nditions
i purchased others for my yr old and my yr old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much i then bought this one for her the included yr subscription to free time is awsome for the kid parental ntrols are great and included apps are helpful the lower rating is because the charging port wa extremely loose a the rd fall out all the time very frustrating

i started with a basic kindle four year ago after two year i purchased the kindle fire hdx i have been very satisfied with it now i also have the new kindle fire so when one is charging i can use the other device
love it and would probably be just okay using the fire stick do not need all of the extra storage space and the capability of k re only beneficial if you have a k tv
i purchased fire tv because you can download apps onto it so i can use directv now easy setup and ha worked great
i have not really been a reader in the past i thought maybe i d enjoy reading at the beach and so i tried my tablet it blew i uld not see the screen it had a glare the ereader ha been great and i m reading more than at the beach now it work well no issue wish it wa waterproof sandpfoof

i needed to replace my much older kindle paperwhite i love the new one i use it regularly at the beach
alexa is a lot of fun i use it every morning to get the news and to listen to music
i really enjoy the versatility the alexa is it ha so many posibilities
this wa a christmas present for my wife is sister she is tech challenged after i initially set it up for her she ha really been enjoying streaming music and talk radio
i have enjoyed my kindle paperwhite very very much it is an excellent ereader for me a my eyesight is not what it used to be and the backlight really help is keeping the text readable especially in low light situation it wa a wonderful christmas present from my dear spouse
the sale rep told me this kindle fire tablet is easy to set up just follow the direction three hour later a trip back to the store a member of the geek squad finally got my e mail to work he uld not tell me why it wa a problem also the camera quality is very poor if you use it to check your e mail and browse the web it fine other than that oh well
awesome tablet purchased for kid they love it
very happy with my purchase
best hand free speaker for a beginner my daughter love it
if you do not want or need something cheaper than an ipad but of quality this is a great happy medium the processor make for a fluid ride with it it is speedy the android store give you good app option and the amazon esphere is everywhere here the software is a touch buggy but it is still a great deal of a tablet for a child for something you want to use casually on a dime it is remmended
bought this black friday for buck cheap but reliable and nice i would remmend this to everybody it is fast and nice looking
bought this a a gift and the giftee really love it
me and my brother brought this for our mother on mother day she cannot put this thing down shout out to amzon for this amazing product
wa a gift for a friend who enjoys how nvenient and light it is
i have never had so many issue with a kindle and i have purchased alot it is slow it shuts off whenever it want the sd card dosent read half the time and when it doe it seems to be downloading it and it deleted apps off my other kid kindle or add when i do very very stupid it ha cracked and i have never dropped it it is not made well i am going to return it and i will probably never buy another kindle horrible
just gave them a gift for christmas i have bought kindles in the past and have been happy with them my only disappointment wa when i ordered the kindles i paid only to have the price go to day later
my only mplaint is that the charger doe not fit in snugly to the device and i have replaced several device a i uld not get it to charge they should take a look at apple product and how they are nstructed
navigating around the tablet can be somewhat nfusing at time but for the price you cannot get a better tablet
easy set up great for music streaming this is my nd echo got last one thanksgiving sale so happy i did
great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trip
wife never leaf it at home love it great display easy on your eye
this is a terrific tablet at a great price the quality is excellent the price is right it ha ton of storage capacity and oh did i mention that it is cheap cheap for a tablet that is
this is a great product and i did research it before buying of them having said that i didnrealize the apps such a instagram and madden mobile we re not available on amazon this wa a big disappointing factor for the young people using the product the other big mplaint we have with this product is the length of the charging rd way too short
with the new update allowing hand free hey alexa mmands this is a great device the battery allows you to disnnect from the wall the sound is very good and fill a small room well with decent level alexa is very accurate most of the time to voice mmands my only mplaint is that bluetooth streaming from device like my iphone or ipad sometimes break up and stutter a bit other than that i think this is a great device
purchased for one of my granddaughter and she love it the price wa right and it work great
the amazon echo is super easy to set up once set up it is actually fun to see what alexa would say to any and all of your question what is great is that even if there is background noise or other people talking at the same time alexa can still hear you and will respond acrdingly
this is a good basic tablet bought it for my year old only mplaint is that it doe not have one of the most popular game despicable me which my son love so he still have to use mine for that plz update software amazon
i m really enjoying my echo there are so many thing it can do you can create a shopping list ask for the weather play music just to name a few the sound quality is pretty good also
i didnthink i would use this device a much a i do now that i have one she is full of information
great for my year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install in a previous tablet he had to ask me to install game video etc but that is no longer the case being able to set time limit is great a well do not have to worry about him spending too much time on the device he understand that after the time limit ha been reached no more tablet time until the next day
i had my first echo for about a year before taking it out the box i set it up in my bedroom and it is a nice additional to all the other electronics i have i purchase a send echo for my living room area a an entertainment device to play game
bought another one because first one stopped working seems to match the cheap price made cheaply
great tablet for child me pre loaded with lot of application for load of entertainment for younger child it also me with a year warranty at time of purchase
this is my th kindle and my st from best buy it wa much easier to purchase on line and pick up at the store a short time later
got it for daughter christmas they love it i have not figured out how to run it yet
love this tablet it is easy to setup and the pre loaded game were a hit with my little one very pleased with the the selection of video and game on amazon kid play
tie in perfectly with my wink hub i am able to ntrol my lamp and overhead light with my voice love it
everything is working great it is a great source of info setting up the voice activation for my smart home at little challenging but making good progress would pick this over the google home anyday
wa super easy to connect via bluetooth great sound fun to use
cannot beat kindle fire already have and got more thanksgiving sale for
easy setup i will buy the send one for my bed room
really like the fire tv work great def an upgrade from the apple tv
the echo is a great addition to my home it is nvenient when we need specific information without logging on to the mputer i m a star trek fan being able to change the mmand to mputer is priceless
got this for my year old son he play with it every now and then but it is good for introducing him to educational thing glitchy at time but that is to be expected with how much it st
cheap tablet that run great and play hearthstone silky smooth
bought for my daughter for christmas she loved it
i had the old version of the kindle and loved it but now that i have the paperwhite i realize what a good decision it wa to trade up the ntrast is like reading a real book and it doe not hurt your eye to read it for a long time
i remmend to all great speaker and easy to move about anywhere around the house it keep getting better each month i bought one for my parent and they to are loving it to so simple anyone can use it
this is the perfect tablet for someone who will just be doing web surfing and video watching price point is perfect
very satisfied with this item very user friendly even the kid use it frequently
product is great and battery life is long my kid and i enjoy using it to read long and short novel it is a must get to have great to take with you to bed and read with low dim
this wa a present for my mother it wa exactly what she wanted she find it easy to use and allows her to read kindle a well
got this for mom to replace an aging ipod she wa using she is reluctant to adopt any new technology but i have loaded all of her apps and saw her on occasion slowly warming up to the device the only issue i have with amazon fire device is that not all google play store apps can be installed for example you cannot have access to google hangout which mom would like to use anyhow it is a good overall device for people who are starting to use new tech item
love the ease and nvenience of amazon echo there are so many thing that she can do with just a voice mmand our favorite is turning on the light ntrolling the nest and playing music
gave this a a gift for my daughter so she can read and now she love it
i bought this tablet because it wa a cheap alternative to use it on roadtrips and watch movie it also is perfect for the kid to play with it without worrying to much if they break it
this is an excellent device however i did take this back and exchanged it for an which i simply love
this wa a replacement for an amazon fire tablet this wa a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one she absolutely loved her old one she say the new one is even better
unlike my first kindle this tablet give me all kind of information advertisement and offer when i first turn it on i uld live without that but overall i am pleased with this new tablet it doe many thing i have not taken the time to explore but hope to soon
great and clear looking screen with a d effect easy set up loving it
i wanted this tablet for reading book checking e ail and playing the occasional game it work very well i have also found the camera very nvenient
excellent and affordable product it came a advertised not top of the line but not at the end of the line more than a fair product good and fast can handle almost all thrown at it resolution is passable
i have several generation of kindle reader and this is far and away the best it is relatively expensive but the feature are worth it
great product and service and the sale man r really nice
i wa looking for a kindle fire because i have had other android tablet in the past and most time the kindle app make them crash or take up too much space on the tablet i like it for reading but it is not a great for other thing and you are not allowed to have the google play store on it because that mpetes with the amazon app store however not all apps are available on the amazon app store so this wa an immediate drawback for me i will keep this and use it but in the future i will not buy kindle tablet again
too slow for game and video i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
it is really a nice addition to our kitchen my wife love the timer and i love the music we also like the various joke and interaction
i have a disability an it is hard to do thing with alexa she help me
bought the new for father is day work well sometimes have to reset it to connect to internet all the apps are easy to access
great for simple use of only reading and able to read in the sunshine
exactly what i wanted far faster better than a firestick the fire tv rock
if you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product i bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone and she absolutely love it battery life is good build quality is great for the price there is really no mparison
good tablet for the price wa looking for a substitute for the amazon fire hd that my son lost and this is a pretty good replacement not that much of a difference
grand son said he liked it that it wa fun to play with he uld do what he needed to do with it glad he is happy with it
this is an awesome tablet very easy to access and read book a well a to add apps
one of the easiest android tablet to learn it is function great a a reading tool but also for setting up email web search easy access to game and various apps nice to have access to a camera a well a great tool for senior with limited mputer experience
this is a great device being utilized by my year old for interactive learning activity do not have anything wrong to say about this this is a great buy
purchased these for my grandson age and they absolutely love them able to download apps with ease
perfect size work great just a advertised ha a long battery life
serf my need a required sound is good ability to move device where required is ideal
work great highly remmend great alternative to cable
love having the echo for listening to music and using it to turn my light on and off by voice with phillips hue lighting system
perfect size exactly what i wa looking for highly remmend this to anyone
i cannot use until i can get the webroot installed i tried a geek but they wanted to do it i only paid that much for the tablet print is so small i can barely read it there is probably an adjustment to font size but i do not want to get online without the webroot protection
bought two of them during the thanksgiving sale for each i mainly bought them for gifting purpose but used one of them myself and wa not disappointed you get what you pay for but for this is the best gift that someone is going to receive
work a advertised small and light will along with my kindle fire
so i bought my little guy these tablet so that i uld repossess my ipad love the free time app but who uld have imagined they would not play netflix so now i m out the money for the tablet and still do not have my ipad back and yes i called amazon numerous time they work after the fix but the next time they go to use them they do not work again the fix take several minute a it is force stopping the app clearing cache then doing a hard restart then you have to wait to restart netflix oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous time before it work if it work at all
my grandson love it will be getting another one
i have an echo i thought so well of it that i gave this one to my son in law
it is small enough to carry in your purse and open up a whole new world while waiting at appointment
worth the money when on sale slow connection mpared to a laptop
the main criticism feedback i have about all electronics ha to do with battery i feel all battery uld be replaceable rechargeable of urse this is not always the case so unless electronic recycling is available feasible non damaging to the planet that is a bit of a blow i still feel technology is great this is no exception downloading non kindle item is a little more involved but still possible i have used like the feature of downloading my own document i have done more reading than i have in many month due to the kindle it is easy to read anywhere font size back lighting are adjustable which creates an ideal reading situation regardless of circumstance wa not sure about the size after reading book the size is perfect in my hand
do not let the summary fool you the reason this is the third one is because of the quality i have bought one for myself one for my son in law and i bought this a a replacement for my mother who u it to read book in her tiny apartment the kindle fire is extremely user friendly and i d remmend it to anyone wanting an inexpensive but reliable tablet
east to use and easy set up weather basic question and most any music on demand
cannot go wrong for the price i would certainly buy another one
great product but every hard to get a hand on one very user friendly
i love the paper white because ican read it if i am out in the sun especially at the beach
i am very happy with fire tv i wa even happier went it went on sale a week after i bought it and best buy gave me the diference back
i really enjoy the fire tablet i also have a ipad but the you cannot go wrong i bought for each of my kid so they leave my ipads alone lol
always loved the amazon echo now we can rake it with u outside wherever
need to have some mputer savvy wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instruction
bought this for my wife for christmas we have been using a nook for the last year bought at best buy got and a great deal cannot use nook to read in sunlight the voyage is smaller lighter and easier to use have not used it yet to read in sunlight wish it had some other feature like lor display and sound waiting to see if i decide to get one until then i still am using a nook very easy to download a book from public library it is a tad expensive for what it doe
it doe what it say it doe straightforward to set up too
it is great each of my kid received one last month for christmas age we gave it to them mostly for reading and they love them yes the younger two game on them and watch their show a well but most of the time i catch them reading i thought the ad would bug them but they only appear when you initially turn on the device and that is it no one is said a thing good screen quality too we purchased a g sd card for each tablet for more storage
i take this with me when i do not want to carry heavy book white background much easier to read than original gray
i had one of the original kindles for about year and enjoyed it very much after it wa stolen from my office i got the kindle paperwhite other than having to get used to doing everything by touchscreen i like it even better than my old kindle i especially like the backlight and of urse having everything stored in the cloud meant i didnlose all of my previously purchased book i do wish it had multiple static picture to display when turned off the way the old kindle did i do hope whoever stole my old kindle enjoys their new paperweight because that is all that it is good for except for the book already on it i had it locked down a soon a i disvered it missing
work great having a physical internet connection work great for streaming
i bought three of these a christmas gift for my grand son age i didnthink about the type of playstore available for them to get game they were disappointed a they were unable to get some of the game they were used to in the playstore unless they paid for them one of them ha to be returned a it will not hold a charge which ha been frustrating for the child who is trying to play his game
we bought this for our grandaughter she love technology and this ha all the basic thing she need or will use smaller size fit her hand well
purchased two for my twin girl and they love simple they can download apps and watch video only thing the charger are working not only after a week
purchased this for my fiance is youngest son for christmas and also to replace his broken no name handheld he loved it the speed ease of use and size were perfect for him he mostly u it for music youtube and instagram all of which seem to work fine on it it wa also very affordable he is happy with it so we are too
my son love this tablet because of all the apps on the store we love it because of the parental ntrols allow u to ntrol what he get in the app store lol
the product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspect
i have both apple tv and amazon fire tv love the k display and feature that amazon fire tv ha the alexa feature is great a well
we bought three including one for my year old we all love it the only mplaint is the volume there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablet with two speaker it doe not bother u too much but that is why we give it star overall a great tablet
i wanted a tablet for easy internet access and an e reader this is easy to use and ha exceeded my expectation
everything i wa looking for and more clarity and brightness
i bought the amazon fire tv about a month ago i reviewed the roku apple tv and chromecast this one wa rated the highest and i have not been disappointed i also have the apple tv it wa more and difficult to operate for my wife
much harder to work than an android none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device many of the other apps look cheap on the display other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper tablet they make it look like an android tablet but it is not no google play everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under it exceeds expectation it is more responsive than other model of fire
i have used different streaming android box and apple tv over the year love this one start up super fast and remote is very responsive i mainly purchased it to use it with kodi but i like how easy you can browse amazon prime video i remmended it to a few friend and family they all love it
i love my new kindle i have owned them all and each one improves on the last it is a great way to read i have the origami book ver a well and did not expect to like it but actually i love it
this is a ol tablet for entry model ha everything you need to get going it a little difficult for a child but they can catch on quick
i never thought i would buy a kindle fire but i had purchased prime and disvered to be part of their lending library you have to use an amazon product well lucky for me amazon had just released this fire i purchased it thinking the worst that uld happen is i would be out well to my surprise the little tablet work very well it is a perfect mplement to the prime service and i have been very very pleased it is not a samsung or an ipad by no mean but for what it can do it doe it very well i guess the best part to me like i said is it mpliments the prime service beautifully the o is system is almost flawless for watching video or reading book or the internet the only reason i gave it star is that it is not a good a the others overall but for it is well worth it
good phone but my return visit the customer service wa horrific
this thing doe everything and only buck i use it everyday
very sceptical about getting the amazon tv box but once i decided to get it the family and i were releived that we bought the box it ha many function and apps including hulu and netflix a must buy
an inexpensive tablet wa the request on the angel tree at my son is middle school and we didneven have to think twice about it unfortunately we get no feedback on the performance of these gift but we hope and pray that it brings some happiness to the recipient god bless u everyone
i absolutely love the fire tv box it is amazing
this is much better than an ipad or android tablet for reading cannot go wrong
we have a lot of technology in our house this is one great way to streamline and simplify the system
my son washed it twice throw it a few time and it is still ticking
love my new echo work well pro easy to install doe not take to much room the sound is crisp my only grip is i paid more then what the price wa in xmas
easy to use no trouble downloading book from free site
echo alexa is a nice bluetooth wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it question can sync with your phone via using the amazon alexa app speak it in the air
great product just a i expected
it is so easy to read on the kindle it work inside or outside how did i ever make it without my kindle
i bought one and remmended this product also to my family and friend
i purchased this so my daughter uld read her online book perfect size
great for my kid and is easy to block purchase even better if you have amazon prime
easy to setup and install only took a few minute to hookup and watching movie simple to use and navigate
i bought this to use outside by the pool perfect
we purchased this tv for a guest room office it ha an excellent picture and great sound
worked fine for a month then refused to take a charge returned to best buy and advised that amazon like to handle their own warranty issue stuck with a store credit card i suppose it will get used but not impressed with the product at all
it is ok i would remmend it to friend for sure in the future
it is very easy to use and i love that it syncs with my phone app for holding my reading spot
this tablet is great not just for adult but also kid after having this tablet i ll never go back to a different brand
work perfect and the price is right for my need
i took it back the day after purchasing it the screen look like you are scrolling through old news print black out each moment you move it i thought it wa a defect but nope acrding to the geek squad that is just the way it is now
we are really happy we purchased our echo we really enjoy simply asking alexa question and the music selection is great we simply say alexa play a dean martin song and here it me if it is something we really like we simply say alexa a little louder it is a lot of fun with a small investment and best buy is the place to purchase
amazon killed the tablet market by introducing this for a high quality tablet needle to say everyone got one for christmas easy to use and great quality just a wierd packaging
my son u this to take note in class and read material related to class it ha helped him by not having to take along extra book to class
my kid love these i purchased of them at one time they seem really durable
love using this so easy to download and find book so easy to store the battery life is amazing it is like reading a book without the hassle of the space being able to look up word while reading it amazing the only thing i wish is that i had gotten one sooner
actually love the mfort of get answer with few word some time it get is nfused so make sure there is no background noice there are so many feature i love
fantastic product at an affordable price and fast delivery
i love the size and the hd quality just what i wa looking for downloads apps really fast
i basically use it to read news article and story online it work well for what i use it for
got for reading amazon book work great would remmend
in the past i have avoided tablet at such a low price point and while i wa skeptical of this one a well it ha been a great purchase i use it for task i would normally do on my phone such a web browsing streaming video reading and android game it performs all of these task admirably battery is great a well i can get up to hour depending on the task at hand it is small enough to always have with me typing this review on it now yet large enough to give that real tablet feel a opposed to my phone i have already purchased another for a friend at this price you cannot go wrong
easy to use and set up to get started set is up for both of my child
have had no problem with the unit work a advertised
i use this for p vue and work great knocking a star due to ethernet issue and for some reason espn app keep dropping the connection
i prefer this version of the kindle to the previous generation it ha a backlight that can be adjusted easily and it light weight i did have a crack appear in my screen and it made the backlight shine through awfully bright in that area unsure how it happened but amazon replaced it nonetheless
while there is absolutely nothing wrong with this item the kid get more fun from it than i do it is extremely impressive with it prompt response and info
bought dot for myself and this one for my parent they are in their is and they use amazon to play music and i use it to drop in on them they also use the echo to call me in an emergency
for someone on the go this is ideal for eliminating the hastle of always keeping your phone on a charger last several day if you have charged it family member go to school in canada and always traveling ideal for this individual work phenomenal will only take the charger supplied but if an additional is required you may substitute with others out there p if in a pinch it work
this is a good tablet it wa bought for my son who is year old
i love this echo it is literally one of my favorite gift that i purchased for my family we love how it understands very well and doe almost exactly what we say whenever i forget something for food shopping i literally ask alexa to put it in my cart and it doe just that it is the perfect little helper around the house just what i needed
now i have fire tv in all my room is a great product you can do a lot of thing
we had one before and it wa stolen so we got another and loving it a always great thing to have on the go or when you do not want a bunch of book all over
this make tv more fun easy setup just plug and play
an excelente producto for a very slow price i recmend the tablet
i use the echo every day from getting weather to daily news to listening to siriusxm i can say the device is very simple to use there are so many skill you can download to make your echo interact with alexa in so many different way it go on sale quite often so wait till it drop below
this is a replacement for a kindle purchased several year ago happy to find the price went down and the product is better than ever i highly remmend a an internet tool for both adult and child
after reading several review i purchased this a my first kindle because it wa not the lowest level kindle but i didnneed all the bell and whistle of the more expensive one i purchased this specifically because of it is size and ability to read outside with no glare issue the ad are not annoying enough to make me wish i paid more for the ad free version it is a perfect price point for reading outside and on the go
this device ha amazing feature and is much better than the apple tv with a larger range of available apps one most prominently is sling tv that is not supported by the io device also this version is much better than the fire tv stick due to memory and most importantly the ethernet connection definitely worth the extra amount over the fire tv stick
the kid program option are great do not like that i have to register tablet in order to buy anything though
the new kindle fire is price point is amazing at this tablet is a full featured device that is practically disposable
i purchased this tablet a a gift it is a nice little tablet for the money
my girlfriend ha been using an ipad for several year she decided she wanted to try the kindle because i liked mine so much so i got one for her for christmas now she is hooked anyone want to buy an ipad
work fast no lagging clear picture much better then the fire stick
the beginning of the end for paid cable got the kodi jail break and can get any series on tv new episode the very next day just awesome
bought it for my mom for christmas so she wonuse up all her data on her phone so far she is really enjoying it and like the screen size great tablet for someone who is looking to just begin
not a bad tablet for the price watch movie and browse internet
this is the nd one we have purchased for our kid they love them
i got the firetv stick more than a year ago it work fine although streaming video from my na sometimesnot very smooth a i found the nbc sport app allowed me to watch olympics on the stick and this firetv wa on sale i upgraded to this box the result is a mix it doe stream video better than the stick but the same app did not work on the firetv a with the stick it keep giving the authorization error in playing some video clip withe same acunt i can play the same video clip on firetv stick or on android box and tablet i decided to keep it simply because of the great price i paid
echo is a great first step into using smart thing linking it with your amazon acunt allows you to stream music from amazon prime or your amazon cloud you can add item to shopping list ask question etc you cannothen start adding smart device in the home to ntrol the possibility ntinue to grow
the paperwhite is very nvenient great battery life i still love book but with the paperwhite i can have multiple book going at once depending on what i feel like reading at the time overall a great product
this is so far the best kindle i have ever owned i love the screen and the resolution on it the device out performs all of the other e reader on the market
great product this is my nd kindle paperwhite mpared price and this wa the best one i found
the echo is a great device the on y drawback is sometimes alexa doe not understand your question other that it is great and with the amazon music it play all of the amazon music you uld not ask for anything else it even play medy bit too
really happy with it easy to set up and every day i find new feature to it
i purchased this kindle case in the saddle tan lor the leather is high quality it ha that wonderful new smell a well and ha beautiful stitching around the border on the front the case doe not add any bulk to the kindle i find it quite mfortable to hold in one hand or two a the front ver fold behind the case and i truly feel like i am holding an actual book while reading at the top of the case there is a plastic arm that pull upward to reveal a light which illuminates the screen of the kindle perfectly in a dark room my eye have no trouble reading with the light activated the light is powered by the kindle itself by way of two metal prong inside the case making contact with two metal tab on the lower back of the kindle the arm for the light doe seem a bit delicate and i uld see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown i fear that over time this will be the first piece to stop functioning a the case is regularly used my only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front ver from opening it would have been nice to include a clasp or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed i paid for this case which is almost a expensive a the kindle itself at that price the designer should have had the forethought to include a mean of securing the case from opening aside from this potential problem this kindle case is perfect and add a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device kudos amazon
love this product and do not know why it took so l
we have the smaller one and been great this one is even better because of the size
we use this to run kodi it work perfectly far better than the fire stick which we also have
i love it i gave it a a gift to my grandchild and they love it we mmunicate through message
with skill too numerous to unt and more being added all of the time the amazon echo is the most useful and used electronic in my house the sound quality is excellent alexa always answer when i call doe what i ask is always pleasant and never asks for money my new best friend
durable and inexpensive just bought two to replace my kid fire that were over and year old respectively
my little girl love this tablet it keep her engaged and entertained it me with a protective case that protects it from fall and the handling of kid you can download apps and with parental ntrol you are protected from your kid accidentally making unnecessary purchase without your knowledge great tablet for kid
finally i can read at the beach and it is super light
if you are a prime member it a good little speaker to have need wifi or hotspot
similar to the tv program jeopardy you need to ask alexa the question in the proper manner
making a gift baskey and choose to place this kindle fire a the main surprise great price
we had a netgear streaming device for year which wa adequate until the remote quit functioning after checking it out online and visiting the store i felt mfortable purchasing this device it wa easy to setup and get online it is amazing how much faster better and smoother our streaming ha been the built in apps are good and there were many more free apps that i found and installed without a problem some that i installed required that i have a cable tv subscription and so i had to log in to get them functional but not a big deal the unit itself is not cheap in appearance nor in quality it ha a nice weight to it and feel substantially durable the remote is great and the android app is even better my local best buy store had enough in stock and no hassle we love our amazon fire tv
without really knowing much about this product i purchased it at the remmendation from some of my friend brought it home and it wa a very easy set up with any type of phone by downloading the echo app immediately i wa amazed at the u we came up with for alexa it play what ever type or specific band artist music you want or weather or tv schedule i keep it in my kitchen most time however the best part is putting it in the bedroom and having it play music and then telling it to turn off in however many minute so that you can fall asleep what a great gadget for every home
alexa is the best she tell me the news play my song and ste the temperature of my home i m definitely enjoying the amazon echo
work great excellent voice regnition tell great joke too
the latest software update included hand free mode so this can do everything that the stationary echo speaker doe but is fully portable personally i do not want the device to rerd everything i say all the time so i only use the tap mode the sound quality is good for a speaker of this size this is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data you can now bring alexa on the go
i had no idea that alexa would tell me joke and play game with me i m still in the process of disvering all of the thing my device is capable of my only disappointment is that i get a lot of i do not know answer to question that i expected it to be able to answer or maybe i m not asking right
easy and fast access to all popular apps appreciate the voice search on the remote
just like the review said the netflix app buffer every few minute awful now i only have to glimpse that spinning red circle and my blood pressure rise i wa hoping i would be one of the minority i finally yanked the hdmi cable and attached it to my mputer to finish watching my program i m not returning the amazon fire tv yet because i recently acquired amazon prime and i have been hearing great thing about their selection of movie etc will update after i have used it for that

i bought a first generation kindle fire a few year back when it wa on sale for something like and loved it it took a bit of a beating and i had recently begun to think about buying a replacement i think that original tablet would probably be more mparable to the fire hd or something so my experience with this version is lored by the higher quality first generation model i also use a surface pro tablet a my personal work mputer so that too probably lor my opinion out of the box this is lighter than the original upon powering up the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen in term of processing speed this version feel a little slow game i had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new fire web browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either in the end if you want a good e reader on a budget with a few extra feature this is a great buy if you re looking for a serious small tablet you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older sibling
cut the rd with this able to stream using showtime anytime hbo go amazon prime netflix and playstation vue excellent interface highly remmend
gave one of these to my sister for christmas who then raved about it she said it wa awesome so i got one i m happy with it and i even got the remote too i especially like being able to tell it to add thing to the shopping list to do list in addition i get a daily news briefing and get the best mmute route for the morning
this kindle ha made life easier by adding the micro sd card slot to enhance the memory capacity up to gb more than it ha built in make it easy to switch card so you can have your whole library on hand without slowing down the overall processing capability

purchased blue unit parenthesis below is error rrection for that review since bb doe not allow edit good bare bone tablet for anyone if that is all you seek do not expect the performance of a tablet for i have wifi bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine no lag on a reliable network this is an amazon based o not a traditional android system so it is all geared toward amazon advertising purchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon acunt which is linked to and display any saved credit card payment data associated with your acunt not very private or secure in my opinion all apps must be obtained from their amazon app store no google play store which is nsiderably simpler there are way around this of urse if you know how one more thing that is important and it is this after more than a week i finally noticed with more use that my screen ha spot with dead pixel which show up a solid white dot and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen after searching reading online it seems there are very many report of these tablet purchased from any source having this issue even read someone who purchased a pack and had several unit with dead pixel test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen you may be fine but it pay to look i did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though i still have the receipt i already discarded the packaging i am at the day point today and uld have still returned it otherwise but honestly for all i use it for i am not overly ncerned still whether or dollar a brand new item should be free of defect again so far i find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bone tablet is all you need
the tablet is fast and my daughter love it she can play on it and also read book
not only did my daughter in law love it i wa able to experience nvenience of having it shipped
love my echo without it ill die it help me with my appointment
i have cut my cable i would have done this before but didnknow how to get llege sport fire with amazon and slingtv ha bridged the gap i receive local channel with an antenna and the fire doe the rest saving about per month
it the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it
this nifty little device is perfect for freeing yourself from the clutch of the evil and nefarious clutch of the dreaded cable empire no longer will you be subjected to their random price raise of their already high price no more will you fret over paying exorbitant fee for channel that you do not even watch yes this firestick can and will open up quite literally an entire new world of viewing for you set up is simple and quick there are a multitude of different apps that u can use to take mplete ntrol over what u want to watch and pay for i m not going to go into specific about how to watch everything you want because we all have different interest a simple google search will help guide you with those specific but just know that for financial freedom from ntracts and rporate giant this is the way to go one downside i will mention is the buffering ensure you have a good internet connection this is a requirement for the device to work make sure u keep the device free of any unecessary apps which will take up it hd also ensure you have a router that is worth while personally i ended up going with the firebox instead of the stick because i wanted the best connection possible and a we all know that requires hard wiring of your device so if u want to replace cable for your main living room tv area go with the box for kid or something get them the stick
i didnreally think i would enjoy it a much a i do absolutely perfect for our master bathroom nstant music weather time and useful info to get the day going
work a described very portable with wifi and bluetooth
you cannot beat the fire stick for the money a great bargain to say the least
i got this tablet for my mom a an additional after x ma gift she like the clean simple no fuss etc way a tablet work ie no keyboard mouse etc just your finger for input
i love it it is easy to read on and a nice size screen for the kid to watch movie on
bought this instead of getting another roku ultra that wa giving me problem this ha a guide that roku doe not and it show you have a new rerding if you have it in my show

i love my kindle i got one for my fiance on his birthday he loved it so i decided to get one for myself a well and i am glad i did it is very easy to read book in it i love the dictionary on this little device normally i just skip a word i do not know the meaning of and try to guess what it mean in the ntext but with kindle i just press and hold my finger on the word i do not know and translation pop up so essentially the meaning of a new word is at your finger tip if you love to read book i highly remmend kindle however if you only read manga or mic book if you are a fan of buying how to draw how to sew book i do not remmend kindle for you it is not easy to navigate trough picture and slide so if you are a fan of reading novel just buy it now if you are a manga fan just buy your manga book from bookstore

the amazon kindle voyage is the absolute e reader to end all e reader light amazing screen and stylish minimal design if you want an e reader definitely buy this one
with my love of turning paper page in a book and not being a techie i held off rushing into buying one of the many tablet reader available i spent quite a bit of time reading review and talking to others before making my decision and i am so glad i did my research what i like most about the kindle paperwhite the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eye whether i am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside the ease of syncing it with my mputer and wifi the speed of downloading a book the ability to adjust the font size the ability to bookmark and pick up from where i stopped reading and the size and weight which make it very portable i opted for an envelop style sleeve for storage rather than a ver you might use for an ipad or similar tablet it is easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading i am thrilled with this device and give it two thumb up for me there is no substitution for the feel of real paper but this reader me close
the kindle paper white is lightweight easy to use work great outside love reading at night with the built in lighted screen too love how you can adjust the size of the print so easily too

it is a positive addition to the household i enjoy having alexa
i bought this for my child and she love it it doe everything she want it to do and more
my daughter gave me a google for christmas but i returned it because i wanted an echo love it
i really enjoy the echo i got an echo dot and liked it so much i then got the full size echo i originally go the echo dot for the novelty thinking i would not really use it very much but it turn out that i use them all the time it is not something that anyone really need but it is handy and a lot of fun some of the thing it doe really well it is great at voice regnition you seldom have to repeat yourself setting timer reminder and alarm is a easy a saying alexa wake me at am or alexa tell me when minute is up if you are a prime member the echo is great at playing music from your music library or from prime music it is also great at playing radio station using tune in and other apps in the morning i ll say alexa play wrko to listen to kim and vb on the radio some of the thing the echo is bad at it is well known that it u microsoft is bing search engine so most anything the echo ha to search for me back with the response i do not know that being able to tell the echo to use yahoo or google would make this a five star rating also if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you for example if i m in the upstairs bedroom location of the echo dot and say remind me to call john smith in minute and then i go downstairs to the kitchen location of the echo the reminder will only be in the bedroom it would be nice if i uld have an alarm or reminder set on both device the echo dot ha the same capability a the full size echo a far a i cannotell the only difference is the full size echo ha much better sound for music that being said the echo dot still sound great amazing really for such a small device but the full size echo is like listening to a stereo again these are well made device and are a lot of fun and very useful maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun nversation piece with guest or grandkids me around
i really like this product and have remmended it to others great buy for the price
this is my nd kindle and would not go without one for any length of time great to bring along on a trip and easy for anyone to use
i use my fire every day i m very satisfied with it is performance and size the battery last a long time so i can use the kindle for hour without recharging

i am very happy with my kindle excellent useful
a a gift for a friend it work very well for the untries which have rresponding amazon service such a china
the system is a little slow and then if you get the one with the offer they slow down your reading a bit but you cannot beat the price this is not a full tablet it an e reader with a lot of enhanced function
let is be perfectly clear this is not an ipad but for this fire is a steal i m very happy with this purchase
you will not regret this purchase the kindle hold a charge for more than a week is super light weight easy on the eye and allows you to define word with the point of a finger it even add defined word to a vocabulary list so you can review them â â â â â
ton of movie and all the sport you want no more cable
the unit itself is very simple to use somewhat difficult to get connected at startup but once setup ran flawlessly memory a little small
i baught thus tablet a an e reader for that purpose it work great it is also very good for watching streaming video
i love my kindle silk is a fast and easy way to access the webi can read book on my kindle anywhere once i download them to my kindle i have over book on the cloud it hold a charge for day when idle downside hard to read outside due to glare
good tablet for my grand kid had to replace defective one but otherwise great gorgeous his use
purchased for kodi and st time setup wa little bit time taking process after that everything good getting k resolution and flexible to carry anywhere buffering is good when you connected through internet cable instead of wifi
this is a great kindle it is decent sized for reading and watching video it ha an sd slot to add more storage so if all the internal memory is used all you have to do is add an sd card and you re good to go i would definitely remmend this kindle
nice packaging easy setup great for a middle schooler
the echo and alexa are fun to use nvenient and way more useful than i thought initially she is the best roommate ever she doe whatever i ask and doe not mplain about my choice of music
i bought this kindle for my dad the size is just perfect not too big nor too small and light to carry around
had the echo dot and it wa time to upgrade the sound on the echo is fantastic i use it to check weather wake me in the morning ntrol my philip hue light nest thermostat and of urse listen to music
got this for my father but added a gb drive so he can have more storage love the idea that you can do that wish apple would do the same
doe everything i need and ha a long battery life
skeptical at first did a lot of research wa a vanity purchase that ha turned into one of the most function home device i own timer in the kitchen done quick weather check done order something from amazon done throwing a party need tune great speaker done alexa will ntinue to get better the echo get smarter a you use it
hard to say anything wrong about this product work great
i enjoy reading but i wa not sure if i wanted to read with the aid of electricity turn out to not be dat bad
this purchase wa a no brainer the kindle paper white is all you need for an e reader plus with amazon you have an opportunity for many free e book
got alexa for christmas and love it great fun to ask question but also good for music listening to book and ordering from amazon have not set it up to ntrol anything in the house but am investigating it great buy and definitely recmmend
it work fine it is a charger
it is work very well for a child got for my year old she love it

bought a gift excellent purchase would buy more
my daughter love the game video that she can watch on it during the day and my wife u it to read on during the evening this thing get used a lot uld not be happier with this purchase
my nephew always u my sister is iphone when watching video he love his youtube video lol so i went out and bought him this the kid love it there is value in the cartoon membership also
having fun with it would tell a friend to try this one great sound
this is the one to get after amazon is update to have the device always on it also ha the best speaker of the three
nice tablet with all the basic feature needed for the daily use
i chose this to check email and facebook because i do not have a smartphone it is a lot quicker than getting on my laptop i use it for youtube and pandora also my only mplaint is my old eye struggle with the smaller print i am pleased with it
love this voice activated device great sound for a single speaker
switched from appletv to fire tv and absolutely love it speedy lot of capability due to android o
purchased this orange kindle a a gift for my niece after having one for my kid for a year it run great and at that price there are no mplains
it help if your an amazon prime member you can download a lot more thing to do on the tablet
so far the yo love it i thought it would be too much but no
bought two a gift to kid they love it very much
the thing that you can do with the amazon echo are amazing
the echo work great around the house from setting timer to listening to music to reordering paper towel
not only doe it play music you can shop create a shopping list hear joke get the weather anywhere in the untry and order food for delivery plus it keep learning
i love it perfect size to carry with me in my purse
interface with my arlo system tp link system and others via iftt improving nversational capability which is a plus so you do not have to remember specific skill looking forward to true artificial intelligence capability
easy to use and navigate great for watching movie and video
my child love this table great quality of picture excellent camera
once u get her updated and on track she is ok you download the app and away she go
i got this for my mom for christmas every time i visit she show me something else she can do with it i m so jealous i hope i get one
i m ambivalent about this tablet it is a great price point and the picture quality is amazing it is great for watching netflix but you are locked in to only the apps available on amazon i cannot download my browser if choice or even the google search app additionally the tablet is linked to amazon and basically unusable if you do not have a valid amazon acunt i bought an additional tablet for a non amazon person and they uld not download any apps
setup for the amazon fire tv box wa very easy i wa surprised at how little the box actually wa and just how powerful some of the apps and downloadable game were that you can use on the amazon fire tv i ended up ordering the amazon fire tv game ntroller online at amazon i am currently not an amazon prime member but may re nsider that decision in time to get even more functionality out of the box for anyone looking to buy a relatively cheap device to maximize their tv watching and even nsole game playing look no further than the amazon fire tv although it doe not mpare to a playstation iv or x box it doe have decent graphic on some of the available game i had also purchased a class gb micro sd card for the amazon fire tv box a well and had no trouble formatting it and getting it setup
amazon echo is a smart home device but it is not quite a smart a google home it also doe not integrate with your smartphone a anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker i do not care about ordering product from amazon using my voice and i wish alexa would answer my more obscure question like google doe where the echo shine right now though is with smart home integration i use the echo to ntrol my philip hue light and ntrol all of my home theater device through my harmony hub and soon full ntrol over my dish hopper through a dish amazon partnership it is a bit more expensive than i would have liked and i ended up adding an echo dot to the other room so i didnhave to yell for alexa to hear me in hindsight if you do not need a mediocre bluetooth speaker get the echo dot instead which you can hook to speaker of your own choice
amazing sound all around great product nothing negative so far
great new device for the whole family we added hue light and nest camera
bought this kindle for our grandchild and he love it for anyone who just love to read this size and weight is perfect
great product this is my nd one my first one wa stolen it is very user friendly
the only downside of it is that you cannot have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android o
great product the firetv is very easy to use but requires the user to setup an amazon acunt this can be a free or prime acunt the firetv easily connects to your wifi giving you access to addons game music movie etc the voice ntrolled remote ntrol make searching for your favorite ntent easy but if you prefer you can use the navigation feature instead parental ntrols are provided if needed there is also a video you can watch that show a sample of the feature this devise offer great purchase i even took camping using my phone a a hot spot powered by a generator the firetv worked perfectly
i really enjoy my amazon it is getting easyer to use and i am finding new apps every day
this little speaker is way better that her mother after that update making it hand free i remmend to anyone
very nice tablet easy to use screen is very bright and clear nice tablet for the money
alexa thats all you need the voice mmand is amazing looking for show or browsing
perfect i love it glad i did my homework before purchasing best choice for a reader
amazon fire tv is good overall need little more option like casting from phone and laptop and need to improve little bug in software to get better interaction and performance
bought this for my year old mother she love it
this is a great item is not just smart is so easy to work and do small thing for you
the kindle paperwhite is lightweight and simple to use i love my kindle it look just like i m reading a regular book but i do not have to worry about flipping page i just slide my finger or tap
kid love it no real issue solid tablet for the value
should have been included with the e reader
good tablet fir child and up especially when you go on a vacation long plane or train ride
absolutely love it so lightweight and nvenient to take on the go
the new kindle fire hd is good and my son love it
i found that i wa immediately sked by a staff member if i needed help i received good advice and shown similar alternative product what i bought wa perfect for what i wanted the price wa quite reasonable
two different friend household told u how much they ejoy the echo so we purchased ours it is fun to use near our mputer and we love it we are telling other friend about our experience
bought this for my son to enurage his reading and very pleased with this device i have sideloaded the ability to rent library book and it work well he can read easily without tiring his eye or needing to go to library frequently since i have to drive him everywhere it helped both of u i wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically
this is a good item for reading book it is easy to use
my year old love it good ntrol option just need to figure out how to get the web browser on her side
bought this for my nephew for christmas he love it and is nstantly on it mostly playing game

my son love it is on it all the time love all the game always trying to download all thing all the time
the product work great a of now it arrived a promised
decent tablet for the price enomic tablet for easy browsing
my wife ha enjoyed this tablet a lot she play a lot of card game and look up recipe
bought a a gift for my mom she is so happy therefore i m happy
great price good alternative to downsizing cable package
just writing this review to get my point this wa a gift for my mother i think she like it fine
i love using my kindle fire for reading book from amazon m
the tablet work just like my laptop quick fast
so easy to use and entertaining i love this product
i bought one a month ago for my year old granddaughter a she is always on mine so i gave this one to her year old brother for his birthday this month love the kindles
best product for reading i am using since one and half year
great size to take everywhere and super fast good battery life
having realistic expectation is a must with the echo i had thought the ai would be much better than it is sometimes you need to say something three time for alexa to find it for example if you ask her to play a specific song by a specific artist the first two time she will say there is no song by that particular artist but on the third attempt she find it this is with voice training mplete mind you i purchased three echo to use a a starter system to play music on each floor of my house they did not support whole house play at first but due to high demand they now have a group setting so you can play music simultaneously on all your echo be warned though if you ask alexa to play your group multiple echo you cannot play all your devise at once using spotify for example verbally asking alexa to play the entire group only allows play from amazon music the alexa app need some work but is fairly easy to navigate i feel im pretty tech savvy so for those who arent just take some time to browse through the app on your phone you need to enable skill in order to get response to certain question which to me is a big draw back i think most have the intention of buying the echo setting it up and asking it anything and getting a response without all the extra setup remembering specific phrase to get an exact response can be a bit of a hassle i gave it four star because it work for playing most music through my whole house without breaking the bank i think there is still a lot of improvement that uld be made and it seems amazon priority isnt necessarily the echo from review ive read the request to play music on multiple device wa something people were asking for since the product release i wa able to pick them up when they were in sale but to be honest if i would have paid full price i would have returned all three and saved my money wait until they go on sale and then you can justify some of the shortfall of the product
i got this for my husband birthday it is fun we mostly use it to listen to music because it make it so easy to find an artist i wish i uld change her name to anything i want
i got the kindle fire hd for my daughter for christmas and she love it very much
bought for my year old son for christmas he like the amazon fire and using frequently primarily for playing game my husband ha had one for several year and u it every day
i love this little device it is perfect for reading anywhere and anytime especially great to use in the dark after my hubby is asleep most back lit device hurt my eye by this one doe not bother them at all
i bought a gift but i had a chance to use one of them and it is great probably a good if not better than apple tv and i currently have an apple tv in my house the music app alone is worth the price and the set up wa very easy i am seriously thinking about getting one for my bedroom it doe not me with he hdmi cable and that would be an extra maybe cheaper depending where and the length you get but it is still cheaper than an apple tv
i went from the inch kindle to the and it really made a difference easier to read and clearer than my old one
i highly remmend kindles i would not own anything else i love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading this ha wifi capability i would highly remmend this item
cannot go wrong great for game wifi great overall very happy
really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading book whilst traveling overseas seems to be ok so far battery life seems good relatively simple to operate nice clear screen my wife bought a nook at the same time and i have to say downloading book for that seems far easier and le mplicated than the kindle fire
my son absolutely love this tablet he ha dropped it a lot and ha not cracked it yet but even if he did amazon would replace it for up to two year for free i also like the prime acunt for the kid to be able to play whatever apps for free
we have this and the echo we love them my grandchild have fun asking question
the tablet is not incredibly easy to use and to load stuff onto
great value for the pricing black friday special
i like the kindle fire but is lacking on instruction hard to figure out how to use the feature definitely need a stylus tool to use
this is a vvery good device that serf it purpose extremely well and a at aprice thats afforadable and well worth it i would remend it to friend and family
my year old grandson navigates on the tablet with ease he is even taught me some thing
i use alexa for fun fact listening to music and telling weather i also use it to turn on and off some wemo light i installed i bought this one a a gift for a close friend and she love it too
i love this tablet i purchased of them one did have to be returned because it had a short in the charge plug but a simple exchange and the new one wa good i still gave this star because for buck it is still working month later after some abuse by u being careless doesnt scratch easy would be perfect for kid too
the kid love it they learn something every day i m happy i bought it
this wa a gift for christmas we bought this on a black friday sale price wa reasonable
charged phone well and fast no mplaints a of yet
for the money this is an exceptional value not the best tablet out there but it is the best for the money
i bought this speaker after looking at other speaker from bose and beat i purchased this one because it had great sound but also because it wa cheaper than mpetitors and had many additional capability via alexa voice ntrol i love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming service via voice it is great than i can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change song playlist volume etc the alexa voice regnition work very well it seems to be more accurate than siri i frequently ask alexa what song is playing i also ask alexa to search for certain song that i want to hear if not in my library it will play from prime music similar to the way apple music function additional voice feature i use are news report weather forecast and ntrol of wemo switch in my home overall a great buy
my three year old son love it he can read and learn so much from the free time app
one of my major issue with e book l is using screen and the annoying glare while the paper white still is not a printed page it doe a good job of getting close with the backlight optional it retains the benefit of being able to read at night too i love my ipad but prefer the kindle paperwhite for all my e book
love it it allows me to charge it without having to plug it to a mputer
i love this tablet i store all my kindle book on it i also set it up for my year old grandson to play on it
love the kindle fire i m on my th one and that is due to my clumsiness and knack of losing thing i have had one kindle fire but i much prefer the is due to smaller size and just seem to work smoother im totally lost without it
seems to do all that it say it can do and is durable
great tablet fast reliable only downfall is having to pay to remove add
my husband wanted this for father day so i got it for him he love it and i do too we get the temperature and forecast each morning set timer for our grandkids playing on electronics set alarm play music and the grandkids get alexa to tell them joke it is amazing and we talk to her all day the technology is so outstanding
is it operate my wife love it my granddaughter know how to operate a good sounding bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tell knock knock joke in make my granddaughter crack up that make it worth every penny i paid useful to remmend to anybody
bought for our grand kid great price and very good graphic
very nice thanks best buy very fast and very good price
loved the original kindle but after dark i needed a light source with the paperwhite and the adjustable back light it is so easy to read anywhere any time the variable font help when i get tired and need to increase the size of the font for easier reading i would happily remmend this kindle paperwhite to all
i decided to buy this for my mom for christmas and she love it she u it daily and had no problem setting it up by herself for someone who suck with technology she ha no problem with this tablet and it is a nice size
great sound and pretty user friendly doe not do exactly what i thought it did
they keep busy lot of kid apps to view entertainig
i bought this because i recently signed up for amazon prime and wanted to take advantage of the free book nice tablet
it meet my expectation speed storage efficiency and effective reliable
i use this to have many tv running at the same time without having to pay for cable
the screen is too dark and cannot adjust the brightness
great case ok tablet no android play store weak micro usb port it is is not an straight out the box tablet had to install android play store on it and a far a the charging port go i m on my rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy
i have one of these already i bought this one for my usin for christmas she love it is now able to watch netflix and the like without having to fight her daughter and husband for the tv
excellent product it wa very easy to install mpatible to all of our electronic equipment very user friendly â love that it it ha the voice feature on the remote
easy to use simple set up i d remmend it to anyone
this is a good tablet next time i buy a tablet i will get a bigger one it doe all we need it to great for kid
bought this in thanksgiving sale it is a great loss price tablet at the sale price but would not buy it for regular price would go for hd model instead by playing a bit extra though
the tablet is great for reading and watching movie
kindle fire is a dream larger screen easy to read
easy to set up and easy to use and the speaker sound amazing
i purchased the amazon echo and the harmony elite remote ntrol a part of my new automated smart home device i love being able to ntrol my tv and entertainment system simply by saying alexa however it is my opinion that these system are not mpletely bug free and will probably be improved over time in addition setting up amazon echo can be time nsuming if you are not technologically inclined overall the amazon echo is smart home dream me true
overall this device is great no problem with performance and usage my only fault i think they can advance on is the remote the current one is nice and sleek but lack the ability to type hitting the arrow key to search for anything is a pin send i would add the ability to search for apps a little more easily finally the web browsing is not the best and definitely need advanced on
this kindle voyage is replacing an older kindle from year ago and what an awesome upgrade it is faster ha a very useful backlight still very easy to use and so light
the new fire hd tablet is a great purchase for the price it is fast enough for basic browsing and you can download prime video to watch on the go which is why i bought it
good for the kid and it work for playing game and reading exactly what i needed it for very happy
the kindle e reader are the best on the market while this one doe not include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version
after about two week i ended up returning this item it nstantly froze and when it wa working it wa no faster than my fire stick the voice search wa a joke i m pretty tied in to the amazon esystem i love my echo but i wa disappointed with this device and for a hundred dollar no thanks
added more memory downloaded movie and show to the fire and went on vacation it wa perfect also found out you can download amazon prime movie to watch offline that is awesome for travel
omg i am so enjoying this sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doe not require plug or wire saw it online deal of the day read the review and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet best buy play it now everyday
this is a lot of fun to work with also i m still learning different thing she can do love being able to turn light on with my voice just amazing
got this around black friday for a great price been happy with it and will be buying my son one a well
great for use with the family and it is hard to figure out everything it doe
great for my mom who is not tech savvy luv it
it is absolutely perfect for my need i liked it so much i bought a send one
the echo is the best music player in the house hand down
so far so good it is been about week or longer since i got it i use it more than i thought i would a good reason to justify the for the amazon prime subscription
doe exactly what you wanted to very nice looking seems to be a solid product
bought of these so far and they work great for the price buy a mini sd card with it because it only ha gb onboard this tablet is a good buy for your kid and you can enable parental ntrols if you choose to do so i would remmend this tablet a a good buy it is not the fastest thing around but it get the job done at dollar you can break it and not care lol
so glad i bought this nice to have my book right there so easy to go from one to another in a series
great speaker and very useful around the house take advantage
a great streaming device that i use on a daily basis
bought for my parent fur christmas they live them very simple and easy to use
the paper white feel kinda like real paper the page is clear and bright i love to read at night it is awesome
the fire tv system wa very easy to set up and use we love the voice function
do not know whether i will ever get used to talking to my electronic device but when paired with a mpatible remote ntrol this thing can just about ntril everything in your house
so far my amazon purchase have been great and easy to use
love this kindle the press side page turner is great
this is good item to watch program with out all expense
i m very pleased with my fire tv purchase it wa highly remmended and it indefinitely delivers so many tv show and movie are available now to find the time to watch them all
i bought this around black friday for hoping it would be awesome it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro sd card none of which were regnized and yes i formated them with every format i uld think of fat ntfs fat xfat i even tried to have the tablet do it didnt work to make matter worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet ha it own app store which is missing many mmon apps the main reason i bought this wa to play clash of clan and i cant because it wa not on the app store i tried to also use aftermarket play store to play c but it didnt work launched and played time but didnt work or update after that needle to say i returned it and bought a samsung galaxy tab a version with is pen and it wayyyyy better bottom line you get what you pay for also hint the is pen version ha an extra gb of ram over the non pen version so you should get that if you can afford the extra
this unit is so much better then the first gen faster and star

we re an unplugged family multiple device kindles ipads roku etc so we re pretty familiar with this sort of tech fire tv work okay but the remote ha started giving me problem and we have only had the product for about month our roku which we have had for over a year is much smoother and ha not given u any problem we also use a chromecast which also seems to be le quirky than the firetv i have a p in the same room a the firetv and i find myself going to the p when the firetv start to annoy unless you re looking for a device that can also run kodi i d strongly remmend the roku over the firetv
listens to my request listen to pandora read me joke answer my question
i have had a previous kindle before and so i already knew what to expect getting text is clear and the back lighting make it crisper depending on the lighting of the room you are reading in in the dark if i put the backlight on it is possible to read but personally it hurt my eye so i bought a separate led clip on book light i use amazon all the time so it is the mpany i prefer to buy ebooks from
so fun and useful we play with it and rely several task with it
being able to sign in and not have to do any setting up make this device super user friendly
i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best the screen wa already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed physical page turn button are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type they didninclude the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i do not think i ll miss it much a i wa always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anyway but this device made me smile a soon a i held it for the first time because it ha a larger bezel that you can really grip mfortably without touching the screen maybe this is not a big deal for most but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this device the other thing i wa hoping for wa the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device doe that and even better because it is software nfigurable the ver is very small and light and doe not add much bulk like the voyage origami case doe the only downside is that it doe not work a a hand free stand for reading i still wish it wa waterproof
this is an upgrade tablet from my first kindle fire that i purchased year ago love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads the great hd visuals and most importantly all of my previous picture and music file were easily transferred accessed by this new device love that this fire ha a front and rear camer too my old fire only had a front facing camera granted this is not an ipad but i do not want or need all an ipad doe and i definitely do not want to spend hundred of dollar on a device just because it is ol my fire tablet doe everything i need or want and it sted under i am one satisfied and pleased customer
great item for watching all new and old movie and or tv show
the charging plug on these kindle damage way to easy i am very disappointed a this is not the first time this ha happened to one of my kindles
i purchased the item for and wa shocked when i began using it that the battery lasted hour with moderate use came with month of free newspaper subscription and wa preloaded with a lot of feature it not the fastest in the world and i would prefer more storage but for the price and nsidering how well it work i m giving it star
this wa a gift for my daughter it is easy to use and can do a lot
these kindlewhites are awesome never thought i d give up holding a real book but the white are just too nvenient
love this base for charging my kindle you still need to use a good rd for most effective charge with a good rd and this base your kindle will charge in under minute
you can absolutely not beat a kindle fire unless you are my year old son haha but seriously at the price and the beating they take they are worth it every time and with the cloud storage i do not even mind having to replace it every year
this little device is great for it price lot of feature
this thing is the olest thing time play with love it
set up wa automatic i really didnneed to know anything specific just follow the prompt really great for my kid
i got this to try out cutting the cable being an amazon prime member i knew that i had some ntent already available but there are so many option when you get to looking i really like the ethernet port that i can hard wire from my modem to make sure that i am running at max speed
limited use if you dont want to enroll with amazon
excellent tablet for work very well surprise me when found it have bluethoot to connect with my sound dock
i love the echo a you can do many ol thing with it
bought this for my son it is been through some stuff and still going strong

tap is a nice bluetooth wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it question can sync with your phone via using the amazon alexa app
we love this speaker for listening to music the weather news or just anything it is super portable and even ha a hand free option so it is really like a mini echo
this actually wa a christmas present for my mother but i had to set it up this is a nice upgrade from her kindle purchased three year ago kindle wa great assisting getting it registered since neither of u uld remember her password
i went from a paper white to the kindle fire and it is been great it is easy to use and to read my book lot of stuff you can do with this from watching movie to taking care of my email and facebook etc all round easy to handle and is a nice mputer tablet in the palm of my hand i like the way the ntrols are at the top so i do not accidentally turn the power off in the middle of something when i wa using other device that had the on off button at the bottom i just wish the power reserve would last a long a my kindle paper white the battery run down fester than i d like
i love it my amazon fire tablet it is great for kid to
i purchased three of these tablet to give away at work so while i do not have any firsthand experience i have asked my team how they liked them it u the amazon app store of urse which is fine but doe not even mpare to the google play store even though there are a lot of option and most big apps netflix hulu etc are all supported there is also removable storage it is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory this is a feature a lot of tablet stopped offering all in all these tablet are in expensive but more reliable and sturdy than other knock off tablet from different brand amazon made a great bargain tablet
this is my first e reader i uldnt be happier

it is very nvenient while working out traveling and stuff the mic is at the right location and it is good to answer call a well i have connected it to my iphone and use it to listen to music and take call the best part is even if you do not want to plug it in your ear you can leave it hanging around your neck
tablet is good for all around use my kid use most and like to buy music and book through amazon
purchased of these for the kid for christmas and had to me back and get one for myself a well awesome product
it is easy to use and carry while traveling the battery charge is good for a week that is also great
i bought the amazon stick a a bday gift for my usin it is pretty easy to use with it plug and play feature
this is a very good tablet for a first time user or a young child the software is easy to use and the camera work great
this is my third kindle and i am thrilled with the new display money well spent
easy to use for book and audio will use on vacation
this wa supposed to be a gift for christmas but after i bought it i had to keep it for myself
i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd
this is my send purchase of a kindle fire an upgrade from the original which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user it is an excellent device with significant improvement over the original my only issue is that a particular app that i routinely used apparently wa only available on the original and is not available on the latest model
i started with the little brother and liked it a lot so i decided to upgrade to the larger model i use it primarily a an e reader and for some net surfing and facebook the wifi work great and is ready to access and use do not buy this unit if you want cell g access to the internet it is wifi only frankly my cell phone take better picture but that is not what i really wanted from the unit all in all a great reader with excellent battery life
the tablet is very user friendly for my mom who is not very mputer savvy
kid love their table we bought two and the warrenty wa great when the rd broke on one
it worth to buy this table for the price elegant design and response feel better than samsung tab
dollar black friday day deal my nephew love it
bought online black friday to avoid in store hassle got an option on lors to keep my boy from nfusing tablet
i loved me previous kindle but always had to keep light on to read in the dark the backlight on this make it so much easier to read in the dark it is not too bright and battery go for about two week the resolution is higher too font look crisp and sharp
my wife i bought this a a gift for her son it is been a hit since day his entire family ha been enjoying alexa answering question getting weather forecast playing music i m buying one for myself
i can go in this place and spend hour best price and quality product
this is great it is pretty quick it work ha usb connection for data or for a mouse keyboard it is small strong and neat k is okay but still not a roku in term of screen quality in my opinion although fire is feel a little snappier le noisy and heat le than the roku i like it and will obviously keep it but star just because there is room to improve it to be a nicer k streamer
i have a kindle myself and love it so wanted to purchase one for my grandson is birthday he is yr old and he love it
i wa expecting an android device and disvered it wa an android like device my fault for not reading up on his device before hand i returned the amazon fire and bought a samsung tab e i probably would remmend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading
i bought of these my year old twin love them amazon ha a lot of free game that we have downloaded for them and they can watch amazon and netflix and i bought the kidproof case
love how this work year old get around great on her own
we have so much fun with the speaker can ask her anything
this is the send kid is version of the fire that i have purchased and i think it is a good deal since it is really for my kid to watch netflix i wa looking for a cheap option i thought about getting the option but i would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ad anyway so adding it up i feel like i didnspend much more than i wa going to anyway and i get the year warranty included not bad in my opinion and it doe a fine job with netflix streaming so far
if you like to read this is an excellent choice battery life is week even with the backlight in use ntrast is great both inside and in direct sunlight most municipal library have load of free book in the kindle format so the device effectively pay for itself in short order
when i first heard that amazon had released a budget tablet i wa skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed boy did i have the wrong assumption this product ha exceeded my expectation and then some the screen is responsive the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down it is just all out impressive front facing camera too is kind of ol although the quality is not a good a the camera that is in the back game play fine on this but you ll be wanting a memory card to store game on it game play fine depending on what you install on it but some game suffer minor framerate issue if too much is happening on the screen okay for the price and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablet
hand free operation at it is best i have my philip hue hooked up to it operating my kitchen and family room light a well a pandora iheartradio and my nest i have been using it for the past two week and i love it the only issue i have experienced so far ha been when i asked alexa to turn on my family room light only one of the two bulb turned on this however might be an issue with the philip hue hub other than that this ha worked out great

the nvience of the amazon echo is instantly noticable this is the first step i have taken towards building a smarter home and am loving it being able to grab information by just talking to this device is wonderful granted i do feel a little silly having her tell me joke whenever i am home alone but that aside this is a great device the echo can sync up with hue light nest thermastats etc and i cannot wait to try that out make sure to get geek squad protection yes it is a few more buck but why not protect your investment i m sure it ll me in handy when i need it too

i bought this for my sister last year and i had to buy for myself this year
super fast and good storage ol i wa able to iunstall kodi and easy access
i had a hard time trying to stream movie even with a good internet connection wa a little disappointed
for having a disunt for this price it wa a deal i uld not pa up even when everywhere seems to be sold out of this item i wa still able to find best buy mobile had them in stock make a great stocking stuff
i bought this for my son who is a product of the time and take very easily to electronics and touch screen device my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on at first i wa skeptical about spending the extra for the kid fire a i thought it wa mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silin when the tablet arrived in the mail i wa surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick heavy duty type of foam it provides a good enclosure for the kid to hang onto a well a a solid defender against any drop it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information you have the ability to set up both an acunt for adult and a child is acunt the child is acunt doe not have access to the app store or anything that you do not want them to get a hold of you can set time limit on their acunt to your desire you can allow and disallow any application you want to their acunt it me with a year subscription to amazon free time unlimited which i interpreted a basically prime for kid this allows access to all the apps and game a much a they want the kid user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate he is able to one click to any apps book game he want to use it also highlight your recently used apps in the carousel at the top overall i m very happy with the purchase of this tablet a it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal danger the internet hold if you re not careful
my wife love it play game with her all the time and show it of
this is the first time that i have used a kindle tablet i have used android and apple device before and this is a different beast people that are used to an android experience will not be thrilled with this device even though it look like android the play store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the kindle store if i had to do it all over again i d spend an extra or and get an actual android tablet

to me this is an amazing little device i suppose it is not very fast by modern standard downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable my home internet connection is not the greatest but the screen for it size is beautiful there are many game apps and book available for free i love my kindle fire it ha wonderful lean fast apps for accessing email and facebook the graphic on game amaze me if you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money i think this is a great choice i m nsidering getting one for my sister

i purchased for my year old daughter it a plus
i know not everyone want to read a direct mparison to an apple tv rather than a review on the moerits of this device but i have owned both and stuck with the apple tv instead of this the apps i used directv now netflix amazon prime video choked and buffered much more often or froze mpletely the wifi reception wa also sub par the remote is good and i prefer the battery approach to apple is rechargeable one everything else though the apple tv seemed to do better my two cent still a solid streaming device and the price is better than apple is i would make the decision based on how plugged into amazon is esystem you are v apple is
iam just in love with my amazon echo cam straight home and set it up acting with a wemo device i ourvsed to test out on a lamp i definitely remmend an amazon house it make everyday question so much simpliar
work well with all kindle model either a a mputer rd or charging rd my original kindle came with a charger and rd the new edition do not they me with a rd like this but my mom is got thrown away with the box this is a perfect replacement
enjoy the feature offered and it ability to integrate with other device will be an integral driver in the success of the smart home took a star away because of the sound solid overall but not pure quality
my brother in law and his family have enjoyed it very much he say finding song is better and faster than pandora

the fire tv work just like it is supposed to i got it mostly to watch cbs all access and it worked so well i purchased a send one week later for another tv
i want to rate it but best buy let me rate it or nothing in between similarly i see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a ppi display kindle paperwhite is good but not much ha changed over the year if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending a paperwhite with g go up towards usd i would rather invest the money on a tab if you are sticking with the base version a i brought usd no ad then it a good deal
amazon keep getting better tablet now ha option to move in set wallpaper and more with added sd card option is even better

excellent amazon fire hd for kid perfect for a holiday gift
love all the apps available more than any other streaming device by far with k ntent
lot of fun it play music game weather and so much more however when making a phone call or text message i hope they develop a way to determine who is able to send you a text message or phone call and make it so that you can call anyone you so choose in united state not just those that have the app or device i do feel that google may have a better device because they have more advanced database sometimes alexa doe not understand what you were asking and you would think she would be able to know it but it is fun however if i had to do it over again i would have probably purchased a google because i can just tell that it will probably be able to do more then just play music

i bought this tablet for my daughter and she love it
family of and now with alexa seriously she add another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility kid play game with her like is jeopardy riddle joke and daily easter egg while the adult like smart ncerts sport highlight news brief and all the thing your siri can do by more like turn on off your light ffee maker tv and whatever else you hook your smart outlet to sold separately now for the alexa bug more often than not we find ourselves repeating mmands attempted fix by using voice training multiple time in area we are most when aroud alexa saw minor improvement we also wish the mmand to increase or lower volume wa more efficient shouting alexa volume multiple time after a song you liked wa at volume or higher is annoying we have learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo i wa curious how alexa would respond to different voice pattern surprisingly once she hears her name and the mmand prompt she responds rrectly of the time my wife tell me i m cheating on siri and rtana a alexa ha quickly won my heart and my kid a well we re glad we went with this not the dot or google home if you plan on making voice purchase a mmercials advertise careful your kid might order lb of okie dough a alexa doe not regnize who is voice is ordering it overall the gimmick wear off but we routinely enjoy smart ncerts and our smart light system soon we will be asking these robot to do our dish laundry ok or whatever else human do not feel like doing hopefully i see this unfold in my lifetime brunsch
everyone ha enjoyed this item great fun for the whole family
i wa impressed with the voyage overall i especially like the light sensor feature because it make reading enjoyable in all setting
this device is excellent picture and sound would remmend
i got this for my son so i can read him book and he can play a few game it is easy to use and i like how you can setup for it to work kid mode
wish it regnize other language other than english and ha a kid is mode
this fire tv work great i would remmend having amazon prime video and netflix also if you know anything about kodi you should definitely add that
this tablet wa a gift for a child and they absolutely love it
there is nothing better than a paperwhite for reading and the new one is just great clear clean and quick
bought of these black friday for my kid they seem to be doing good so far hopefully they last
important update a you read my original review please be aware that amazon announced in early february a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owner to enable a hand free option by going into setting in the alexa app you can now choose the hand free option and have your tap respond to voice mmands without touching it just like the echo and echo dot this is a fabulous development and something tap owner have been hoping for thank you amazon since the lack of hand free operation wa the one major shortming of the tap this wonderful little device ha now gotten a whole lot better one thing to keep in mind though especially if you use your tap on battery power the hand free mode will drain the battery more quickly because it requires the microphone to be on at all time but since you can easily toggle between hand free or regular tap mode using the alexa app you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and nvenience i admit that i wa a little skeptical when amazon first introduced it echo device but i decided to buy one anyway thinking that if i didnlike it i uld easily sell it after all back in the early day of the echo it wa in very high demand so the financial risk associated with trying it wa minimal today a an avid music listener who love to ok i m thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try i had wanted a device that i uld stream music with in the kitchen and the echo hand free voice ntrol made it very appealing but how would it sound that question wa quickly answered a soon a i set up and started using my echo read more
it work pretty goodwork properly with the right internet speed
the future is here the best voice regnition i have ever used along with intelligence and responsiveness
i really like the fire tablet but there are some issue to be aware of amazon seems to subsidize the low st of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ad and and use their apps every time you activate it the screen display is a full size ad that go away when you swipe the screen there is no google play so you can only download apps chosen by amazon at their appstore otherwise pretty ol for the money
the echo is great it can run smart home product and play music
it is a kindle great kindle for a great price expandable memory can be used to expand your movie or game library it also ha great sound and picture quality
i bought this item for my husband for christmas we were wondering if he would really like it a he usually just like to read actual book but he immediately loved it it is very user friendly and he ha enjoyed getting to know all the in and out of it it is a great way to read a book but it ha so many other u too i m very glad i purchased this item it is proven to be an excellent purchase
quality of kindle is pretty okay just wish charge would last more than hour when child is playing game after being fully charged
the price is something you cannot beat but it can be misleading pretty much every function and app required you to buy something not much you can do for free but still worth it for such low price
do not expect top of the line performance from this dollar unit but it ha really nice picture ok sound and good battery life shortmings would be small memory causing laggy performance at time unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory
i would definitely buy it again but it doe not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage doe to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun for a product of this price it should not be missing any feature otherwise it is great light and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp
got this for my wife for christmas and she love it she ha the ipad but this kindle fire hd is so much easier to use for book and the occasional solitaire game i am glad i bought the mb a i would rather have too much storage space than not enough great product and very easy to read book on
love being able to tell what i need on my shopping list
best investment in a tablet ever it take good video which i used a lot for my sister mpetitions cannotype a paper light and easy to use purchased all my school text book on here instead of carrying pound battery last and good to watch movie on absolutely love it add a memory card to it and you ll be able to use it for whatever and wherever
this is a must have for the kindle great quality texture
overall this is a great tablet for the money it doe exactly what you need it to do if you looking for a tablet to search the web or just do basic thing this is the tablet that you should get
out of all thats offered out there this is my favorite it help if you re a prime member and kodi run well on this device
i have done everything with alexa from pandora the nest thermostat and iheart getting one more for when we go to el salvador
my daughter love her tablet amazon ha plenty of game for her to play it is also easy for her to use
much faster and stronger signal than fire stick which i also love and is on my other tv
this is a great tablet for young kid it wa very inexpensive which is the main reason i got it kid are usually clumsy it ha most of the apps that the other service provide
i have not been able to use it a lot yet for now only use for music
bought these for my kid for the holiday no you tube app installed so you have to find a rd party substitute ad pop up all the time with an option to remove them for amazon state that since i purchased the tablet on sale for this is how they can afford to mpensate for that revenue i would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt maybe a good product but not for u
it is worth the the amazon app store ha a lot of potential the ui is kinda like android but not a refined i m satisfied with the tablet
bought this device for my living room tv set up best idea ever
i thought it would do more eg be able to integrate with my cell phone to make call or send text message
kid love it doe the job of an ipad but st way le
great product would remmend it if you need a low budget tablet
i bought this tablet to watch my rerded tv show while i am at quilt retreat i also can watch netflix and amazon prime i like that is take a micro sd card picture and sound are very good
echo ha been a great hit with my child a well a my self ordering is so simple it is saving me time
the amazon echo wa remmended by our it department at work and is easy to use alexa is smart and usually right highly remmended
my kid had neither one had a reader or a tablet before this ha been a good choice for them
good device use it often wish i would have waited for a sale otherwise work well i have been using this more and more especially given the rising sts of cable if you can wait until the next day to catch your show and have an hd antenna you can say bye bye to cable bill minus the internet of urse love what you can do with this with the included remote if you have an alexa home system set up with hub the voice remote can be used to ntrol alexa if you re looking for a cheaper version the stick will work but if you game at all this is your best bet especially with the quicker processor
it work well in our house can hear my voice from pretty far away doe what you want and more
i picked this up on black friday when it wa it seemed like the parental ntrols would make it good for my kid i m not sold while i can sideload the google play store you cannot access anything you download from the safety of the child is acunt in addition gb is practically useless
i am a flight attendant and i love this small sleek book it is a must have the only thing i would change is i would add audio
great streaming box for watching great movie amazon tv is fast and fluid to use they have alot of movie
i have a few amazon echo and echo dot but there are a uple of spot in my house where the original black echo looked out of place and the white echo look great work perfectly just like the black version
i should have bought the echo when it wa released i wa skeptical a to it value in my home a friend had a dot and liked it ok but didnt use it much after awhile i decided to try it for myself and bought a dot i liked it enough to buy a tap for bedroom i wa not to impressed with the audio so naturally i purchased the echo the dot is somewhere and i use the tap and echo every day timer news music weather spell something etc
the video quality on this is lacking mpared to other streaming device in the plus side you can use kodi i would get a roku if you do not plan on using kodi or a nividi shield if you plan on using kodi
but i do not know if it is worth the additional money and it doe not allow for aux output i have the full size in my bathroom were i do not have other speaker i use the dot with my sound system
it began with one now i have three i need two more but i think i will get dot i wanttry hooking it up to my darth vader bluetooth helmet that is going to be sweet i wonder if i can rename this from alexa to darth get this but realize you ll want many more
this is a great tablet for someone who read a lot though the battery uld use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious reader like me i read a ton so it doe not last very long other than that i m very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson cannot remember her name handled everything for me
i would have given star if it were notfor the charging port there is a small metal prong that line up with the cable that can get bent if you do not plug it in very carefully have had to send one back because it would no longer charge otherwise great tablet
brother in law love it he is not very technical so perfect for him
excellent medium streaming device uld easily take the place of about different box under your television
the size is perfect good resolution can be used for all purpose
got this for my year old granddaughter and she love it u it for game play homework etc mom and dad love the parental ntrols not having to worry so much

excellent for any book lover plus it is great for outdoor use a well a people who have a challenge with using an ipad type tablet due to the screen blink that cannot be noticed due to the speed but is a killer for the eye

the product is quite nifty i personally enjoy it i feel a though it brings everyone in the house together even if we are not in the same room
i bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke it wa easy to set up more importantly it is easy for her to understand i did have to create an amazon acunt for her just so i uld download her favorite apps the only challenge i had wa she u gmail for her email acunts it took me a uple of try to get her gmail into the stock email app so far she is happy a a lark with her new tablet

enjoyed the firesticks for a while but wa tired of how much buffering time it took because of wifi spending the extra to plug this directly into the modem wa well worth it have not had a buffering issue at all p full movie load and play in a matter of sends
i like it allot but the memory size is somewhat limiting i thought that i uld save and run apps from the sd card but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory also beware that android apps will not work on a kindle kindle fire apps need to be downloaded from amazon
the screen resolution ease of use and access to apps book and movie make the kindle fire hard to beat this is the th kindle we have purchased big family over the past several year have been happy with each one
good tablet for the price typically when you pay a small price for a tablet you get a piece of junk but not this tablet it great
for the money this tablet is an amazing piece of hardware well nstructed good fit and finish good battery life but putting non amazon software on the tablet is a pain a real pain i purchased this for my granddaughter and wanted two thing youtube and skype it took about hour to put these two apps on the tablet in the end i returned the tablet and purchased an insignia bb house brand tablet instead
this e reader is very excellent the screen is a bit small but you can acmmodate
so slow returning mine for something different any suggestion
i just needed something with a front facing camera to allow my grandmother to skype with my son on sale for a tablet that doe that and allows you to stream video steal technology is a trip
once connected to my wi fi it would not connect to daughter wi fi when i visited her the loading time for program is really slow oh well what did i expect for only
echo work really well but i only use it for music and news cannot really say a lot about the other function drawback is that it cannot answer a lot of question and unlike the google home it wonremember what i asked prior
i dearly love my alexa she is able to give me the latest weather update along with other very useful mmands plus she can make me laugh on a regular basis
very nice to have in the kitchen living room areaâ just ask what the weather isâ the timeâ play musicâ the newsâ turn light onâ work great
i bought this tablet a a christmas gift it is a great tablet for a great price
it wa to be a gift but not really liking it for myself but it is ok
great improvement over the old kindle fire better size than the hd not to big and not too small fast processing spead
im very happy with this purchase i got it on sale for and grabbed lol kid luv it
had trouble setting it up set it up using app on wife is phone it doe not work when wife is phone is out of the house grandkids have fun with it music speaker are good i have a lot to learn about this thing
amazon wonlet u download plant v zombie otherwise it is terrific
i purchased the kindle oasis because i wa growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my ipad so the portability is great and of urse i went for the most expensive because i wanted the extra battery life and while the length of time it stay charged is nice charge very quickly it is still overpriced i love the non glare screen you can literally read this anywhere but the wifi connectivity is patchy at best i have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the oasis to connect this is very annoying would not be a big deal if i only read from this one device but i read from another and picking up where i left off is a pain most time non of my issue are really a big deal but for i do not feel like i should have any issue
doe everything i need thank you alight small package easy to take anywhere
i bought it for my son who really love to read he is very happy with it it ha a nice design screen is very mfortable to look at and it is lightweight perfect for home use and travel
this wa the perfect gift for my grand kid they love it
my wife enjoys this product really like the grocery list feature
i bought this tablet for my kid and it is amazing they are always on u tube
got it for my husband he love it i wish i had gotten it for him sooner
great for young age and can be stored easily in school backpack
work great love the portability of book overall great product
my teenager love this and u it daily we have also took it place with u and the sound is great
we bought these knowing we had a uple of long plane ride ahead of u we have not regretted them one bit they are easy to use for the kid me with lot of fun apps game book best part for u wa being able to add a memory card so we uld add movie and a many apps a we needed without worrying about space
delivery great handling and use for those wanting a natural reading device instead of the glitter of some technology
i have not found anything i do not like about this it is just what i wa looking for
it is so fun to ask alexa and get an answer or listen to music which sound great by the way very glad i purchased an echo
alexa sits in my home office and play music for me throughout the day she is also quite helpful when my child ask me question that i do not have time to look up for them fun product easy information gathering
my grand daughter loved it she play with it all the time
work flawlessly once a strong wifi signal is established and love the ability to add arn tv british production
overall the amazon fire is easy to use i would remmend this device also best buy ha the best warranty policy
i really like the echo but be warned that you are still very dependent on your ipad to get the most out of your purchase especially a it relates to music
it protects my kindall and i cannotake it and put it in my purse if not get scratch because i like to read my kimball we have place waiting for people and it is a nice lor and it is very nice
searched around for the perfect tablet for my year old after testing tablet in store and reading review online the kid fire stood out the year warranty and free year access to kid ntent is amazing the soft foam case provides verage for drop the battery life is good for a few hour of play time and the charge time is quick after for the money this tablet cannot be beat only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with network at time but this is can be fixed by disncerting and rennecting to network overall this is a best buy for the money tablet can also be used for adult when you exit the free time app
the kindle paperwhite ha many improvement over my first kindle with a lighted touch screen wifi and ability to swipe to turn the page i love it
i had got this tablet for my niece for her bday and it is the best
great table for a gift easy to use a lot of aplication i will remmend
love my new kindle thought the screen would be too large but after using it a few day all is good very thin got a case for it i now feel at home with it do not like the new lock screen lock to open the tablet at all it tiny and hard to unlock most always taking several time to swipe it just right
the kindle paperwhits is great it hold a charge for two week or more which is awesome it is great to read in the sun and in darker area or at night because of the backlit screen like how small and mpact it is would def remmends getting one if you enjoy reading
simple tablet and i get along great i do not want to spend the big buck to get someting that a much cheaper alternative will handle just a well gave my much older tablet to a child who wa overjoyed and updated version for me
alexa is a wonderful mpanion and will never fail to impress your friend want to know the weather in texarkana or timbuktu no problem just ask her or how far is it from here to istanbul or indianapolis no sweat wanna hear some music just ask her to play the eagle or jackson brown iron maiden or frank sinatra it is easy and that is just scratching the surface
for the money best bang for your buck really great if you subscribe to amazon prime
ha great sound clarity alexia ha great response
we never put them down have lot of great game to play
i wa initially going to just get the amazon kindle but i thought this give me a tablet and a easy way to read book i buy e llege text it ha helped me so much i m so happy i invested my money in this
i m using it to keep track of my tool using the sail app it is great for this the only flaw i see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen my touch is much better i wa hoping to use the pen since when i access it i may have dirty finger after using my tool
i bought this for my spouse i already have one and know what to expect shop around for best price only black wa available but at least it wa in stock staff were helpful
i like the size it fit right in my pocket and it not bulky
great size clarity and many many apps game and book to keep the kid busy on those long car ride
the tablet is very helpful when using the internet

this is a good size tablet it is fast and responsive
i own a kindle fire and an ipad and i have a hard time reading them on the beach due to the glare this kindle reader is small enough to fit in your purse to take anywhere to read love it
the is bigger and lighter weight than my old and the battery life is longer it also ha more storage and a camera love it

this device helped in my decision to cut the rd work great abundant material to watch especially with prime
i love the fact it is a small unit take up almost no space and ha great feature
at first i bought this because i wa tired of carrying heavy okbooks but turn out it better suited for more novel type book i realized that okbooks need to be flippable where i can just sit and flip back and forth however this is great if you have long flight often light and easy on the eye i love being able to change the brightness easily
this wa a big help in cutting the cable rd it great saving money
i bought this just to listen to music with my daughter but i use so much more shopping list reminder timer etc i remmend anyone to get one
good and a lot of apps to pick from and can connect straight to internet
this is a great centerpiece for your smart home ha the ability to ntrol so many device with more ability ming also ha an impressive speaker for such a small device
it ha a multiple future for kid and parental ntrol that you can setup for your kid even you can ntrol usage of tablet for your kid
great for little kid who have a problem with breaking stuff
bought it for my son he wa very please with it
this product is similar to my old kindle however i wish the touch screen wa more responsive or it had manual page button on the side overall it is great
the kid absolutely love this tablet grabbed it while it wa on clearance and ordered kid proof case with them also it is been great for road trip and all
no mplaints work great and the battery is awesome a always
not a fancy a the ipad but a fraction of the st work well with android system and all apps like on our android phone cant beat the price
this tablet is well nstructed and light weight and is more than i expected the ereader part of it is the best for reading on a screen because of it blue screen feature
already had one echo and enjoyed it so much i uld not pa up getting another one at almost half price during best buy is amazon deal day
other than the fact that the set up for an iphone wa extremely exhausting and frustrating the device itself work great and is a lot of fun and helpful
it wa a gift for a friend and she love it would definitely remmend it
excellent tablet for the price we bought it a a child is tablet to surf and play game ha ton of free apps for kid
great sound in a small package for the money and i would buy again
good value for the price little bit heavy to carry
this tablet is great for minimal use for a child it is slow so i would not remmend it for an adult
i read a huge number of book in kindle format this kindle fire is perfect for that it is just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying it also is great for audible user you will want to install a micro sd card though you can also use it to watch netflix and the like although i do not a a tablet it leaf a lot to be desired if you are looking for a tablet give this a pa it ha a lot of system lag and wifi reception is terrible even in area where other device show a strong signal also you should know that you cannot access any apps on the google play store it is locked into amazon none of that bother me because like i said i only use it to read listen to kindle book and this device work perfectly for that bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality this will work well for you if you re looking for the full android tablet experience look elsewhere
fire stick from amazon very good product very nice
i love my kindle fire it is a big upgrade from the kindle keyboard that i used to have
tablet is modest for it is price good for beginner
alexa is very fun and entertaining we use her for our shopping list hearing the weather forecast and listening to our favorite music
quality wa good and the bluetooth worked ok but dinnected at time maybe because it wa not charged
it is a great tablet we use it alot when we travel
i bought this for my daughter and it wa worth it everything work well camera is good my daughter watch her show without problem
bought for adopted family for christmas they were happy
bought the fire tablet for our granddaughter she love it
great product wa able to use my sling acunt and access all my amazon show wa also user friendly very happy worth the cash especially now in k
first had the fire stick and i heard the box wa much faster i bought it and a soon a i plugged in and got started i wa able to see how fast and smooth it worked great product
cant say enough good thing about this product we also have the fire stick for other tv this sure doe beat paying for cable it is very easy to set up and use
best buy employee uld have been more knowledgeable on this item
great easy fluid tablet for begginers would highly recmmend excellent for all the reader out there too
this is a great entry level tablet for the casual user looking for simple web browsing email access and low resolution medium such a ebooks streaming movie and game the hardware feel sturdy in your hand and the display boast a scratch resistant surface a opposed to le durable product found in this price range it is not lightening fast but load and run most apps quickly and smoothly
happy with purchase would remmend to other people
great sounding bluetooth speaker and alexa is very helpful too
great product met all my expectation
i ordered several of these to send to family in haiti they were on sale
i have a kindle and wanted more option i love the bigger screen i find it easy to read it can have some reflection under light but not much
great gift for someone who ha everything very entertaining
not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the amazon program
great integration with harmony can buy stuff from amazon before i forget great product
the tablet a inch starter tablet is very durable excellent tablet for kidsvery tough good processing speed
got this because where i work we are not allowed anything with a camera this wa perfect can read for hour with little strain on my eye
i purchased it for a gift but i have to do all the up keep and maintaining i have been a long time prime member who ha many kindle book i see this can be good for reading out side it is lighter than a tablet and you do not have to charge it alot the battery last a long time setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it it display add while it off but it didnbother me at all it took me but a few minute to setup and learn how to use the device if you have prime you should see all your book right away but if you do not have prime but have someone in your house that doe you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she wa able to see all the book that i had purchased i can be selective after they are shared one thing i noticed wa there is the kindle lending library it only allows book to be borrowed per month recently amazon came up with prime reading so you cannotake out multiple book at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app which after they are taken out the kindle will see
product wa good for heavier than i expected i wa looking to replace an older kindle nothing fancy but adequate
love it good size for travel great feature no glare when using outside in the sun
for what this is it is great my year old love it you ll definitely need to get an sd card for additional storage but for the price it is so worth it would be much happier with her breaking this than an expensive tablet
i wa tired of the insane cable bill so i bought the fire tv goodbye cable fire tv meet all my need
i own a kindle hdx and wanted something small and portable wow is all i can say when i got my hand on the kindle oasis thank you babe the kindle oasis is very tiny portable fit in about anything from a jean back pocket to a very very small purse the clarity of the screen is awesome the touch of it work perfect very different than my hdx but i highly remmend it a little more pricey than the paperwhite but this one already me with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black brown and red red wa my choice which to me it is not red it is more of a wine red lor it is beautiful picture show my kindle oasis in the middle of the iphone plus left samsung is right so you can get an idea on the size it is super cute it is tinier than the kindle paperwhite
the kindle paperwhite is a wonderful option for traveling no weight lot of book and for senior who read large print book adjustable font size
just make sure you have the proper internet to make it work to it is full potential but if so the u are limitless and you can actually get rid of cable if you do it right
i bought this thing refurbished i find that i have to unplug plug back in the hdmi cable on a regular basis when switching input on the tv not sure if it is the amazon fire box itself or if it is the tv not likely otherwise it is a good device i bought it for the ability to hard wire my ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for k capability which it doe do having the alexa app is handy but her feature can be severely handicapped i probably should have just bought it new usually refurbished device work well a they are tested before resale and it wa probably tough to catch that the hdmi port on these might be finicky i may have to switch it out
preferred my old style and size because the new style did not fit withyour old case that wa new
very fast amazon stick replaced my apple tv also installed apps with ease
i bought this about week ago and i love it you can play game although a bit laggy watch movie tv show read and do quite a bit with it the price is amazing i would for sure buy this again and again i remmend this if you are wanting a tablet to read it is a great price for a pretty big screen but if you are wanting more of a game tablet i would remmend an ipad or whatever is at best buy that they remmend i definitely think there is enough gig for a few game and some book my rating is
great e reader would remmend this over the other kindles
nice e reader a bit smaller and definitely lighter than the paperwhite whiter screen still easy on the eye a bit expensive for just a reader however
kindle paperwhite strike a nice balance between feature and price amazon offer the best store for ebooks period if you are looking to bring your reading hobby to the st century you cannot go wrong
this is the best device for streaming very fast
great little streamer little to no buffering for amazon prime easy to load kodi for expanded fealtures
i got this for my two grandson age for christmas they love them
amazon product are always good a expected and i am totally satisfied with my purchase
a a google home user i wa excited to try it direct mpetitor amazon echo since a lot of people that i know have an echo and are enjoying theirs so far the setup process is very simple and requires you to download alexa app for your mobile device the alexa app definitely need more improvement a i found myself having to relaunch the app at time to rennect the echo to my wireless network alexa ha bluetooth connectivity which is great for streaming music from my iphone something google home doe not have currently the mic is very sensitive which i like so i do not have to speak too loudly to wake the echo up and it pick up voice from the far end of the living room the echo is located in the dining room sound quality is pretty good and music did not have too much distortion at higher volume the echo is is more on the heavier side which i like cause i feel the build quality is good the echo is tall so the tall black cylinder stand out in my dining room table i like the speaker and mic design volume ntrol can be adjusted by twisting the top upper ring which is simple enough amazon echo u bing for querying answer to your question and this is definitely where i think echo take a hit there were quite a few simple question i asked echo that google home had no problem answering google search is the best bar none one of the bonus of amazon echo is surely felt if you are a amazon prime member for example i asked echo to check my order status for item i ordered on amazon and it told me i had item out for delivery today also you can ask echo what are today is deal on amazon and it asks whether you want to buy the item it mention there is a lot of potential and more benefit for amazon prime customer overall i really enjoyed using the amazon echo and i am impressed with the design and build quality amazon is usage of bing for searching is definitely lacking mpared to google this is a solid mplimentary assistant for amazon prime member bluetooth is a plus for sure pro solid build and design quality good audio quality sensitive mic perfect for amazon prime subscriber n amazon bing search is not nearly a good a google alexa app need improvement
i have wanted my amazon echo for several year and wa able to buy one but not without an extended warranty which if you buy any any thing from best buy it is now imperative you spend your money for an extended warranty like now if it wa not for the warranty on my moto phone that i had to return it which is totally dysfunctional now and friend cannot get it to work my new exchanged phone hastotally screwed up my availability to access pandora luckily there is an extended warranty you have no choice but to purchase they try to make everything right with customer

the old fire tv is had an optical audio out is pdif the new one only have an hdmi output great if you have a new a v setup that ha hdmi pa through on the receiver not so good if you want to run video through hdmi and audio to your receiver i should have probably nsidered a roku

the tablet is good for the price is really being sold
so easy to set up and use downloading book from the library ha never been easier had an older nook before this and the weight is similar liked the nook button on the back to turn it off better than this one located on the bottom edge

this is just an awesome tablet for the price and the feature it ha
i love the fire tv because i can stream all nfl game with the kodi app and all of my prime show
performs much better than the tv fire stick gen and still able to side load android apps apk we were able to load some international apks that allows u to stream tv show from different untries onto the fire tv we uld do this with the fire stick to but occasionally the stream would hang not sure if the improved performance is due to upgraded cpu and ram or with wired ethernet connection instead of wifi or both i got the gen tv stick and even that appear to be performing better so maybe it more of a upgraded cpu none of her tv show have chocked and requires restart yet
this is my send kindle the first one lasted several year i enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light the backlight work very well and doe not have the eye strain that a tablet may have with the touch surface i find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several page the side page turn work very well much easier to travel with this unit than a large book

i had resisted a kindle for year and finally gave in for travel yes i am one of those who love book surprisingly i really like the paper white kindle it is easy to read work well in most lighting situation there are two thing that keep me from loving it i really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud i thought it would be a lot cheaper to get book for the kindle it may be a little cheaper but not a lot you would think that without the st of paper etc that saving would be passed on to the customer since they do not i tuck it away until i travel
this is a great tablet for streaming netflix hulu and sling tv it doesnt do so well for exploring the internet a it seems to be slow to load mpared to other tablet the limited memory is more than sufficient to download several movie and show for long car ride the battery life is also impressive
affordable and it get the job done not the most cutting edge device but nice nonetheless
my daughter wa very happy she got for her birthday right away put it to work
loved it it is exactly what i needed for my granddaughter she can play unlimited game

my husband bought a paperwhite for himself a few month ago but at the time i turned down his offer to buy one for me a well thinking i would ntinue to read on my tablet however when we spent time reading and relaxing in the yard i became jealous that he uld read his scree so easily while i struggled to see mine at all in the end i caved and let him buy one for me a well and i love it it is neat and small and light weight and easy to hold and the battery last more than a week
this kindle is everything i wanted no glare no bell and whistle simply a device i can read a book on anywhere i would highly remmend it
fire box wa a perfect up grade to my tv entertainment system the ability to show k movie made it perfect my daughter get to see her cartoon and i get to see my action movie perfectly you can use ethernet and dual band wifi it so much in a small box with a low price it perfect
awesome ereader for anyone looking for nvince of paperless book the ability to adjust the backlight is awesome
still learning previously used a nexus like the larger screen reading kindle book on it is good too
the new version ha ppi which is the same a the voyage there is no reason to pay for extra just for the page press
i love this tablet perfect size great graphic and speed purchased this on sale during the holiday great value
alexa is great to have around especially if you have amazon prime literally the music will go all day until you ask her to stop best buy had an incredible price on her the echo doe a variety of thing besides play music if you are into gadget this will not disappoint you
i bought one and then another one i have been trying a lot of cheap tablet just to see how they mpete with high end tablet this one so far it is the best of the best quality and price wise i mean dollar really i feel like i m getting paid to take it home amazing product you wonbe disappointed screen is not that good but then again dollar buy it give it a spin you wonbe disappointed it very fast for such a small tablet
good price for a tablet i wa really impress with all that it uld do
really enjoying my product clear picture great sound quality
got one for my kid and they love it it wa super easy to set what apps they uld have access to and stream prime show not a huge fan of the amazon app store mpared to my android phone
purchased this for my son ha room to upgrade memory to allow more book game but the speaker uld be better or located in a better position
high quality and very dependable very easy to set up
easy for my year old mom to use screen is clearly visible
it is very easy to navigate threw my child love it
i have had several variation of the kindle in the past my most recent being a paperwhite i have to say this is the best the size and balance are better the adaptable light feature and brightness is good screen quality and nstruction are both an improvement the overall reading experience is much improved over the paperwhite
small mpact and perfect for travel able to be read while the sun is shining directly on it
i ordered a roku premiere and decided to go with this instead read that roku owner were having fit with that and the ultra returned the roku w o ever opening it good call this doe what i needed
it is better than the st version kindle with internet access
replaced paper white with voyage amazing screen
one of the best and most price efficient tablet out there
i love the picture quality from this device cannot go wrong with a k also the picture steaming on the tv screen amazing good job amazon
the kindle will never take the place of an ipad or samsung galaxy tab but they st very little perfect for kid and adult alike especially good for those who do not want to spend six week learning to use it it is very simple to set up right out of the box it work great with the prime membership if you want to watch movie or hulu netflix the ipad is superior for quality of picture again you pay a hefty price for this quality if you just want something simple and hard to break think young kid or teen this is definitely the best option
love that i do not have to nstantly go to the movie and having thing at my fingertip work
first of all i pleased on how easy it wa to buy the product on line and it wa here exactly the date that they said it would be i enjoy the kindle it is easy to use
bonus that i can link my smart home light outlet thermostat and have echo ntrol device with a voice mmand
i really like this product i love all the apps i love the alexa feature that work with the remote there are option to mod this a well to do more better than an apple tv similar to a roku
we have both the apple tv and now fire stick and i d have to say that we use the fire stick more it is user interface is pretty decent once you re use to it and the available apps are great we honestly have no mplaints about it also you can do a lot more on these than the other smart device that do not allow you to use third party apps nice to be able to customize your device the way you want if you ask me easy setup and i actually really like the voice activated remote
my favorite new product that can do anything i love my alexa a an alarm clock
bought this an an auxiliary pad instead of a send ipad which i have had for year so far other than reading book on it i have not been able to acmplish much most of the apps i use on my ipad do not have a mpatible version but it wa cheap so even a just an e reader i decided to keep it
very good for what i wanted it for great speaker
unlike my kindle nd generation which requires an external light to read the paperwhite can be used in the dark
great product for quickly charging your kindle
great addition to any medium center easy to use and great picture and sound quality
not much can be added to the already substantial positive review i bought both the fire tv and fire stick so i ll mment on that the fire tv is much quicker and love the ability to run ethernet and usb right to the unit the fire stick is great for our bedroom but this fire tv is best for main tv viewing
good for reading price is good e ink is good for reading
got this for my daughter nd birthday and she absolutely love it
i will buy another one very nvenient and portable
bought this for my grandson a i had bought one a year before for my other grandson great for younger one
i bought this to replace the inch version i lost in the airport i wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolution it is much when loading game in offline mode a well a video i have downloaded from amazon prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available that wa a plus for me and now that the updated netflix app allows the same thing i have plenty of video i can also play my mp video using vlc player that i load to a microsd card of urse you have wifi and bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music the in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show i highly remmend this
great with no or low light good battery life syncs easy
it seems alexa doe not really do anything for free haha you have to subscribe to just about everything i tried it for a uple of day and returned it
i bought the echo for it music ability and the ability to listen to the radio my only wish is that amazon finally allows amazon music to be played a an alarm
work great good sound quality easy and fun to use
this is a very affordable tablet for a kid just bought a case online and it is perfect for taking it around
great addition to the home so easy to set up and use i love the shortcut it ha provided to my life
it is light and nvenient to carry i can in fact carry it in my jacket pocket so it is good when i am moving around by bus book downloads are instant and do not take a long time something i wa ncerned about and the screen is truly mfortable no strain whatsoever the function within the kindle are also nvenient enough to use i bought it for during black friday deal

i purchased this for my year old and it wa at a great price point i like the parental ntrols feature with the multiple profile this allows me to ntrol what she ha access to which is a plus for me
i purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my need were and how well the kindle uld meet them despite the walled garden philosophy that tether you mostly to amazon product and service the ability a of right now to side load the google play store make this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point
purchased for a grandson but everyone in the house enjoys it

i bought the first edition kindle fire year ago my kid loved it so much that i bought this product to replace the old one they love this one even more larger screen and more memory you cannot go wrong

great tablet especially for the price it is not an ipad by any mean but will run and play a lot of android apps work off wifi and ha a micro ad card reader
for the price you cannot beat this tablet for kid i m not a fan of amazon is super restricted app store but the device itself is very good i love the curfew feature you can set up time that a child can or cannot access the tablet without your permission
bought this for our year old daughter and she u it daily she enjoys watching movie on it and playing learning game so far it ha been very durable and battery life ha been great

purchased a a christmas gift for my sister during black friday great tablet for reading book surfing web etc etc for your daily need
mpact easy to hold great for playing game easy to use keyboard
it is an ok product but the main reason for the purchase wa because it wa for a first time tablet owner it is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of suck but like it say it is ok for the price
this unit ha a speaker built in the bullet ha to be connected to an external source in order for it to obey the mmands great purchase
this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or mputer and buy an echo dot

i just want a small tablet to check news weather etc from time to time and this product work well for that purpose it is not a fast on my ipad but it is a good choice nsidering the price
i m an avid reader and love the kindle voyage i love the adjustable font and that it automatically adjust to the light setting the push side to flip page but not if you accidentally bump the wrong side which ha happened a few time great battery life it is usually a uple of day before i have to recharge
purchased this for my grandson it work great however if i were to do it over again i would spend the extra to get the one without the ad they drive you crazy the ad make the cheaper unit really frustrating
we had given hand me down iphones to the kid to use for car trip and the like a while back and were looking to update them for the price this is the best deal you have access to a lot of the same apps although you might have to start them over it ha a durable case and is a good size for little hand it is very helpful to be able to time activity so they do not have a choice about handing it back over only downside is one of our rds doe not charge a well a we d like and sometimes it seems a little slow starting certain apps in mparison to our apple product but if you do not want to pay the apple price this is the way to go kid will definitely be entertained by it

i should have done some research before buying the tap i would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated also i thought it would be more like siri where you can ask anything alexa is answer to most question is i do not understand the question the bluetooth speaker work fine
very simple very light and ha all the basic feature you will be looking for in a tablet but do not expect a fancy device
it is good and fast it doe what you want it for i use it mainly for reading and my son play a few game on it alright product

this is by far the best streaming device around my chromecast wa just given to someone free of charge that wa a waste of money there is not much you cant do with this uple this with a prime membership and by by cable
this is my third kindle plus i have used the kindle app on my two ipads and three iphones i always want to have a real kindle so i will read in peace and avoid distraction from email text and such this is much more readable that all of the previous model the resolution is a good a i uld ever want the lighting is perfectly even and make reading in any light or lack of mpletely mfortable the screen response is almost perfect but i am just getting use to the new side area to turn page i love the weight and can read in any position including on my back in bed with one hand i am perfectly fine with paying for this kindle if you want something to read your book and nothing else this is the product for you

i wanted the one with whispersync but none were available so for the st and having familiar ebook i purchased this unit great for taking to poolside or beach when on vacation
this tablet is perfect for kid and adult for me if i wa the owner i would not want a little bit more memory and ram but that is why i own a laptop now it ha an interface that allows you to set up a profile for a kid individually that is what make it perfect for kid and you ntrol it also ha latest and greatest apps exc it run game ok but movie stream well and really for me this is great i have girl from age to and they all have something and this one is the best of all of them

an easy way to read your favorite book whether you re in the sun or in the dark this is the best kindle ever the only thing i do not like is the flash when you turn the page
bought this for my year old and he absolutely love it the free pre installed apps the high lor resolution the overall quality is great unfortunately no google product are on this tablet and chromecast is not an option amazon firestick ready this is the only reason i gave it star instead of
i think alexa is great we first saw it while visiting family and were intrigued we used our best buy point so the risk wa minimal alexa is great at answering question related to whether sporting event calendar shopping and todo list i like that i can print out my todo and shopping list and that she can add event to my online calendar we have not even scratched the surface and we love alexa already we also decided to join amazon prime and are very satisfied so far keep up the good work amazon
love the larger screen and picture clarity it is very easy to use
the echo is great be sure and check out the alexa skill
like all the feature and voice regnition is very good although the product wa setup for berlin weather which make me think this wa a returned device and resold
this ha a lot of good feature to limit the amount of time and what is accessed
bought the echo originally in black but had to exchange it due to unresponsiveness i think i got a dud but changed it out for the new white echo and it work great must have for amz prime member since you can get prime only alexa deal play amz prime music library free and use it to turn on off light using wemo
this device is awesome if you already have a prime subscription it allows you to have siri like function and even order direct from amazon speaker doe not sound bad either i would remmend this item if you also have smart plug to turn on and off small appliance or light
great value for price can add a gb card for almost unlimited storeage can download video audio to play offline
this is great for watching amazon original show and free tv
work with a lot of different brand and is easy to set up
i m using it with kodi and so far have not had any mplaints i bought a gb ad card for more memory but cannot tell yet if it is helping
a an owner of an ipad i hesitated to nsider the amazon fire tablet a a supplemental device but my purchase of a network of amazon echo dot and the voice cast capability with the fire tablet wa almost irresistable so i bought one a a gift for my friend along with an amazon echo dot to get her opinion of it value my friend just raf about the fire tablet especially the smaller light weight aspect of it i know i would feel better toting around a small fire tablet that sts only instead of a ipad so it look like the next fire tablet will be for me
speaker is much better than the smaller one but can be connected to other speaker a well easy to do literally everything via voice
amazing item that everyone in the whole family enjoys

fun to play with ask question get weather traffic report or listen to music
it is amazing product i love it amazon always provide amazing product and good price
my favorite feature is that it will play almost any music you ask it to and it answer almost anything you ask it
the product wa just what i thought it d be worked right out of the box and installation
other digital device are distracting kindle keep you focused and give a good feeling of reading
i really like the kindle and appreciate the nvenience i use it all the time and especially like that it is backlit so i can read at night without turning on a light the only thing i have not figured out is how to tell which of the downloaded book i have already read my old kindle labeled them clearly but i cannot find it on this new one a small problem that is easily worked around
i had bought a nabi for my granddaughter and she finally broke it out of warranty i just fugured i d purchase another one since she is familiar with it after reading review decided kid are pretty sharp and can pick up new thing quickly she is she had no trouble with it at all and my daughter say she love it so far no mplaints from a technical standpoint
i lost my tablet in germany and wanted a replacement fast best buy had both the and inch kindle fire in stock after reading the review i decided to go with the inch boy wa i glad that i did the larger viewing area is great for watching movie and netflix on the airplane the inch ha stereo sound unlike the inch which ha only mono overall i am really happy with this tablet
this tablet is very easy to set up and use it is just a advertised
i purchased several of these for gift everyone loved them work great and easy to use
i use it mostly for reading and it work well i only wish that the camera wa better but it is okay for that price
bought this for each of my grandchild and they loved it very user friendly
the processor wa so slow it took about five minute to load a five minute youtube video with mb min internet
i love my firestick i dropped my cable a year ago and dont miss it at all
it is a decent quality tablet for the money one mplaint is the speaker are weak have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback the silk browser seems to have issue with search engine just switching the search engine fix it though i got this for when the power go out at my house it is served to let me watch netflix with a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out note video quality is good enough though that ha more to do with not being super picky about it i m nsidering gifting my dad one of these this year he mmented that the quality looked good another mplaint would be the amazon app store is limited no clash royale which is the only mobile game i actually enjoy i m sure there is a way around this but i m really not interested in digging around for it so for the most part it is a good solid low end tablet
ha kid timer to limit your child is time using the tablet fun camera for kid with sticker my kid love it
it is great in performance mpared to fire stick amazing product
you get lot of movie tv show from amazon prime
very happy with the tap we have the echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck with the tap we just take it off the charging stand and go no more bothering with bluetooth speaker and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the internet with tap

i bought the fire for a send tv a i already have one and like it i bought the fire because i am a prime member
gave this a a gift to my husband he like it very much but wish it came with a separate manual of written instruction for using the different function he is not a fan of searching for instruction on a device he is not familiar with in the first place that is frustrating
i am enjoying the many capability this product offer
great item i read in the dark without strain and never disturb my wife is sleep user friendly and durable i have not been a reader until now have several book but it is at night when i have time to read but have to have a light on this ha been the game changer two thumb up
we originally owned an original kindle but it wa slow app store wa not the best and overall interface wa to be desired in fact eventually the device crashed and uld not be revered with limited use deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a samsung tablet but it wa too small this wa such a good deal it wa hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try this device is a great size and much better interface would buy again and will nsider in the future for the kid
very handy should be included with the kindle
the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphic are much better too

this certainly is not the most impressive device out there but at it is a fantastic value
the amazon fire tablet are nice tablet they re especially great for streaming tv and movie and since it is a kindle it is great for book too it is a little odd with the internet browser and still a little limited in the app store but overall a great little tablet

easy to read screen in a small light package excellent battery life and even fit into my work pocket

i got it at a great price they price matched for me much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
you really cannot get much better than a kindle for reading ebooks the paperwhite is great a it ha a touchscreen and ha a backlight for reading in just about any environment
cannot beat for price feel expensive but is not doe all the basic
we purchased two paperwhite is and gave one to our daughter so far so good
love everything about the unit except that it get hot when used for to minute hope it doe not burn or explode
i wa familiar with the previous paperwhite lower re product that wa fine for the price it is a great reader the new higher re standing side by side is an improvement would remmend

we bought of these for our kid and they love them nice prenatal feature to limit use and restrict ntent in the amazon e system build quality seems good glad we choose these over the cheaper brand that wa only a few buck le
bought this for my mom surprisingly very capable and fast quad processor for the price unbelievable user friendly
it basically make any old tv a smart tv it is also k uhd that is one of the biggest plus on top of me having amazon prime already
cheap but ok processor is an excellent deal response from touchscreen not great a ipad but price reflected
it is better than in thought it wa at first i didnt like how small the screen wa but then the nistent reading it got much better after a month i it grew on me
incredible range clear sound we bought the sleeve and hung it in the backyard for a party amazing clear sound
this version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before very happy with it
for under it is cheap and so so with stocked firmware but you can root it then put a new custom firmware on it after such you are no longer have many annoying pop up and adware from amazon and i feel like my fire table is now worth at leat time more than what i have paid for it
am enjoying using echo learn more thing to do with it each day sound is good and i enjoy listening to music on my echo also like finding out about the weather each day
this tablet from amazon can do most thing like the bigger more expensive tablet at a fraction of the st the two mplaints i have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery doe not last a long a an ipads other than that it ha plenty of apps and thing that it can do like netflix etc
it wa everything i expected it to be very pleased i would remmend this product and your store to everyone i know
we purchased the echo a a gift for my wife my family love it
very pleased with this purchase i no longer need cable tv service since i purchased this easy to set up simple remote ntrol
great item to have nsolidate all your apps to watch show no issue at all
when i purchased it i wa skeptical about the voice regnition but echo is great this product will be a break thru for lot of other home automaton to me in the future must try
i have the fire stick and now the box highly remmend
purchased the amazon fide hd a a gift for my dad who ha been overjoyed with it the display look great and it offer him access to many of the feature he look for in a tablet from e book streaming video or online shopping the price is low because amazon is o is restrictive but for simple or specific need this product is great
for an inexpensive black friday special i have to say that i am quite impressed with this tablet well worth the price tag the speaker leave a lot to be desired but when used with an external speaker it sound great the battery life is also impressive i have been using it for hour and the battery level is now at remaining i must admit that i wa somewhat hesitant to purchase it but i figured that for the price i would give it a try i am not sorry for my decision i have another tablet that st time a much and there is no difference in the performance even at the everyday price of this tablet is worth the money
i waited for week to get this new model and am happy i did i love the new feature on the kindle voyage didngive it star due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive button i do not know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error but sometimes it is more challenging than i think it should be to get the page to turn it is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what i typically do but regardless i love the voyage it wa definitely worth the wait
it wa not worth my money to be honest but it is good whenever your bored
this equipment will help u with our viewing of movie that we want
pretty good sound for a mono speaker hears u clearly from many foot away use it to stream music from pandora actually love this thing we linked a really good blue tooth speaker to it and the sound is great be aware that you can only link one other blue tooth device to the echo
great speaker sound and ease of setup work great with amazon music option
mpared to the galaxy kid tablet this wa a better deal and more durable for child below yr old
the voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader it is not a tablet so do not expect feature of an internet tablet however the auto adjust backlight feature minimal flash between page make it ideal for reader this version includes the vocabulary builder which i find myself using a lot nowadays however i m not sure why it is more expensive than the paperwhite that is the one i actually wanted but my local store wa out of stock i thought it included the g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doe not so that is why i m nfused on the price difference the overall feel of it is fine not a lot thinner than the original i keep mine in a case and whenever it go idle i have to take it out of the case just to press the power button which is pretty innvenient oh and it freeze when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because i thought it wa broken but i just held the power button for like ten sends and it wa fine other than those very minor mplaints i love it i find myself reading way more than watching tv these day so that is always a plus
easy to set up easy to use good for throwing in your bag and having access to book all of the time

easy to set up ready to go i start my morning asking about the weather and traffic i bought this thinking i would eventually buy the smart bulb hub etc so i can have alexa turn on off the outside light so far very pleased great sound quality for a smaller device i wa really impressed with the speaker
g kid came over early for christmas age and they opened basketball hoop and backboard a camera lego toy but they went crazy when they opened the fire tablet by the time they went home they had already downloaded game apps to play thanks for a great christmas
very pleased with the quality of this tablet and i wa fortunate that it wa on sale at the time of purchase
i wonleave home without it now it allows me to take my library with me anywhere i go without having to lug dozen of book around while i do enjoy the feel and smell of a good book the kindle is an absolute delight to read from
much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for it size
i now have of these you need to get one asap i m a huge fan of the slingbox app and the prime feature
the amazon fire stick is everything that i expected and more i loved the pricing and the fact that all fire stick are voice activated easy to navigate through is of free movie and game
i mainly used this device to ntrol some home automation item in the house and to watch quick youtube video for it price it is a great device do not expect it to be the greatest tablet out there
very good e reader like the back light very much very light for carrying around
bought this item a a present for my llege age son didnknow much about kindles but my research led me to this model may not have all the bell and whistle of a more expensive version but it is suiting him just fine easy to use and read good size i m pleased he is pleased
great for taking on trip gb camera mputer
love it very easy to use good picture for movie
great tool for streaming hd is awesome and sound is to only wish it had ability to stream from usb stick or external hdd
these is so much this unit can do i do remmend this one over the fire stick i have both only because of the buffering issue didnreally notice a difference between the wifi and ethernet rd plugged in
great tablet and very easy to use also good battery life
the original amazon echo pack quite a bit into one cylinder the sound is so much more than you d expect the voice regnition software is excellent and there is so much it can do i remmend using it with amazon prime to get the most out of the music this also work well with philip hue lighting
my kid love it battery life is longer than others
i purchased this a a gift after using this at another home i have also tried similar product and i feel that this ha the most interactive user interface it ntinually is learning and ha good sound quality for what we use it for
i had an older kindle that worked great but finally died my husband had a white page and seemed to love it after purchasing mine i understand why i highly remmend this to anyone who read a lot
i bought this tablet for my year old son the tablet ha a nice screen resolution stay charged for a long period of time and carry a lot of free apps for the price you are definitely getting more than what you are paying for i have purchased this item for all of my kid they never mplain about the tablet not working or freezing
i bought this after subscribing to an amazon prime membership this is a great little tablet at such a low price too good of a deal to pa up when it wa on sale it ha the ability to talk to alexa surf the web listen to music and read book magazine lot of free music and book for prime member
this is the best tablet that ha ever me on the market for
it just enough for my yr old enough storage space easy to navigate through
this item is perfect for child and great for parent it provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child u it
awesome device i used to have an ipad mini and really expected to be disappointed by the fire i m not not at all it is great and doe everything i want it to do
have amazon echo dot and now the tap all work very well and the tap sound great
my daughter absolutely love her tablet and i love it to for her it is very kid friendly
no reason to shop around at this price there is something for everybody i bought at black friday price for gift no mplants
it is highly remmended for someone who love reading easy set up lot of book to download i have ipad but this beat reading experience hand down one downside is that the new kindle paperwhite ha lower battery life mpared to it is previous generation hence only star
reason i would not give it a full five star is because of the fact that is so loaded down with adware for amazon but an awful lot of that is what make it affordable so cannot beat it
take getting use to asking the question in the right way alexa is still learning so at time can be frustrating when asking question great for music weather date and schedule request it an entertaining mpanion when your home and enjoying some private time
ok reader battery power not what advertized not able to upgrade
sadly no having netflix support is resulting in my last tablet purchase from amazon
it is a great starter tablet for kid an even adult at a good price you can also use a memory card
bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad she is happier with the size the resolution is nice great buy for the price
it work good i would remmend to friend and family
i tried the amazon fire tv after trying the fire stick sue to the better rating on resolution and the ability to hardware my internet connection to it with these two feature the high definition in no different than what i had with directv which solidified this wa the right decision i now have of them in each room of my home
i bought this a a gift for my mother and she love it
a good plug
this is a good entry tablet for toddler i like the amazon exchange policy if it break
alexa is ol and can actually understand what i say and ask which wa one of my worry for everything alexa can do i feel like i got a good deal
worked great but after awhile i would not unlock after i d enter my pin the screen would go black i took it to geek squad luckily i bought the protection plan and told me they do not fix them they just replace them so i got another one but that one did the exact same thing ended up returning that one too
not a big a the fire box yet it not that much slower very satisfied
this a great tablet my grandaughter u the kindle setting for her little girl who is in pre school
she work well if you know exactly what to say if you say something that is not precise for the action you want she will not understand she is smart and useful but she still ha a few kink to work out
we have amazon prime so i wanted to replace my older apple tv so i uld stream directly to the tv very happy with purchase alexa work well which is an upgrade over just the fire stick
this tablet serve the purpose it purchase for my daughter love it and help her greatly with her play time
i wa really excited for this speaker got it all hooked up to my echo and wa ready to go then i listened to the music it ha no bass if you want something the ha a good range of sound this is not it it is focused on treble only no low end i ended up getting the jbl charge love it
my family love the firetv the only thing we had to do wa upgrade our internet speed
my wife use the echo every day and it is gotten time better now that we have added the philip hue and nest thermostat in with it
this is great for my mom it is easy for her to use
this tablet is fast expendable and cheap it run the android o which house most of the game and apps you ll find on any android phone my only mplaints with this tablet are the screen and camera the screen bemes washed out at a degree angle or more and the camera are unusable due to the noise they produce otherwise this is a really great product
our kid ranging from like this product it is very versatile for all age
we purchased the amazon echo on a whim but really enjoy using it easy to get information with just a question listen to music get local weather information even my year old granddaughter know how to ask alexa question great addition to our household
sweet product by amazon a usual it is legit most definitely
i had microsoft surface unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet since went back to laptop for work didnneed another surface settled on kindle hd over samsung and ipad mini due to value i only use for social network email game internet search and occasional viewing of video this is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection great value a i paid under during the holiday and it ha been a good a my surface for these basic u
amazon fire tv is great and work very well not disappointed at all
i bought this tablet for my son it is the perfect size for him it doe everything any tablet or smartphone minus calling texting can do and you cannot beat the price for a name brand tablet
slightly slow however really good for the price also these amazon tablet do not use the normal google app store they use the amazon app store which is not a extensive a the google app store this can be a significant drawback
i am truly enjoying my echo she doe way more thing than i thought she uld do i love being able to just ask her something and she find it whether it is to play music find a radio station or put on the news or whether my husband is not very savvy with technology but i have found him using her a well she is a great mpanion to have in the house i am looking forward to learning more about what she can do
a a regular amazon prime user that get much of my staple through prime echo make it that much easier
i love the alexa it is so nvenient i have it in my kitchen so it readily accessible for music and trivia the sound is great love the music choice and the shopping list is a fantastic option
better than the stick doe not overheat and support k
we are still not using to the maximum ability but my wife love it
the best device for a child in the market purchased for an infant and after two week he is loving it easy to handle and durable
i have owned a few tablet and currently own an ipad and iphone i m invested in the amazon esystem via kindle e reader and fire tv is this tablet is incredibly affordable and offer acceptable performance but it is heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the google play store a the amazon app store is missing a huge number of every day apps it is a great extension for fire tv is and it is certainly a good choice a a primary tablet for kid or parent who do not have an apple budget personally i still find myself reaching for the ipad
can use it for facebook or email and of urse to read my book in a series love it
the reason i bought this model kindle wa for the backlight to read at night the internet connectivity is great too i have been reading a russian history book and use the dictionary and wikipedia lookup often to look up people and place with ease
i have had this tablet for about a month it is really good for basic use it met my expectation
must have
work great love the kid option easy to use power last longer than i thought
bought this for the wife because she listens to music all the time she enjoys the hand free aspect especially while oking myself and the kid enjoy messing with it by asking various question siri is more fun to argue with though pretty easy to set up and use great gift for those who are hard to buy for
purchased a a gift for a friend who ha never owned a tablet of any kind great little tablet for a beginner very good response time for the money you really cant go wrong
this tablet is very well made and well worth the price amazon ha a great market place and the tablet ha a nice clear picture and the touch screen function very well got it for my year old son and he love it plus i like that it ha parental ntrols so i can block out thing i do not want him accessing
the kindle fire is el fuego that mean it is good for what i ask it to do i watch movie read book search the internet for ingredient that allow me to make delicious oatmeal okies and when in a pinch this thing is just the right size to serve the okies on also
we really enjoy echo alexa is quick with our request i only wish she had more information like google
we purchased this tablet for our y ear old since all the other kid friendly tablet were limited it what they had on them something should be changed regarding the port for the charger the little area with the small bar in it keep bending to the point month later it broke off and of urse the warranty ha ended i am over tablet if you can buy it on black friday for buck or le it should be that price all year long so now he ha no tablet because i am not sending it out to have someone else is sent back to me re furbished i am very disappointed
great a long a your expectation are in line with st a little slow but totally usable
the amazon fire tv is an excellent product it ha so many capability that i can never use them all connects both wired and wi fi i have amazon prime and get more free stuff that really expands the experience if you have kid they cannotake the use to a whole new level
very pleased with the fire tv work faster than the fire stick more bang for the dollar
this is my send paper white and i am very satisfied
i had always wanted to try one of these out i finally got my chance while staying with some friend in vega i though it wa so ol how you uld ask alexa just about anything and she would have a response from playing a certain genus of music to top news story alexa doe it all after that trip i knew that i wa going to get one
i love the new kindle so much brighter then my old one
this is a great product battery life is very good great for reading at night and work great in sun light sign up through amazon and get book cheap or free
bought did not work out of the box too slow too much trouble to setup and requires amazon acunt to use returned both item
i love that it ha a clear picture and great volume
this is really the standard when it me to ereaders super light weight and crystal clear
i use it every day k show like the grand tour look impressive set up is easy
this replaced my year old keyboard unit which died after hitting the floor i expect this will be every bit a good kindle is my favorite reader
this tablet is the perfect solution for my need i uld easily have spent much more money for feature and capability that i do not need price size and function are just right
this is a good purchase for online surfing and checking my mail
this is my send kindle i use kindle to read fiction this is awesome
is table is good no to fast but work good nice picture
aside from all it is other capability i have yet to learn my favorite thing about the echo is telling alexa to add item to my shopping list then once i m at the store i m able to pull up my list on my alexa app no more sloppy grocery list no more accidentally leaving them at home best part is if i realize i m about to run out of something while oking i just tell alexa to add it to my shopping list without even having to pick up a pen or my phone
i have had every kindle since they came out and have been impressed by the innovation design and overall quality this one is the exception on all unts lightning issue on the bottom of the reader are distracting and i do not see a visible difference from the older model evidently production is of higher value than quality
i can get rid of the old stereo radio in my family room i use it all the time
ordered one for my daughter it is the fourth kindle we have bought and love them perfect for watching video and movie
wa using the kindle app on my phone and running the battery down and dealing with glare paperwhite resolve both these issue not a real bookbetter
purchased for yr old daughter it is easy for her to use and allows me to set time limit on her game internet and streaming
awesome i love to read and i use it everyday easy to read at night in dark
good tablet but it doe not include google play like i wa told it doe by an associate in your store
my daughter love this kindle she doe so much with it well worth the money
very good quality
got of these for my grandson and they love them
i like the fact that amazon keep evolving the device making it able to do new thing it is great for playing music at home because the sound quality for such a small device is excellent the shopping list feature is also nice because anyone with the alexa app and your amazon acunt can check to see whats on the list
easy to setup and fill the room with sound easy to move to another room if needed
this firetv is amazing in the way it cannoturn any tv into a smart tv it is quick and responsive we only using it for it streaming capability but so much more can be done with it we also own a firestick and they both seem the same for performance so if you only plan on using it streaming capability you might want to look into the cheaper firestick
my original kindle fire no longer accepted a charge i wa not going to replace it because i bought an ipad when i saw the hd in a kiosk in a bb store i realized how much better i liked the size and feel of it for reading book the ipad is preferred for other thing this fire is clarity is much improved over my old one plus it responds better i do not like that i cannot choose a photo for the locked screen that it ha to be an advertisement i also do not like that it usually take a few try to unlock menial issue from my perspective
great sounding speaker i purchased it a a gift
the kindle paperwhite is a great device to have while flying on long trip it help to past the time and it is very easy to use and transport in your personal luggage
lost my older kindle touch so needed to purchase a new one much the same a the old which is good not a hard learning curve this one however now ha the light which is great very light in weight also definitely remmend
i am not impressed at all i think you should save your money and get a smart watch instead this is a expensive item and doe not do enough for the money you spent the weather timer adding thing to your calendar that is just not enough half the thing you ask her she said she doe not understand
after having worn out one kindle and disvered kindle fire cannot be read in sunlight i decided on the kindle paperwhite infinitely readable and the light adjusts i love the new bookerly font
work better than what i expected able to surf the net and watch movie the battery life and screen are awesome bought this for under buck and looking to buy more to give a a gift
this is an awesome little tablet justright for reading and looking up image and thing on the net
bought a a gift and person that received the kindle ha really enjoyed it
quick and easy to operate also output k which is great for my vizio k
i enjoy my kindle fire very much great price buy
my son is having a blast basic screen but very versatile
have the gaming version myself but got the normal version for my sister can easily load any apps or game you want to run provided they are android based great for streaming with a much higher frame rate then the stick but the stick work fine for say the kid playroom remmend it to anyone looking for a simple and small system probably be a go to christmas give this year
i have fire stick for few year and using it everyday my smart tv is le smarter than it i do not use the smart function of the tv i purchased fire tv month ago and i cannot live without it an excellent product from amazon highly remmended
this kindle is a great buy pretty simple to use very nvenient
i held off purchasing the echo for many reason not the least of which wa the uncertainty about the state of voice regnition and ai accurate responsiveness my only regret now is that i didnbuy the echo sooner than i did i love her i mean it every day i m integrating the echo into my life and into my home more and more i even purchased a send one for the bedroom the one drawback is that i sometimes have to repeat myself a few time before i m understood i have found that the more voice training i do the le frequent i have this problem and right out of the box i wa surprised at just how accurately alexa understood and instantly responded with relevant accurate and timely information yes i am crazy bout alexa
this is a great tablet for the price work excellent memory card capability make it even better
love it i got it for my kid it more durable than a apple table
nice for my daughter good product reliable easy carrington nvenient
wonderful item work well with current set up highly remmend

very good tablet the price is worth you have and the price and quality in the same product
not a bad product and for the price it make a decent gift
i bought it to have at work since it is small and affordable the picture quality is great and the sound a well my tablet ha turned into the office music source on day there is not anything good on the radio
this is my third kindle work offshore and read a lot unable to carry book with me so the kindle is perfect
i have an older kindle and enjoyed it very much however there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed upgradable storage and longer battery life i m really happy
i got this for basic internet access reading kindle book and watching netflix work great no problem now if you want to download a ton of show extra memory will be needed
love this tablet it is perfect for kid teen and adult i have in my home we all love them perfect for searching the internet playing game keeping up with the news and tv show you love it connects right to my fire stick and i watch movie without hooking up all kind of cable uld not believe the price best bargain on a quality tablet thanks best buy
it good product but it ha a big problem the battery is the big issue for this device
i bought about tablet before this is the best tablet i ever bought
tablet is easy to use and i can carry it with me in a medium size purse easy to down load book and other information i had the kindle before and this upgrade is a pleasure
my kid love them able to do so many thing with it
i bought one for myself and a few others for a raffle this is a great tablet for a great price it doe not have all of the apps that the google store ha but amazon underground ha some great free apps it is got good external storage option and a fast processor i highly remmend
amazed that with the kindle fire my kid are able to play game view movie and read
this is my send kindle and i love it it is so nvenient to be able to carry around hundred of book without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundred of book i just wish i uld have bought accessory at best buy also the sale rep knew nothing about the device and had to goggle info on her phone
this kindle is very light so easy to hold for a long time without getting tired worth upgrading your older version kindle
bought one of these to get something to try out kodi a a streaming medium device it work really well i love the fact you can have your netflix and other apps right at hand i can still run plex and kodi installs in a matter of minute nice to have a single device to run all my need and totally replaced the need for cable the stick work well but the extra grunt of this is worth the additional spend
i bought this and the kid version past christmas it lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read book do not waste money on this product the kid version is a good ideal but loading the apps when they work take forever when they do work the kid enjoy them so i nsider it to be a hit and miss i ll be canceling the subscription a soon a my free year is up not wasting money on it
i have had several kindles in the past really love the paperwhite because of the light and being able to read outside
great buy deff worth the money much faster than my phone
really nvenient is amazing how many thing you can do with alexa also really responsive
how can you mplain about anything this food for this cheap
this wa a good investment that being said do yourself a favor and buy a sd micro card and add it on before you download anything make it run that much smoother
love my kindle it work so good i take it everywhere i go
great starter kindle for the kid they enjoy the ability to surf
purchased a a gift work great we love the kindle paperwhite because it can be read outside with no glare
i liked it would be better if battery last longer great if you use amazon or shop a lot there i still love my ipad but apple rip the wallet i loved this tablet
purchased this a a gift for a teenage kid a a graduation present very pleased with the purchase the kid love it small size but good speaker perfect for the llege dorm where he is scheduled to go in a uple of month love how the device connects to the cloud and keep itself updated
great love that i can monitor the time used in certain thing
it is an easy to use tablet and my girl love it great price
exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
easy to use and fun too great for math and history question and perfect for making a shopping list
best home automation assistant got it for during one day sale will remmend
the amazon echo is great for our family a it allows u to all have prime music playlist and with a simple voice mmand we can all play our favorite music setting up our smart home item wa a breeze and telling alexa to set the thermostat temperature and to turn on and off light is awesome
so far so good no problem and would remmend to everyone ha crisp clear picture and easy to navigate around without help or instruction manual
it performs just a advertised and i keep finding new task for her if you love gadget like i do this is a must have
you really cannot go too wrong with this purchase because of the price work very well but do not expect ipad quality doe everything i have asked of it but some web page are harder to read partially because of it is small size which can be handy and it is lower resolution it is a good send tablet and is better watching a movie on then a smaller phone cannothrow it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it a you might be with a more expensive tablet
i have been enjoying the amazon tap for two week and am still finding new thing it will do
great alternative to using tablet for reading only problem is trying to read a pdf file it only enlarges the page and doe not resize the document to easily move forward
love my new kindle fire the price wa very reasonable
my kid use it for playing game only memory is too limited if you want to expand memory you have to buy special memory card from amazon regular card wonwork i ll like the app free time to help protect the kid from what they watch and play but it is difficult and time nsuming to get update for the game they play amazon doe not have the best user friendly software for their tablet they do what we get it for entertain the kid for awhile
i have been watching the review online and checking with friend that have purchased the echo to see how much they liked or disliked it feature last person i talked to went on and on about all the thing there were using it for and that persuaded me it wa time and amazon prime day wa the perfect opportunity to go for it amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info taining mmand center there are so many ol and awesome thing it able to do that i ll hit the highlight that work for our household first we love that it follows your voice in the room the circle lighting will show which direction it is listening the speaker is wonderfully balanced so whether listening to music the news or to alexa speaking i have nothing but high mark for it sound quality given it size next set up after downloading the app to our iphones wa quick easy and very intuitive the more you look over the app the more you will realize a world of skill that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them we have added thing to shopping list while asking about the weather and our calendar of event and then asked alexa to change the temp of our nest thermostat in various part of the house simply by saying her name and then our mmands sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pa through she is always there listening and ready we have ordered some led programmable light and i can hardly wait for alexa to help set the mood in the house room to room all from a simple voice request even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone tablet and watch that can ntrol device it huge to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion i am a regular amazon prime shopper and reviewer if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the echo please mark the â helpfulâ button it tell amazon that folk are in fact reading review like this thanks
i m pleased with echo disappointed that it came late
upon using a few other android device i settled on this the software is perfect snappy and overall awesome very easy to set up just sign into your amazon acunt much much faster than the fire stick itself that is how you can justify the st if you are looking for an android style device look no further than this
replaced my original kindle after if got dropped and screen no longer readable turned this new kindle on after charging it and all my book were already there i didnhave to do anything
my other daughter ha this same tablet so i knew it would be a winner with my other child a well
cliche alert i never do product review let me tell you i m a apple fanboy and i am angry that i purchased the new apple tv before the amazon fire tv
processor is pretty quick screen resolution is fantastic so far they have been a great value
it is perfect size to take with you any where it ha great lor and the sound can get really loud for it is size there are a number of game book video movie and apps that you can get on it some of which are free you can surf the web and also listen to music on it my son love his and my mother in law love hers
great deal very good sound quality fun just play with
easy to set up and simple price is good cant mplaint
i find it very helpful in finding music from year ago i also find useful in getting the weather for downey california
i have not used it a ton yet but i am very happy with my experience so far
the amazon fire hd is one of the best deal on the market i have had a ipad and would rather have the hd it is what of the price of a ipad and just a good if not better
after your initial kindle library download the battery should last week with the backlight close to the highest setting
the fire tv wa easy to set up and we have had no problem i do suggest unplugging when not in use a the box doe heat up just to be safe
these unit get better and better lot of apps available easy to use easy to set up why pay is of dollar more for a smart tv that is restricted to only a few dozen apps amazon ha thousand of apps from movie and tv show to game and entertainment great option for any tv in your house
after only day the device would not charge it wa plugged in each evening and on the th day it wa at after being plugged in all night this wa our send amazon fire tablet the first one stopped charging in month right after the manufacturer is warranty expired decided to get another one because it wa a great deal but sadly i have learned you do not even get what you pay for with this tablet
bought this for a year old she love it she is already got more thing figured out on it than i do good educational program and some fun one too
it is been solid so far can get a little glitchy every now and then the text is not a high a quality a it uld look and it may bother some people that not all apps from apple and google are available on the amazon app store but for the price i think it is a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing email music video etc
got it so i can have everything in one device and it doe that flawless it is very fast and responsive and the voice search is really good
my son totally love it the size is just right and it is pretty fast i do not have any mplaints about it
easy to get started with usefulfeatures a i learn of new skill and try them alexa get more entertaining efficient and helpful assistant
perfect for what it is a cheap tablet i bought it for my dad and he love it
the screen resolution is quite sharp vivid and the battery last a long time but i found a major drawback in a sense it is like being nfined to an amazon playground big yes but accessing the bigger outside world can be a challenge i often get sidetracked to amazon authorized plaything and getting around them while doable well they do not make it easy the only key is stubborn persistence
i slept on this item now that i have a nest thermostat it is my new best friend
great purchase easy to operate and smooth transaction
easy set up effortless bout one for my year old father and he u it without any help
i have reviewed several unit and this is still the best easy to install and setup and if you are a prime member it make it all the better
i wa looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price great screen clarity good adjustment too work well and the battery life is great size is nice too big enough for hand if needed
my wife read a lot and thought this would be a good gift being a prime member a well a her signing up for unlimited she can be reading something anytime which give me time to play video game
work great the talking assistant is a great novelty although i personally do not use it that much hd clarity is fantastic on a k tv highly remmended if not using on a smart tv which can already connect to amazon by itself although the hd is actually better through the external device
very nice product must buy it is a great for kid a well
this a great tablet for kid my twin had them last year but one of them broke because my daughter dropped it so she is requesting another one for christmas it serf it purpose for the price
i got this device to start my home automation system alexa play my favorite iheart station at the touch of the app on my phone she also turn on and off four light bulb at my mmand i ask her the day is weather forecast for my city she also keep my weekly grocery list and it go right to the phone app i hope to add other job for in the future i went with these device because she ha more experience than the google device
alexa integrated work faster then the fire stick i would remmend this device watch my k video
purchased this for year old boy and uld not be happier
my old kindle had no camera and wa much thicker this one ha a great camera and is much slimmer
good little tablet for what i wanted a few game reading web browsing came to me with slight flaw in rner of screen where there is a spot that look brighter than the rest of the screen but cannot beat the price i got on sale
there wa a black friday special to purchase this tablet for and really uld not pa this up it is intended for a toddler in time of crisus we do not have amazon prime so really it is useless until the money is spent product itself is fine
the product wa overall worth the money spent love it
the amazon fire work great it is easy to setup the picture quality is excellent and the alexis talk bottom make searching for stuff easy we just got rid of our cable but kept the internet and we have saved over on our bill streaming show on the device is simple but sometimes the movie or show would get stuck on fast forward when it doe that you have to stop the show then wait two sends then resume other then that little issue the fire tv is a great device
i brought the tablet for my year old son it is great for the kid can play lot of game download apps get on you tube ect but i do not like the fact every now and then it make this weird sound and the screen blank out and i have to turn the tablet off in order for it to work again

i gave this a a gift to another and got it back i use it for fb and web also reading and alexa cannot be read in the sun
i love my kindle paperwhite i read it every night before i go to bed if you love to read before bed i highly remmend the paperwhite v the other kindles the others are like mputer screen and it is very stimulating to your brain this is just like reading paper except you do not need a light on in the room because it is back lit but you can adjust the light from fairly bright to very low battery last to day depending on how much i read
great tablet for the price much better than the cheaper brand
this kindle doe not have a lighted screen like the pricier model but it ha a higher dpi screen than the lower model it is exactly what i needed nothing more nothing le i have had no problem with the reader at all so far so i ll give it star
for it worth the user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not a expected
we bought of these for niece and nephew and they absolutely love it the price is very reasonable for the product
purchased a a gift for daughter and she ha not put it down yet this is now her go to device over her laptop mp player or phone to me that speaks volume
i have owned the fire stick for a few month when i decided to upgrade my tv to k and when i did i also upgraded to this fire tv it is a ice upgrade from the stick picture quality is great may be the new tv also run faster and smoother
i bought it for my daughter and she love it it is a perfect size and very nvenient for her age
and never talk back this is the best product out there to demonstrate just what technology can do for the average person and it is nstantly updated every home should have one
i love the touch screen aspect still love the original
great device so far still learning new feature on it daily
i gave this amazon charger only four star because even though it doe a great job of charging my new paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately
excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photo it is light enough to velcro to a articulating stand so i can position the tablet right next to my canvas it is cheap enough to not worry about i love it for the price
i bought his for my son and he love it it fit right in his hand and easy to navigate

this is a fun piece of technology that can link into your home i e hue and nest and even your refrigerator love the capability but she is still limited by what other tech i have in the house you can even have her order your grocery
the hd feature is what sold me on this product along with the fact it a lotmore streamline than the older version that i have
need to have higher internal memory to be better
really neat little device we were an apple only esystem family but alexa is fitting in just fine we used it for listening to music and getting the weather mostly but have since disvered the skill that can be enable through the alexa app we already had a harmony hub and with a little setup after enabling the harmony skill we can now ntrol our home entertainment device with our voice such a alexa turn on apple tv
i purchased the amazon fire tv and placed it on my tv in the bedroom this is a great product and i really enjoy it
i really enjoyed my purchase the tablet is awesome and my son really stay glued to it battery power is awesome
i read the camera spec which is what caught my eye and they are great take great picture but the zoom feature quickly distorts actual picture
when my kindle paper white wa damaged my fault i wa looking for a replacement after reading many review online both from expert and normal user i chose the voyager i have been very satisfied with it i particularly like the pressure sensitive edge for turning page
the amazon fire tv is amazing small portable yet powerful and good quality it is also structured well so thing are easy to find
very nice to hear most of my favorite music only reason i did not give star is i uld not retrieve a popular radio station in another city i wanted to listen to

maybe i didngive it enough time i had it a few week before i returned it i just didnfeel the love i see a lot of potential i wa wanting to ntrol some of my wifi connected device like my thermostat tv and some lighting but it took a lot of programming to get it there so maybe after they do the heavy programming for outside device then i ll try it again

this small little tablet is perfect for reading email and playing mputer game it is light weight make it easy to hold for even long period of time it is low price make it affordable a a supplement to other tech item i keep mine by my favorite chair
i already had an original kindle paperwhite and loved it buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but i am so pleased i made this move i love the new font and the clarity of the screen i love that the kindle me to life when i open the ver i bought a new ver with the magnetic clasp while there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the kindle there are enough change and improvement for me to feel i have made a great purchase which i am happy with i also have a bunch of book from my amazon uk site which i access on my old kindle i uld not work out how if at all i can move book from one amazon jurisdiction to another so this ha proved a good purchase all round

the amazon kindle is very good for kid and adult i remmend this tablet to every one and it is very affordable
i use this device for streaming live tv with no issue
the interface is not my favorite but the unit is fast and responsive it make loading my son is favorite show easy picture quality is great i have mine hard wired to the router so i cannot mment on wi fi speed

one of those thing that you never realize you needed until you actually get it i cannot imagine not having this thing now definitely remmended
i wish echo uld play music at the same time with the same song to other dot in the house
amazon is obviously banking on this item and the amazon stick in all fairness it is a great product with a lot to offer and a good price point i like the voice ntrol feature to easily navigate through your favorite show movie and all i also have a smart home and like the flexibility to ntrol every inch of it from my tv remote too ntrol light door electronics you name it you can also do a little programming and installed kodi to have free movie and such yes i said free anyways it is a great product
alexa is great for keeping shopping list ntrollong my wemo switch and playing music a good a siri for trivia but they still both have a way to go to beme le frustrating liked product so much we purchased the dot for upstairs and it work equally a well
great tablet for kid however do not charge this tablet in your car the charger in your car will ruin your tablet the fire tablet charger can only handle so much current and your car charger ha too much current we uld not power on the tablet after trying to charge our tablet using the car charger it happened to both of our tablet and we had the tablet le than month best buy wa nice enough to replace one tablet and give u a refund for the other i paid more money for a nicer tablet
my old kindle fire got pushed into the water by my cat so i bought a new one it is ok but nothing to write home about kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward too narrow it ll do and the price is right but if you can afford more buy a better tablet
think this will be a great product for my parent it is a christmas gift
i bought this for my grandson who love it easy to understand and lot of great apps to download forget the ipad buy this instead and get the same functionality for way le money
i enjoy this tablet is very easy to use the only issue that i do have about this tablet is it doe not me pre loaded with google i just had to go to youtube to find a video on how to install google onto this device
a family member got the echo dot for their birthday and we played with it for a while and were very entertained so we bought this version because we enjoy our music a bit louder and fuller
the best e reader to use and handle this is my nd one and will get another one in the future remmend this e reader

love this amazon echo answer question play my music even manages light in the house love it
easy to set up sound not bad for a kitchen location use it everyday
i enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
wish you uld choose the response name of your own instead of the one provided
cannot imagine being without a kindle now that i have had one sure beat carrying around book that do not easily fit into a purse
i purchased the new kindle tablet not really knowing what to expect i didnread any review before hand nor did i try the one in store after getting home charging and applying update i noticed there are numerous bright stuck pixel at least it is only noticeable on dark screen i understand the device limitation verse price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe pixel issue at most a i mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately start an update that process took a good thirty minute to mplete upon first boot i went to register with my amazon acunt but it returned some funky error message i tried again and it said the device wa already registered so i wa unable to mplete the setup walk through i m a very technical user so this wa not too big of an issue but i uld see where it uld be for someone that is not savvy with mputers tablet all that said in use it run decently and def better then you would expect a tablet at this price point to run it is not a power house per se but for what it is built for nsumption device it doe everything from play movie music and casual game with out a hitch the ui is realitivley snappy a well pro price ip screen viewable at most angle work well with the amazon e systemns mono sound speaker poorly placed on back of unit stuck pixel out of the box low resolution device registration issuesin closing i would remmend to friend a long a they understand it is limitation
i have had kindles before but they always lacked something that made them practical one didnhave touch another didnhave a light etc i decided after year of not having one to give a kindle another chance this one is perfect it is lite it is relatively fast the back light work great it is easy to read etc i have read time a many book on it than i had on all the other mbined best purchase i have made in year
this tablet work great for my year old son he love it the app store ha plenty of apps i would remmend
easy to use for all age easy to learn and use all the amazon apps amazon stand behind their product pretty well
we bought this for our send grader it is great for her practice math apps her daily reading and fun time too plus it grows with her a she get older and like different game apps etc old stuff is radily erased and new stuff added

wish i would of purchased sooner one of best item
love this reader small light easy to read in bright sunlight seems solid and durable
i upgraded to the kindle paperwhite from a st generation nook i think just about any e reader would excite me however i did my research and decided that the paperwhite wa a perfect fit for me i love the speed of the downloads and the ease of the touch screen i love being able to keep track of different character just by pressing on their name a well a definition of word that are not familiar i love the backlight no more trying to read at night with a glaring light over my shoulder i love the battery life not having to recharge it everyday is awesome i love how lite it feel and the way it fit in my hand soooo much better than the nook overall smaller in size although the screen are the same size i am an amazon prime member and some of the book that i have downloaded and one on my wish list are half the st of the same b n book i find that i am reading much more and totally enjoying the experience of my kindle i wish i hadnwaited so long last but not least i love buying from best buy i love their protection plan and when needed they have always saved u

this newest version of fire work great responds fast to opening apps and speed of browser is quick the lor choice are nice too
i am a prime member i love this tablet very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon not real tech savvy so i need all the help i can get to keep thing simple automatic great clarity of picture data have a tablet and wa not sure about downgrading size old eye but wa delighted to see it work fine at instead of also easier to take around in the smaller size highly remmend especially if you subscribe to amazon and are a prime member great benefit
i wa very dissatisfied in my first visit to this store but this time i had a luck and i had a good client advisor he did help me to find what i wanted
i have several kindles and so this time i choose firetv it is good quality and it work a promise
the kindle hd ha met nearly all my expectation stereo speaker would be nice great screen resolution
we purchased these because we really liked the price we also bought protective case for both and an antivirus program for them
love this kindle it is a great size for travel a i can read it or check my email or play game
uld not be happier for what alexa offer good product
the tablet is about worth what you pay for it but that is what happens when you only pay
great little device very handy to have around the house microphone work surprisingly well must have amazon prime and obviously internet to take full advantage of product speaker sound great in a small room louder than i thought only n that are annoying it should have separate volume level for the alexa assistant and for music when you play music at a lower volume then you cannot even understand alexa until you turn up the volume it is terrible at google search for some answer like what day is president is day it work for others you do not get any answer
it wa a perfect gift for my godson he loved it definitely would remmend this product
good starter product for someone if you use this a lot the g is not big enough

we had recently purchased a home w speaker thruout but needed to add a receiver in the meantime we heard about the echo and thought it might be fun and also provide a mean to have music in our pool room the sound is so good we have decided to not spend a lot of money to run the speaker system in the house the set up wa well documented and had no problem getting alexa up and running in a short amount of time
my late stepmother had a kindle fire that she used to read her electronic novel and my wife loved how much easier they were to read than on the ipads lot of great review of the kindle paperwhite so this will be a great christmas gift this year
i know it is entirely a personally bias but i love kindles and this is one of the best kindles ever
i would remmend the echo to anyone who is looking for a smart home device
the fire tv is great for streaming movie and playing game on
i bought three of these device for my niece and nephew and my parent both have one and absolutely love them so i decided to get one myself this wa my first personal foray into an android based device being a tried and true io devotee with a mac and ipad i will say that for this price point and for what it wa designed to do the fire tablet is great the o and processor make it a bit clunky and it is definitely not designed for high level graphic or photo editing but for basic activity it work great i particularly like the easy to use and transport size i still prefer to read on my kindle but i do read on here a well if you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movie music reading and other medium driven activity ideal for amazon prime member this is perfect
amazon prime wa required in order for u to use the echo the way we wanted
from the beginning we have had issue with our remote
this fit my criterion of a low st tablet that work well
excellent gift ok sound great portability would buy again
something new for my wife she is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tip it small and mpact and easytake on trip so she can read take picture or listen to her music
the fire tv is by far the best streaming platform around amazon ha done an outstanding job
paid for it on sale during holiday uld not ask for better product for the price
i got this tablet for my mother in law she is not a tech savvy person but it so easy to use she connected it to wifi and now life on it during her off time i didnexpect a lot because it wa inexpensive but it wa well worth the money and i will be getting the exact same model for my mother
from a fire stick to this speed difference is huge kodi add on is a bonus
bought it for my mom for mother is day she love it used it for music weather and just in case she cannot get to the phone alexa can send a text to u
wanted a tablet that would fit in my purse very easy to use would buy again
this is a great tablet to purchase for kid who are just learning how to use a tablet
it doe everything it is advertised to do and with some of the expected new release it should be even more fun and useful
alexa is able to pickup my voice from several room away it is able to search for anything that i ask for even reading the news the only thing that wa not mpletely smooth wa the initial setup i would remmend this product
very happy with the overall design and the many option the fire ha a far a the ability to a different apps
all i have used this tablet is for book and it is great for it

i purchased this for my year old to play it wa not a user friendly a described and very slow it keep pausing and freezing up which is frustrating for anyone using it i wa told that i would receive off of the prime subscription however that wa not offered when registering this product it may be good for some but it wa not a good fit for u
excellent product focusing on only plain e readable material with simple option to operate no much fancy but worth a million in term of product worthiness to keep a lot more document with le memory and ha basic internet connectivity option available happy experience with paperwhite kindle
i bought this for my daughter to use i know the regular amazon fire is cheaper but this one came with a bumper a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kid to read lot of book and play great game for free in the end it is a great deal
k netflix streaming is awesome ton of available apps remote work well get kinda hot after a while but doe not seem to be affecting performance would remmend
bought a a gift for spousal unit i have a kindle fire but she wanted one a little larger so the fire is perfect bought a gig mini card so she ha plenty of space she is a happy camper happy wife happy life
after about month of use i can say that my wife and i are very happy with our purchase the amazon paperwhite kindle is exactly what we wanted for reading literature we tried to many time to duplicate the effect with a tablet but found the shiny glare to be too much the paperwhite is easy on the eye and easy to use i did give it star instead of because after purchasing i learned there is slightly more expensive version like more that doe not include the frequent ad were where having to deal with luckily we were able to find out how to pay amazon an extra to eliminate the ad but it would have been nice to not have to deal with it at all i would remmend anyone looking at this product get the version for more and eliminate the annoyance of the ad
faster then the firestick tv version but not a portable still a great product for streaming
this product really helped my father in law hear and have nversations with his daughter who is voice is a higher pitch
i bought this for my year old nephew and he u it a lot

you cannot buy a lousy no brand for this price kid friendly do not you cringe when your wife give her brand new iphone or ipad to the year old download apps and a movie or two from disney and you can have a long peaceful drive in the car with a happy child if you have bought movie with digital pie you can download them to this device for free you need to buy a memory chip to expand memory capacity plenty of free apps on amazon a well we bought several on black friday and have no regret
easy to navigate with plenty of apps simple connection
we have an echo a tap and a dot and love them all
amazon echo is a great device to use at home it help my kid in their home work i am enjoying it some day i am planning to do some automation of light with that
sound amazing and very responsive to question and order
large enough it is not a strain on my child is eye in two day my three year old figured it out great for her to watch her show and play game have not used it much past setting it up
best way to cut the rd saved me over dollar a month
the amazon fire o is not a perfect o but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use i would remmend checking the amazon store to ensure the apps you are thinking of using on a fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issue the size on this one is good the screen is not the brightest hd screen that is available but at this price point i cannot mplain
this is what i have been waiting for this hd kindle is super
bought for my grandson who is four and he can operate it like a champ
amazon echo is an amazing product and alot of fun especially when i say good morning to alexa she always tell a joke for the day and this item is alot of fun and amazing it is great making your music playlist up and being able to have alexa play it when you want to judi
i love this tablet for kid it is so much fun for them great buy
we purchased of these for our kid and they love them
each time that the kindle fire need to be unlocked an advertisement pop up on the screen to remove these ad st an additional fee so be aware that this is the case i have owned nook previously and they were more flexible in usage such a being able to read epub book easily for example
my granddaughter love it work good she is on it all day
exactly what we were looking for backlit display is awesome for reading in bed
really inexpensive and doe everything i need it to for my boy

love my new kindle fire give me a tablet at a great price highly remmend this kindle
i read mixed review on these tablet and nearly talked myself out of buying one but then on black friday the price hit buck temporarily so i bought it i am really happy that i did while it is no where near that of the apple device in overall image quality it put out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of lor and brightness i wa able to download all the main social medium apps several streaming ntent apps and plenty of game to mess around with all for free so far only app ha crashed on me resulting in a restart the size is perfect almost fit in a man is jean back pocket without a case but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended period battery seems to hold up well and the button are working a they should with quick transition and processing i added a gb sd card to store thing later but i never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device the camera work well the sound is decent they make case just like that of the apple tablet for a little a buck bottom line it is not the best tablet but it is a good one for someone who is never used one or just want one for general purpose use i would trust a device from amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablet we bought more to give away at christmas we liked ours so much
i purchased one a a christmas gift from best buy on line it worked fine the first month did not use it for a few week i went to turn it on did not get nothing the lefthand bottom rner say fastbooth mode it is locked on this and i get nothing else did not buy any product protection so i guess it is a mplete loss
i bought this for my year old and he love it so easy to use and navigate
i travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movie or reading on the flight
i have been using kindle for several year now but my old one wa starting to freeze and had problem connecting to the internet sometimes this new one is a great replacement i like that it is backlit and that it syncs to the latest page read with the kindle app on my iphone great purchase
i m a window person this is not window i m still learning i am happy with the size a it fit easily in to my purse but i hate touch item i always seem to touch the wrong area like spelling something i go for a letter get one of the letter next to so it slows down my typing one of the reason i do not have a smartphone all in all it is pretty good i guess i would remmend it because it is the way this world is turning however they do not make a glass protective screen ver only plastic
the amazon fire is a great tablet u cannot beat the price work a good a other way more expensive tablet
very ol device in general and bemes even more nvenient with every smart device you add to this system i think the google home is smarter but it is oler to say alexa v ok hey google
great fun r the little one had to go buy another because it work so well dropped many time and still is doing well
easy set up and use beautiful screen mfortable and light weight no eye strain
i got this to use while i travel because you can connect to wi fi that ha a webpage for signing in like pretty much all hotel require it wa awesome for about two week at first it worked fine with my brand new awesome samsung k tv then a week later the tv didneven regnize it apparently it doe not pay nice with samsung not a huge deal since i bought it for traveling then it didndisplay rrectly on the hotel tv it wa just a tiny piece of the picture and it wa jammed into the top rner and the rest black the next hotel it looked fine but there wa not any audio me on really stink
hi everyone alexa is the best of the best i feel like she know me more and more each week she is a strong speaker for my love of music she know like everything ever i ask her crazy fact and she always responds with something she doe struggle a little with recent event but that will get better with time she is my home personal assistant and assist with managing my calendar in a word awesome
totally satisfied also own apple tv which i ended up moving to bedroom and putting fire stick on main tv fire stick seems to be more open to multiple programming mpared to app store only program with apple tv but in defense for apple tv it is syncing ability with my iphone and macbook are well received price wise firestick ha the advantage
got this on sale and definitely a good purchase very useful for the whole family
awesome for this price i purchased it o thanksgiving for just
i purchased this to watch movie and such on a led tv that doe not have smart feature built in and because of the ability to side load apps just an added bonus you can pair bluetooth headphone to the fire tv but not the stick
awesome product like the layout used roku in the past i really like this one way more than the roku
echo is like having your own personal assistant it is a blast to wake up every morning and finding out how traffic is and what the weather forecast look like
son love this he can do alot of thing on it great quality for the price
it doe most everything the higher priced tablet do the advertising is annoying it is possible to mbine all of the in for stuff you never use or want into one in file

my fire tv device is very handy and actually have of them and am thinking about getting my rd one
i m not going to say this is the best tablet out there but for my wife need it is perfect it doe everything she want to do and more
this is by far something great to stream and the program you can download to it are great worth the money if you know what you know what you are using it for
i have a paper white and honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value i certainly like most added feature but not sure it worth the extra money to note it operates great just not sure it worth an upgrade to the latest greatest
very good product to have at home me in handy and make life a bit easier
i like this tablet i am still figuring out some of the option available on it

my grandson loved this he is and it wa perfect
excellent product i use it for everything especially for music and weather
this tablet ha been great although i remmend getting a memory card so you have no storage issue
you are streaming over the net so occasionally this will cause some innvenience but all in all of the time you can utilize this device just a if you had cable or satellite time to cut the rd and stopping paying these outlandish supped up price

i had bought my girlfriend a kindle fire hd for valentine day she had never owned a tablet or pc before and wa just a beginner at smart phone she became a reader gobbling up over book in the last year this lower st device mpares well in some way but the screen on her fire hd is clearly superior i would buy this again
bought for kid like how sturdy they are my son ha dropped his twice and it must keep on going also added amazon prime which is a great deal
i like this product the sound and quality is good
i had my doubt about the utility of the echo but with amazon ntinuous updating of it skill i have me to rely on it for a lot of thing even mundane task like my morning alarm clock i just tell alexa when to wake me up cannot wait to purchase some more smart home appliance to integrate other stuff around the house

i enjoyed my kindle for year but wa a bit frustrated by needing a light on at night kindle paperwhite is a dream with it built in backlight not only can i read at night but it is easier to read in daylight if the light is dim the nvenient size ability to change font font size and light intensity are super feature

grandchild love the tablet easy to set up and child and adult user griendly
this kindle is so overloaded with apps that i will never use despite what one of best buy associate said you cannot remove any of the amazon apps the apps take up too much of the memory i have an i pad and love but bought this a a backup for work unfortunately it bog down i also do not like that amazon want access to too much info to set up email so i wonuse this for email either i will likely sell it on craig is list for le than half of what i paid for it
i love my original kindle fire but the size and feature on the latest kindle are a plus
great product she is very smart easy to use and display
it wa time to upgrade and i m happy with my choice
easier to navigate to find what your looking for a lot of selection to choose from

i wa pleasantly surprised about easy wa to set up to the wifi and use i use it to play music but very helpful when setting up appointment and reminder
acrding to my girlfriend it is slow but functional for simple thing like web and watching tv i bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied seems like an very good piece of hardware for only suspect amazon keep the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you ntent through their locked down store it is an android tablet but most of the google software you re used to is not there which is the biggest downfall
the tablet seems to be working well so far it is easy to use ha a good volume sound
i purchased this echo a a gift for my husband and he love it he like having his random question answered immediately and we re now looking into purchasing other item that work with alexa
i purchased this for my fianc she read book with it surf the web and watch netflix on it very easy set up and easy to use it also me in different lors
oh my goodness i cannot imagine what i did before i had my alexa echo and i now own dot around the house i am always asking question setting alarm and timer and playing great music work perfectly for me and she understands almost everything say but i have a very distinct clear voice and of urse it is all in how you word what you are asking for love it
i like all the function that it offer and then some
overall i am satisfied with the tablet nice looking screen and decent sounding speaker load of ntent kid and adult nice device
me in handy when staying at hotel you can connect and find your show
i am an amazon fan ive only had amazon tablet so i cant mpare them with any other brand but amazon ha great customer service a lot of great apps the hd is a great tablet for watching movie most game and social medium it not a good a the kindle fire hdx the speaker arent a good the hdx ha more of a surround sound but the hd is le expensive ha a place for a sims card for extra space and ha an ok front and rear facing camera overall it a great tablet for a great price
we got this for my dad girlfriend this year for christmas and she wa able to just start using it right away it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but it not too bad mpared to my tab is it is pretty close when it me to responsiveness if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace nstantly trying to insert ad and sell you thing this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it
