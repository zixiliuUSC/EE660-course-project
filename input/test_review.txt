mpare to the my old kindle this so much easier to read no matter where the place or the lighting
i thoroughly enjoy the product it is really great and the best ever build by any mpany
i got this for my kid and i am able to have parental ntrol over all of them put a time limit on play time they each have their own apps game and book that are appropriate for their age my kid love it and they are learning with this kid edition i get free year of all kid appropriate app game video and book
great over all tablet good build quality but cheap enough for the kid to use loose really a plus for travel install vlc medium player from the amazon app store and then you have unlimited movie option for up to hour add some head phone and that hour trip to disneyland well it is so much more tranquil for the adult
ran out to buy a tablet quickly and wa pleasantly surprised by this one great price easy purchase
the tablet is good for game like solitaire or other app game and of urse for book but for internet or other application it would not be the top choice good buy for the money
this is my rd kindle and my nd kindle fire i bought this fire because of the upgrade ability and my st fire didnhave that before i bought my st kindle i mpared all my choice and found this one to be the best for the money and i love my kindle so much i bought on for my daughter it ha a lot more then the original fire did more apps can be used it connects to goodreads if you do that which i do and it ha a camera it is more like a tablet than just only a e reader a little different set up than the original fire but not that hard to get used to button are bigger for the power and the volume which is a plus
i got this for my year old grandson he love it
this is an awesome tablet for the price kindle got it right
this tablet is affordible and supper useful if your am amazon kinda person i definitely remmend this
family and i are loving it and we have yet had a real opportunity to get into it
this an awesome tablet for kid my grandson never want to put it down the case is great protection from drop
this is our first kindle we are learning how to operate it so far it ha been quite easy and enjoyable to use
bought this for my year old mother who had recently broken her wrist she absolutely love it she is reading all the time light enough she can hold it with one hand
wa not a fan of this product browser are extremely slow
i bought this to help my year old mother along with a dot it is amazingly easy to use voice activated and multi functional it provides extra safety and daily we find more trick to enable with it unlike apps you enable function all free and built in a must have for senior
the amazon tv box is much better than the stick due to the high quality of resolution that it give you you can now have all the apps you need and use thru the amazon box
i like the sound and the wireless capability look good too
i would remmend to family and friend i love it
i bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e reader it is actually cheaper than most of the kindles for that limited use it work fine i do not think i would want to use it a a general purpose table too slow make a fine e reader though a for remmending this to a friend i would but would make sure they knew what i use it for
i bought this for a a gift for my daughter she love it
my kid love this tablet very good quality with affordable price
the kindle fire is a good little tablet good battery life easy to use just wish amazon would add the play store to their tablet but other than that it is a good tablet
it is a very good product and the attention of employee wa very good
help me cut the cable rd easy set up plenty of apps good user interface
very useful very handy best when you travel due to prtability
returned it didnwork like we thought it wa so supposed to pain on the butt
i like the overall tablet what i do not like is the nstant ad that pop up because they want you to purchase whatever app you re using kind of annoying
good tablet for kidsand for adult doe the job
i am late into the electronic age and this is simple enough and is great to use i ask for certain music and it is played
great value doe everything you want it to do i would remmend to those who want a simple tablet experience
the number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that amazon will stand behind it for a short while i am on my rd all of which have been plagued with screen issue dead pixel everywhere if you do not have them straight out of the box great but they can develop and in the great majority of these they will develop it is a known issue and amazon will at least for now replace the tablet at no charge to you a of now they have a zero dead pixel tolerance policy that will likely change if it ha not already a far a operational ability of the tablet it run smoothly and allows for up to a gb micro sd card which i highly remmend a they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware if you buy an gig you ll have about available to you it is a decent tablet for browsing the internet using a an e reader however the screen is not a bright a other e reader or mp player a they say you get what you pay for this is a decent basic option
great tablet for the kid to play game and watch show
so far i like the backlit feature i felt the price wa affordable the battery life is not a long a my previous kindle but it doe a lot more so that is to be expected
very easy to set up and use no eye strain very easy to read on
the absolute best streaming device i have ever used
give access to all streaming apps doe not seem too slow a far a responsiveness much better than the af stick have not had any issue
great gift however i wish it wa g it wa way the angel tree child wanted so thats what she got work great and screen is clear

the echo is easy to use but some feature require a lot of work it is easy to set up for playing music the other feature skill require some study to get the most out of the product after a few month i am still learning something everyday about the echo long learning curve but a fun product
bought a a replacement kindle for my mother in law she love it perfect size for her
easily added apps including google play store not rocket science battery life is phenomenal great for cross untry flight
when used with amazon prime and the freetime app for kid this is a great tablet remmend installing at least gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet ha enough free space to handle video easy enough to use for our year old grandson
purchased this a a child is tablet and i uld not be happier i wa buying it thinking that it would be cut rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car ride and on rainy day despite the low st and unimpressive stats i have been very surprised by the quality the screen is perfectly adequate for game and kid show the parental ntrols child profile setting are excellent and the stereo speaker crush the built in speaker on my ipad air the only drawback i have found so far are power related the battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what i would nsider normal use and the included charger typical usb type take a very very long time to fully charge the tablet i suspect this is the charger is limitation rather than the tablet is and it may charge better with a different power supply i wish that i had purchased two of these tablet at the price they were for sale and i would have kept the send for my own use when on the road
get this and you wongo wrong i love the speed of it and how easy it is to set up my child love the ability to play game esp if you get the game ntroller with it a well

we purchased this for my year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play game and read book without having to use her mom is device she took to it immediately it connects easily to a ghz network but doe not support connectivity to a search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it wa the fire or the network then again it wa running update the camera take great picture even if a child is a bit shakey sound quality is very good a is touch sensitivity
definitely not a smooth a hoped then again for the price but internet browser wa really bad and you cannot add chrome out the box

item wa easy to set up work a advertised very ol
excellent new piece of technology if done again i would have just bought the dot without the speaker then bought a decent speaker and aux jacked it speaker not worth more but it pretty awesome
more than satisfied with my amazon fire tv i previously had a stick and gave it to my friend this product is far superior i love that you can use a wireless mouse keboard via usb port and have the option using wifi or an ethernet cable for network connection so much faster when hardwired i remmend everyone choose this definitely worth the uple xtra
brought a echo just to listen to music while i have my morning ffee in my study but find out it so much more absolutely love it sound good amd it easy to start up
i use it mainly for reading e book and browsing however i wished there were more apps available also before unlocking the tablet ad are shown in the lockscreen if the tab is locked it stop streaming the ad you can pay to disable the ad permanently i only remmend this for basic use if you want to use it for game or other apps i would remmend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy

easy to use and very fast like the fact that you can expand the memory through a mini sd card
this camera is a little thicker than other pocket camera primarily due to the fold out lcd screen the screen is a nice feature a it provides additional stability when in the out position the zoom capability and image stabilization feature are also very good

everything is good but no youtube good amount of apps
my kitten chewed through the power rd that came with our echo and i had to order a new one i wa disappointed that i had to buy another plug instead of being able to buy a replacement cable like most usb cable i bought a rd protector for this echo power rd so that hopefully i wonhave to buy another one due to a destructive kitten
i bought this for my year old son so he uld read book and of urse play game i bought a gb micro sd card to use with it because i knew the gb would not be enough my son love it he read his book and play all type of game and thanks to the amazon underground app most of his game are free while this tablet doe not have enough power for me it is perfect for him
nice product great price and expandable storage unlike the hd version
very large pretty quick processing great picture
work great but need some work with update to understand you and give more answer to question
work very well much better operating system than other cheap tablet it ha a quality feel a well
this is my first kindle purchase and i uld not be happier with it before i bought it i wa very ncerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on but my ncern wa soon expunged i have always read book then a i grew older and my eye sight grew worse i moved to reading on my ipad air because i uld increase the size of the print the downside to my ipad though wa that it would get heavy to hold a i read and after a while i would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device even in night mode to a point even though that wa much better so i decided to try the kindle paperwhite with the new ppi type i uld not be happier with it it is light to hold even in one hand which i do a lot i can still adjust the type size to what i want the type is very crisp and easy to read and i find that i do not get the eye strain that i used to one other benefit to the kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside which can not be said for the ipad another benefit to the kindle is that if i still feel like reading the book for a while on my ipad using the free kindle app my ipad syncs perfectly with my kindle so that it will start on the same page that i stopped on with my kindle so that i can seamlessly move from one device to the other the only slight disappointment that i had with it wa that the battery doe not last a long a they lead you to believe i found myself having to recharge it about two third the way through the book but realistically that is no big deal to me if you are debating on whether or not the kindle paperwhite would be right for you to read on my remmendation is to buy it i do not think that you will be disappointed
i gave this a a gift and have not herd how they like it a yet
we had one and it wa broken so i purchased another one
i had put off getting an echo and now i am hooked on it it wa easy to set up and is extremely easy to use in njunction with a harmony remote ntrol and hub the echo ntrols the stereo television and more the fidelity is surprisingly good for a small unit
this is an awesome product great for watching show and movie
this little gadget give me the same performance a the more expensive model i previously used hope it last a long a my other one is thinner and lighter
i bought this on black friday a a gift for my young son it work a expected for the price that i paid sometimes freeze but for a young child it is perfect
this is my fourth kindle and my send paper white not much to say a it meet my expectation i can read it in any lighting nditions sunlight to dim indoor lighting battery life is great a in the past if you had a kindle in the past or present you know what i am talking about those that have not had one and are thinking about buying one just do it you will not be disappointed i suggest that you buy the ver for your kindle best thing about the kindle is that if you fall asleep while reading it you will go back to the last page you read before falling asleep
i take it everywhere i go it is got me back into reading again all the time if you re a first time kindle buyer like me you ll enjoy this product there are problem with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase
this is an accessible tablet and easy to use great for kind and granma
my kid love it i like it because i get notified of every single game he is playing once the tablet is being register
battery life is unreal so much faster than my old kindle

the echo doe very well with playing radio station and some music there are many artist she doe not regnize a number of artist you have to pay extra for through a signup i wa somewhat disappointed that with more than million item more regular music should be available amazon prime under performs here setting alarm and timer are easy i look forward to interfacing with light and thermostat

i got it because i wanted to be able to use it to download book for llege class it is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when i try to use it i have a g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it i would not think that would cause it to run slow
replaced my old kindle fire with this white paper wa not sure if i would like it without the lor screen and wifi connection however with my smartphone i really do not need those function anymore
do not waste money on the kid program friendly one that is what lock are for
the amazon fire tablet ha alot of feature im very pleased with it
this is the best product you can use for so many thing and it such an easy tool to have around
the backlight is the best part of this kindle i highly remmend doing the paperwhite
easy to use and similar to using a book love it i would buy again
kid love it me with a case but purchased one anyway
the kindle fire is so handy and easy to use we own
fantastic our family ha so much fun playing music asking question so easy to use
christmas present they liked it very much would like
worth for what you pay for basic use is ok
once you figure out it language you can have a moderate amount of fun but the interactive experience uld be much better
i bought this for my seven year old last year wa an ipad and lasted month i uld not see spending on another so i settled for this kindle she love it and i d remmend it a a great tablet for the younger kid and at a great price
alexa is entertaining for music question etc i wa hoping for something more advanced like being able to reminder for an appointment min before the appt is schedule you can set a reminder for minute but only from the time you ask alexa good for oking but not much else
love for old program or program i have missed and navigation through some very interesting program that are not on regular tv on pay per view
bought one for myself and then purchased two more for my grandson great price
great device we use it in the kid room where we do not have a sonos speaker i work well and my yo is able to mmand and receive a response the sound is ok for playing her lullaby and kid song a well when getting her dressed i can find out about the weather and my mmute without missing a beat i have the remote also it allows me to use the baby monitor and turn off the light in her room from afar wonderful and is very entertaining more apps please amazon

i purchased this for my husband a few week ago my husband love amazon echo i should say alexa this is very fun to use and ask question and get answer and so much more only limit is your imagination i think my husband like alexa better than me just joking maybe not lol
great tablet and kid case i just wish it came with kid apps
this is a great tablet it is user friendly and ha some great feature great buy
echo is not only fun but a valuable tool it save time in getting weather daily news my calendar appointment etc
i like the kindle paper white because you do not need is light on to read it
the echo is overall about what i expected except that it is not very friendly with free music site that i use often on other device with no issue amazon obviously want you to sign up prime in order to get music from them it also will not allow you to use spotify is free service only premium you can set up some of the other free site but that ha to be done on the alexa acunt it is just a pain
kindle paperwhite me with back light so it can be reader without enough light source since it u e ink it can be read under bright light moreover it is not stly at all
not the fastest for loading web page but apps run smoothly i have noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory so delete some apps if you cannot access wi fi great for netflix flixter and game good resolution just short of hd but cannotell the difference if hd is chosen over sd when given the choice while watching movie
good sounding speaker using your voice bemes more natural a you use it if you have prime the included music is a great deal
i bought this tablet for my kid on xmas and they really like it
i m not very good with electronics so i wa worried about learning how to use my kindle fire i had no problem at all with navigation of this device i feel it is also fast i wa expecting it to be sluggish i think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain
great service great product for reading in sunlight
i use this device to ntrol light temperature in the living room and it work great also a decent speaker on it own
obviously talking about a budget tablet here so you obviously get what you pay for a always but this is a really decent tablet for buck what i paid on black friday doe all your basic tabby thing and is very mobile great for those kid who feel the need for a tablet but you dont wanna break the bank haha
i have had kindles since they first came out love it
turning page not a easy a the original one whole home page experience not really user friendly and seems geared to just sell you more book
my son enjoy it so much he is so happy with that tablet
it wa a great price bought it for my neiece for christmas and i m sure she is going to love it
this is very easy to handle and perfect for the kid
product work well but you have to put in all the product knowledge yourself and put the thing you want it to know i thought it did all of that by itself but there are thousand of thing you can enable for it to do and it is very sensitive when your speaking to it and also will me on by itself from the tv not an expert yet and maybe those setting can be adjusted
not the paperwhite but for the price i paid work great for my kid to carry around multiple book they need to read for school
i have only used this a few time so far but i like it the lightweight and pretty easy to navigate perfect screen size too i ended up purchasing a send one for my fiancã
my son wa year old when he received this tablet the apps and game are fun and instructional the ver really nakes it drop and shatter proof i have it set on a timer so it turn off after minute of use on day when he seems to be more interested i will let him use it longer other than thats it is so simple a baby can use it
give the tablet to my grandson they love them and would buy them a gift
i love the new fire tv it work great with all my subscription
got this a an upgrade to my kindle touch page turn are crisp the pressure sensitive page button on the side are a nice addition i especially like the self adjusting brightness very happy with the purchase battery life is great so far even with the backlight on
this is a excellent tablet for browsing the internet and reading ebooks and for the price you cannot beat it
this wa a nice upgrade to my previous kindle fire thought would have a few more bell and whistle but i m satisfied with the added speed and added camera
easy inexpensive gift that you can rely on although i would rather have the google play store a the main download application it is worth the money to buy for others
tuck into my purse for on the go entertainment it ha great battery life for reading or gaming
the apps offered wa a expected i wa surprised that it wa heavier than i w pe red
i have only used it one time to download an e book it work exactly a it wa supposed to work just wish it came with the kindle rather than having to purchase seperately
this is a far better product than the fire stick that i first started out with it is a lot faster at everything it doe and it hardly ever buffer i would remmend to spend the extra money and get the fire tv
i brought this to my daugther and she love it she can go on netflix amazon music and youtube easily good display pretty good volume
this is the third i have had to buy they seem to only work for a year before needing to be replaced i have the warranty but no patience for the replacement to be mailed to me with all the form
i bought this for my son and he love it he read and play game on it all the time
love my fire tv mad i waited so long to get it but the best thing that ha happened to me so far this year lol

great way to watch movie able to store picture have not had much time to explore to much
i love the voice response it make multitasking better i uld just say alexa volume it raise the volume all the way the only bad thing is that it ha to be connected to an outlet so it not that portable and it is a bit heavy than expected other than that i love it
this is a great tablet and you cannot beat the price i bought it to use with amazon prime video but i now find myself using it for much more the built in email client work great if you want and do a little research it is easy to either side load apps from the google playstore or install the store app itself allowing you to install the few apps that do not appear in the amazon app store
it a good tablet for that price screen resolution is also good i have purchased for my friend
this ha been a lot of fun to own i have not explored every function but everything i have used work great only mplaint seeing music at full volume pretty much nix alexa is ability to hear the next mmand and the speaker are so capable the next mmand is often to turn the volume down
i have echo dot and this is a great addition super bass for listening to music bb had a great sale
i love my new kindle it is everything that i want my only ncern wa that the store didncarry the right case or the screen protector
there is no difference in reading from a book and a kindle
absolutely love my echo from helping with our shopping list listening to music checking the daily weather and news to just telling the occasional joke you will find yourself talking to alexa every day it is a life changer
this is the best steaming device to run many additional application that will run smoothly

this kindle fire th generation inch is a very good product it work well and best buy customer service wa so helpful
very easy setup and connectivity to my acunts including ebooks and video primarily used a ereader so far like the one handed use and have not noticed glare a a problem
so far we like wish i uld ntrol tv it is lil expensive but seems to work great decent speaker a well
easy too use and a plus for wife to read book being a prime member
a little faster than the firestick and ha k can only do k at hz and k is not in the menu screen can be a little nfusing when thinking the device is entirely k when you turn it on and your tv say it is only p and you have k enabled on a k tv
alexa is a great music ai product i totally love it i bought it because many of my friend have it and i personally would remmend it to other friend
it work well for my daughter no mplaints work well
screen is good internet move fast easy to use and set up
work a it should
just a described
tends to flip out of my screen to something else each screen change at least one pop up ad otherwise it is been reliable so far
while everything about the kindle fire is great it is lacking good sound
purchase went smoothly and the ability to use american express award point at checkout wa a plus
we bought amazon echo for both mother for mother is day they are learning to use them but love them so far
i purchased this a a replacement for my mom is old kindle which wa several year old
i love my new kindle paperwhite love the lighted page and the ability to change print size

i love the amazon fire tv i have so much access to television series and movie
started with the early kindle year ago and upgraded to the paperwhite my wife and i each have one and they go everywhere with u
bought this to upgrade my echo dot definitely happy with my purchase due to the louder and clearer sound that me from it much better for listening to music than the dot
i brought the particular item for my mother in law who is in her late is this tablet is perfect her to play game in large view and mmunicate with the grand kid
my child love playing with the kindle fire it is entertaining and educational
very nice kindle with a great battery life my old kindle wa not able to upgrade so i got the new kindle and very pleased with the product arrived a promised from bestbuy m
no disappointment for this amazon echo great product
very useful to keep my little usins occupied with educational game
it is a good cheap tablet lack in performance but acceptable for price
the only issue is the advertisement that amazon put on the kindle now other than that great product long lasting battery life
if you are looking for a decent tablet for a great price look no further because this is the bee is knee is
what made this even better wa the black friday price on the kindle fire at if they get broken it is not a big of a deal i remember buying one of these when they came out and it wa a whole lot more than it is now that is technology for you i guess great buy great product
great little tablet for a great price i keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading
when this item is charged it work great but it take too long to charge asking my year old to wait about hour no exaggerating is a bit much we have tried to buy a new charger and it still take just a long my niece ha this same tablet and it take about minute to charge once it is fully dead
work well especially when it given for a gift for someone for the holiday
love my new kindle fire easy to use the battery life is amazing
it ha been a great streaming device it very reliable
i got this a gift for my kid and other family then even myself i wish i would have got this tablet along time ago
easy to set up east tie you would highly remmend this product to others
we bought this kindle for our son he is moving up in the high school year and more book are required for reading so instead of buying book or waiting for availability at the local library it wa the smart choice download and read
perfect size for travel hold a lot of book easy to download to
got this for the tank giving and found it to be a good one for my daughter the battery life is pity good for this device and the device itself is robust a my daughter u this tablet very roughly
it is so much easier reading book with this the backlight is good a long a set really low it froze once but it revered
it work well for what i am using it for to access show
i use this for facebook checking email and streaming pandora while in a hotel do not ask a lot from this because at the end of the day it is still a tablet battery life is really good however it is really finicky about the power rd while charging the biggest mplaint i have is it want a credit card even for free apps such a facebook and youtube however you can work around by getting them on your desktop and having them sent to your device overall extremely satisfied
my wife love her new fire tablet it is easy to use and rub quickly and smoothly
most tv is me with all the viewing apps you need but they re not portable firetv ha everything you want plus it fit neatly in your suitcase
i upgraded to have more memory and this is a great little tablet work great and doe everything i need it to do
this is an amazing electronic that help you get going during the day go i simply love it
since we amazon prime it give u a lot of entertainment for my grandson music and video good and small investment
i have older version of the kindle fire and i bought this one to replace my daughter is aging kindle which she u nstantly this one ha camera phone one rear and one front mpared to her one that ha just one rear also the graphic are better and it ha more mg than her old one which is great because she pretty much maxed out her other one she u it to read play game and do homework even can check her grade online all around it is quick to turn on rather than using a mputer to get what she need for easy homework online research calculator etc and a lot more portable when traveling
satisfied with my purchase needed upgrade from original kindle wanted for outside use small and mpact
this is my third alexa and i m very satisfied with it functionality it work well with smart device such a light lock thermostat and so on i highly remmend it if you re in the market for a similar device do not think twice
bought this for my wife to keep her off my mputer when on facebook worked
this is a great learning tool for our year old she love it
very nice tablet durable if dropped my grand daughter love it
love it cheap and good tablet ha no memory but it is ok it doe what i need it to do and my niece love it she is entertained would buy more
this is easy to use and fun to download apps with i spend many hour on my kindle fire reading and playing game and going online
excellent replacemwnt for an older model of rhe kindle
my mom love the kindle fire hd she had the first kindle and it wa time for an upgrade great buy for her birthday present
i purchased this item along with an hd antenna to finally cut the cable price were getting out of ntrol with the cable monopoly this product really delivers all the entertainment you uld possibly want at your fingertip i use it to stream playstation vue after experimenting with all device i feel this is by far the best a smooth a a p but easier to navigate with the remote i also use it to stream netflix a well a some of the free ntent overall an easy to use great product
i love my fire kindle it is great when i go to appointment i can play some game or just read while i wait light weight too not lugging around a bigger reader
i love it because my grandson can use iteasily to play his game
i am an avid reader and have purchased both the first and send generation of the kindle paperwhite product upon reading about the voyage i knew i had to have one although it is a bit pricey for an e reader it is definitely worth it for me a much a i read i believe the new screen will result in le eye strain it is a beauty to look at especially when held next to the paperwhite nd gen and mpared
the best product for the money east to use great lor great feature easy to set up and battery life is great
it is inexpensive tablet the sound is not great too quiet it is not the best but it is good price
if you want a tablet but on a budget go for this
i use this for setting alarm and reminder and for activating my lifx light the set up is super easy and sound quality and volume level are really good too
amazon fire is so awesome i bought two one for myself and one for my daughter who also ha an ipad but now she always ha her fire tablet with her
i bought this a a cheap alternative to an old slow ipad until i uld spring for the ipad pro got it a a black friday deal so it wa more than worth it wa able to add some missing apps that make it even better than i thought it uld be and having amazon prime make it an inexpensive and handy medium device i carry it in my bag at all time without having to worry about it is value cannot beat it for the price
way better than the firesticks i would definitely remmend this item
perfect upgrade from the original fire stick great quality
i liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky also you can it use all android apps the worst thing though wa mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight it wa fully charged i have tried recharging and turning on etc it is just a blank screen and off kind of a ol paperweight hope i can get my money back or get a new one
great resolution easy to use amazon prime give you free movie book and game
great tablet for streaming good internet connection along with a nice display
i admit i am late to the kindle party i uld not understand why someone would get a dedicated e reader when other device uld do so much more i am now nvinced that this is the way to read a book the battery life is incredible and the paperwhite display is so easy on the eye the device is also a great size and can be used one handed without feeling cumbersome
very expensive charger i think the kindle should me with it a doe all other tablet including the fire which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just it is a pretty large charger though and doe not fit in the kindle box with the kindle at all
it is a lot of fun to play with he artificial intelligence is good it make thing easy to do
very fast and no problem loading apps onto the screen great price
christmas gift they were very excited think they are working very well
my kid loved it they use it daily i would remmend to any parent
great product and so affordable easy to operate and download program
i went with the amazon fire tv due to it flexibility to sideload android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular android build if you have amazon prime this is the only way to watch it on an android box i wish amazon would update it apps a quickly a the google play store doe but overall i have no real mplaints
my new kindle is an upgrade from my year old kindle fire a to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more feature i still use my old kindle a it is still ticking but the shiny new toy is fun
nice clear image but very slow and the ad on the start screen are annoying also the search engine silk is not very good switch to google if you can should have just stuck with the digiland tablet a lot more bang for the buck
this is a great tablet for my kid he can watch and play all the game for his age
excellent product great for information and music would highly remmend this to anyone i know star all day
love love love this thing i listen to all my jam in the morning while checking in the the forecast so i always if a sweater is needed lol
i wa a little worried getting these since we have always had apple but wow what a great buy ton of game same a ipad and hulu and netflix access thank god i grabbed these instead of ipads
didnlike it to many pop up all the time do not remmend at all
love the kindle fire perfect size for on the go easy to manage
the echo is a very interesting item that is entertaining and fun
i enjoy getting anwsers to question quickly and verbally no need to sign in can listen to music too fun device
being that i am already an amazon prime member i decided to purchase this to make use of amazon video i replaced my chromecast with the fire tv and uld not be happier
i bought this tablet for my soon to be yr old i wanted to download him some game and a uple apps to help him learn he doe not speak right now and u sign language to mmunicate this tablet work great it is just his size easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case i bought it from amazon it is the best thing i have done for him lately would highly remmend for any and all age
great great quality it is like reading a real book
the paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eink screen i do not understand some of the lack of customization option even on what seems to be simple thing like why cannot i see the time in the status bar why cannot i customize the click zone also ntrary to amazon is claim my pc app doe not sync the document that i emailed to the device the android app doe though i also see their ad when the device is off and start if they gave me the ability to save those remmendations a opposed to read now i might have checked a uple of them out by now still for the money it get the job done and help keep my eye from getting a tired a they did when i just used my phone to read
i love it my son will enjoy it because it keep him quiet
i bought this for my mother so she uld have access to the internet alexa is like a friend you cannoturn off but why would you
i wa looking for a small tablet for the front room to run my sonos speaker this work great just keep it right next to my chair and do not have to remember my phone or ipad
pro amazon prime work on it you can still sideload apps like kodi n not a good upgrade over the original fire tv is worse in some aspect remote button are hard to press mpared to original fire tv remote loses connection frequently and take several button press or removing of the remote battery to fix interface is not a snappy a the original fire tv same interface a the original fire tv there is still no good way to sort your apps or locate the prime ntent that you want voice search seems about the same a the original fire tv alexa add nothing significant you still cannot use it to search in rd party apps like youtube a for video deding in kodi performance is not much better than the original fire tv you will be able to play hevc ntent at p with no problem but p hip software deded doe not play well there is simply not enough power k deding is hit and miss it need to be specifically ded for this fire tv low bitrate low fps to work properly overall system performance is bad when sitting idle the cpu spike up to usage and memory is at usage the o is not well optimized i m not nfident that amazon can fix these issue in a timely manner and their mpetitors are releasing their medium player soon so i ll likely return this while i still can
finding new u everyday it is connected to my nest thermostat harmony remote and hue light yup i m a geek alexa even entertains my macaw with blue while i m at work
functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use
amazon echo is truly awesome better than google home in my experience it is just an awesome device to have around the house highly remmend
we re early in the stage of home smartness but this is a good start
i like the ease of speaking to alexis she understand voice request even in a noisy room and she is able to distinguish between my voice and tv or radio she can instantly fill most request for music and info and i love the stage when you set an alarm i am a bit ncern that she is not loyal to just my voice and anyone around her can input to her and override my music or mmands
this is a great device with alexa and the battery make it really portable it follows me all over the house on the deck in the garage etc
bought a a gift for my kid great device kid love it
this tablet is great i purchased two for child at christmas and they love it
love the kindle paperwhite super easy to use light and easy to carry no screen glare
good deal purchased for my mother killer mother day present get what you pay for
love our alexa just note that you must have amazon prime if you want to get the most out of it can listen to music and search anything the ability alexa can hear is awesome
bought it for my granddaughter she had an older kendal which she gave to her younger brother but not a amazon fire tablet she love it
bought this a a replacement for my child is ipad took her a little while to learn the new o but once she got the hang of it it wa pretty easy lot of ntent and excellent at the price point

i purchased this for our kid for a road trip we loaded some movie prior to the trip and i must say it wa very quiet for once at night i wa able to use it to catch up on some reading nice tablet for the price
gave it to my wife who never used a mputer or anything hi techshe love it and had no problem learning to use it
my daughter love her kindle fire easy to setup parental ntrols
quick with fun fact great for playing various genre of music rather than searching for radio station
solid tablet with good performance wifi connectivity and app availability it doe not have all the breadth of apps that io or android ha but the choice are reasonable most importantly for me this fire hd tablet is a very good web browser ereader and video streaming device so i would rate it highly for these function alone
amazon fire tv is a great product save a lot of money not paying high cable price
wa looking for cable tv alternative this just might be it
i only use it for some apps and that is it it is pretty nice
i wa surprised when i learned of the capability of this device now my husband ha more access to his desktop and i am doing thing which i uld not on his device
we got rid of cable so we bought this i have to say i am pleasantly surprised i do not miss cable at all my husband i love it
my grandson u it all the time it wa a great choice
better than trying to listen to our favorite music on the radio speaker are great and will connect wireless speaker soon should have purchased this earlier will purchase another echo dot for another room great ncept

amazon should improve the quality of the speaker
it is easy to use and so much fun i like that it small portable and ha so much i can do

i like the tablet it exactly what i needed and also easy to use
i have had my echo now for a month it wa easy to set up it interprets both my mmands and my wife is mmands very well and we ntinue to find helpful way to use it day to day
such a great tool i really enjoy it voice ntrol everything we are still working on adding house automation with it but it awesome so far
my kid love it it an excellent one
if you are in doubt about spending the extra money to buy the voyage do not be if it hadnbeen a gift i would have most like not spent the money but after using it i am so glad i have this one
i am still learning what it will do so far very pleased when i ask it something it answer i played christmas music all day long and wa pleased
you can use wi fi anywhere that it is available lot of choice
it is so hard to decide if i should remmend this device or not it is super fast gorgeous image processing when paired up with my sony k however it doe not have turn off button you have to make it sleep to turn it off or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource too simplistic ntroller make it hard to type no option to sign in and out of an app you have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another acunt these can be easily fixed with better software
didnknow how much i would like this but after trying to read on my tablet outside i decided to give this a shot love it i can read in the sunlight or at night no problem and the battery life is great
love my kindle fire so easy to use and amazon customer service is amazing
the fire hd is great for reading kindle book it pretty slow for surfing the web if your looking for a great kindle this is it i would not remmend this for surfing the web

i love my kindle for reading over my ipad now best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle and fast and friendly service this kindle is easy on my sensitive eye and a pleasure to hold i would remmend this to anyone looking for an e reader

my gf got me mine for a birthday present and i just got her one for hers great for international travel it is like carrying a dozen book

i can finally get back to reading thanks to my new kindle paperwhite it is small and lightweight along with a perfect anti glare reading pane this is my first e reader and i love it the paperwhite is a must a i have no eyestrain a i do when reading on regular mputer screen intuitive and easy to use
my wife dearly love mmunicating with alexa she is nstantly asking alexa for information on time weather music and almost everything the internet ha to offer
i love my fire i can do so much with it plus read my book and be online also
bought for my mom easy to use simple and she can load all of her book onto her tablet
i bought this on black friday because of the price i wanted one since i enjoyed using my wife is this one is a little smaller than hers but it work wonderful i have a lot of book downloaded about game it ha gb of memory so it cannot handle a ton of game it can handle those no problem i really enjoy reading on this before bed and when i need to pa time
i love my kindle it never run out of battery used it on a three week detachment and never had to charge it
highly remmend this box best box i have ever had
this wa a great purchase met need of old mom in law who needed a large read space for bad eye
work well enough but is outstanding for the price just be wary of the operating system you uld poetically download an android emulator that would make this a instantly
purchased for my son for christmas and he love it great price
needed a new kindle and this fit the bill enjoy reading on a kindle
highly remmended good quality product very good for streaming your favorite show and movie
it ha all the feature needed for my granddaughter and is easy to use i m am happy with this
had an old kindle and this one blow that one out of the water easy to read in low light and with lot of light kindle really stepped up their game and i m glad i got a new one
i have a pretty fast and stable internet connection mbps down so when i tried to stream some k ntent it kept buffering to the point that it just would not load the video anymore even streaming p ntent had some issue so i used the dedicated apps on my tv to see if i had the same problem nope it worked flawlessly this product just plain suck
i bought this for my wife this is her third amazon fire tablet she mostly u it for reading but she really like the speed and the additional feature on this one she is very happy with it
i have purchased the paperwhite for of my child they all love the portability and the light up screen perfect for travel and reading in bed
my grandkids love it this is the one we bought
it work great for all my need to check my email
the new design mpared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage looked weird when i first got my kindle oasis after i used it for a while hour i felt the design wa kind of make sense when i hold it with one hand right hand the centre of gravity position wa right in my hand so there wa le change that i drop the kindle on my face when i wa laying on my bed it happened a lot with my kindle voyage
we are able to watch lot of different programming
really like the echo use it mainly for listening to music and shopping to do list
it is a neat gadget can do some thing like track item for a shopping list and setting timer that are great i would have expected it to be better at telling me thing like when is tv show x on and what sound doe a cardinal bird make all were met with i didnunderstand the question alexa should be more intuitive than that and should learn and grow a you go along she doe not you also have to ask thing in a way alexa will understand for example you cannot say alexa turn out the light in the kitchen that doe not mpute but if you say alexa shut off the light she will do a you ask i had to start writing down the rrect way to ask her thing so i would remember them again she need to learn and adapt not happening so far
great tablet for the price to buy for your kid versus buying the more expensive ipad
it wa a gift for my grandson it is a great gift idea at a good price
i bought it to help with cutting the rd i use it mostly to access playstation vue service and it work great if i were a amazon prime member i imagine it would be great to access the prime ntent the fire box allows for direct wire to the modem and load faster than the fire stick which is wifi only
great way to have all of my text book in one and read on the go
love the tablet easy to use and loaded with fun for the whole family
lightweight and easy to use or read the paperwhite is wonderful i purchased a a raffle prize for work and plan to get more i have people that have mplimented me on them they love them great item would remmend
alexa is a fun tool if you have amazon prime you can dictate song set timer talk to her if you have no friend pretty fun
this is one of the best present ever can ntrol the entire house with your voice
they are ok for a kid to play game on but i do not like it for myself i will just save for an ipad
this product is very good for little kid to keep some very entertained occasionally
easy to read and great resolution will probably get another for a family member
i wa not really expecting much however i wa pleasantly surprised it feel solid responsive screen is good for the price it a bargain
software is fast and easy to use if you are a amazon prime member this is the streamer to buy
this tablet is for our year old grandson it work out great for him to play game on
great product i have a lot to learn about echo the echo keep learning a you talk to you
my grandson age and had to share a kindle which often left the year old out now they can play game with each other on their kindles thing are quieter now
i bought this a a gift for my father he absolutely love it
while it seemed to work fine the tap doe not have the open mic feature while that can be best for some i bought it a a gift and they would prefer one that listens the tap make you press the mic button every time you wish to mmunicate with alexa which seems to defeat the purpose
used it a a bluetooth speaker and love how i can use spotify with it just say alexa and ask for your favorite artist
alexa tell me a joke alexa play some christian music
purchased for mother in law a a christmas gift and she love it she had a version and she loved she love the better sound picture and speed of the newer version
i m mostly happy but like so many electronics this one ha a huge of built in advertising that you just cannot get away from there is no way to identify the aps you want to see first and it always default the first click to an advertised movie for sell it take many click to get where i want and the voice only work for purchase from amazon everywhere else you have to use the keyboard using click
all member of the family can use it child and also senior
the st wa great and the feature are just enough for my year old daughter i m glad i did not get the ipad this wa a great step up from the leappad
the product work well however you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device alexa i really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome
i have dot and kinda stayed away from the echo because seriously it the same thing except with a giant speaker however i wa super super wrong with how useful that giant speaker is for one this thing is loud at i can hear it at the other side of a story sq ft house like it next to me practically the quality is incredible and the voice detection on it is awesome best purchase of the year
i purchased this for my husband who ha been so busy that reading for pleasure just wa not happening a much a he liked if he d take his tablet to read for pleasure he would get distracted doing work rather than reading for pleasure he now make the time to have some time off and is enjoying novel again good pricing now we are nsidering getting kindles for each of our grandchild too
amazon ha a really nice platform and this tablet is fantastic for those folk who do not to spend a few hundred dollar on an apple ipad mini
it wa given to my friend a a gift i hope he like it
i have had my echo since the initial launch date and i love it more and more alexa doe everything and she learns more and more every month she ntrols my home light thermostat and garage door and with ifttt she can do thing like call my phone or email my shopping list you can create your own trigger her possibility are endless she is also a very handy alarm she wake me up and when i saw goodbye she turn off the light and turn down the thermos
i like the size of this kindle and easy access to internet
doe the job sometimes misunderstands need to buy the right equipment with it
really have enjoyed this item
great tablet for kid and for the price a great value
this table work okay but slow warning this device is ad subsidized for the price meaning you have to see ad
this tablet is great the size is just right for carrying it in your purse or backpack the clarity of the screen is very good you can play game access email search the web etc would remmend to a new purchaser
it is a good tablet for a good price i also love the free trial of amazon prime
the remote work great manually or in voice mode it take a little time to learn to navigate the application but it wa a good purchase
i bought more of these for family and they love them
this wa a gift for my son he enjoys it very much
tired of by buying ipad is because there is just not enough memory look no further basically the same apps in the app store can be found here but even better expandable memory storage
got this for christmas gift for a few people and each say they love this tablet for the price it is great
the amazon fire is a great inexpensive tablet i only wish that it had a more true version of android there are some game and apps that wonwork on the fire because of how much amazon ha changed the android o
bought this for my son for learning and fun we take it everywhere with u work great
a great device that ha a variety of channel and many apps the have a lot of entertainment
it replaces my fire kindle love the hd quality
had an apple tv but a an amazon premiere member wa missing out on a lot of free stuff this is easy to navigate and filled in the gap
mpared to all other similar device this work really excellent
simple and straightforward no set up necessary reading with this fire is a breeze lightweight hold a charge well
i wa hesitant at first about the touch screen but the paperwhite ha proven the perfect upgrade to my kindle keyboard g the screen is responsive and the resolution is crisp well done amazon
great little tablet for taken on my mmute to work
first time with a tablet wanted one for year just to watch netflix and basic game very happy the screen look great and the speaker is loud so far so good
awesome tablet for reading book very easy to use great value for the price
i have found this to be an excellent tablet for child for the following reason free time unlimited you can create individual profile for up to five child and they can have access to a wide assortment of age appropriate apps video and book if you purchase the kid is bundle a year of free time unlimited is included with the tablet along with a shock absofbing case price performance you get a relatively powerful tablet for the price tag if you subscribe to amazon prime this tablet bemes a great travel mpanion prime allows you to download movie and tv episode to your tablet for later viewing this is a handy feature for me since i travel for work and spend a good deal of time on plane n the only drawback i have found is the web browser it is not supported on in flight wifi but the ability to download from prime for later viewing balance that out i will experiment with side loading chrome and see if it work
bought it for a gift i do not know what else to say
quick and easy to set up and work great finally using my amazon acunt for something other than free shipping
i have owned a kindle since the send generation came out but this device is by far the best bang for the money le expensive than the voyage the new paperwhite look crisper than the previous generation feel good in my hand and allows me to read in the dark mfortably without bothering those around me highly remmended
the backlight feature wa what i wa looking for for reading in the dark highly remmended
my kid love it of urse i have not had a chance to look at it is potential for parent use like email seems like a winner
this tablet exceeds it review it easy to use and the screen is great
so having this amazon tablet for about a month or so it ha it pro n let is be clear you are not getting an ipad with amazing spec but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kid or for regular thing like browsing the web email the camera on here is not really the best you re better off using a potatoe ha it is similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day watching video on here is alright you are not getting p when i tired watching video on higher resolution the video would work rrectly i think p wa a little too much but then again uld be my wifi connection but overall it is great for the price really easy to carry around great for trip to keep any kid busy only thing i really didnlike wa the ad on the home screen so for sometimes even lower it a great pick really worth it remember it is a dollar tablet mpared to a tablet it is not going to be the same but it doe get the job down
i love my kindle it fast great pict quality and is so nvenient to use i love using it to watch netflix it worth the purchase if you do not want to spend so much money
upgraded from the fire stick and the picture is noticeably better the quality and speed of streaming is much quicker
fire tablet most most awesome with lot of good image
nice tablet at a very affordable price
very nice tablet and great for kid and being able to set timeverything limit for child is profile my only this is a little different to locate and find apps for downloading without amazon
great tablet for the girl they love it easy to use and great with amazon prime
paid on sale bought two and week later one will not connect to wifi will have to return
the first one i got wa very slow i turned it in today and this one work great
i didnthink it wa possible to love my kindle more but i got the paper white to replace my kindle touch it is even more crisp and doe not strain my eye plus i can read even when it shady or dark because of the backlight i like that i can adjust the brightness too worth every penny love love love it highly remmend
amazon echo is an amazing product i researched and read review and they seemed too good to be true i purchased the echo from best buy for my husband is birthday it wa very easy to set up alexa is very charming this is like having a mputer that answer all your question play music and creates list this is truly a wonderful voice regnition device the sound a a music speaker is great it is a hit with the whole family
a very nvenient and easy way to watch tv program
i purchased this during the black friday sale i m happy with the overall product with the exception of two thing the auto brightness ntrol is not good enough for me it either too bright or too dark i cannot figure out if i m having issue with the lors or something else the nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i have realized using tablet for watching movie is not a good experience
i purchased for my grandchild and they work fine for watching netflix or amazon movie however kindle offer no app for youtube which is a somewhat of a drawback for kid nice to access book for kid to enurage reading also like the parental ntrols so kid cannot make a purchase without your knowledge
i got this tablet on a sale i think it wa it is great for reading my book on or letting my kid play game
we got this tablet for our son to use in school and it is perfect for just that at the right price too
brother in law had one and we messed around with it
i bought this low priced kindle to test a a travel replacement for my pound of laptop i wound up taking it on a month long trip out of the untry and it wa superb for email online transaction like buying theatre tix and finding and making various reservation also outstanding performance for video and music all this for suggest you buy a usb mini cable if you buy one of these superb device yokod
it is amazing i love how loud it play the music
it ha been useful for llege looking up information i do not understand and for downloading book it is also great for downloading apps such a facebook messageer yahoo google google map and the weather it ha also been great for downloading game
the best thing ever getting rid of cable wa due to this
excellent product work great i would purchase from this merchant again very happy with this product would remmend it to friend

this product is a godsend help me stay organized with my to do list keep me out of the rain by providing weather alert it is allowing me to work on my dance move by playing all the tune love it
great sharp picture and easy navigation enjoy the different background option for my book
this portable bluetooth speaker ha an excellent sound which can be taken anywhere unlike the echo and echo dot which both have to be plugged in want to listen to a favorite song just ask alexa want to know the weather report just ask alexa want to know your horospe just ask alexa a lot of fun and entertainment at a great price big thing me in small package
these work awesome product shipped on time i would order again

i previously had a standard kindle the battery would no longer hold the charge i wanted to replace it but be able to read in dim light this feature is great i chose the paperwhite because the screen did not glare like the fire it took some getting used to since it is all touch screen but it ha a few better feature than the original one mplaint is that it sometime jump further ahead than one page so you need to pay attention when moving to the next page i remmend it for someone who want to use it for reading only

i m glad i made this purchase i can now choose from hundred of movie to watch the amazon fire tv allows for storing personal picture and seeking assistance from alexa great buy i do not ever plan on paying for digital or cable tv again

if you need a basic tablet then the fire work it fall apart when mpared to the ipad mini from a usability functionality and available apps standpoint

i bought it for kindle book and wa amazed by it overall feature it kindle with feature of a tab
this kindle doe what i need it to do the camera uld be better but overall i am pretty happy with my purchase

i love this tablet more than my ipad i bought this item for both my son is age they love them they are inexpensive and very easy to use also easy to set parental ntrols they play all thier favorite apps and game watch movie for free i wish there were more option or variety on protective case otherwise it is an awesome product for any age
a simple device with low memory and cheap feel i think if you are going to do a table go with a samsung or so
a lot of the time alexa will me back and say i do not understand the question get very annoying
great reader with incredible battery lifewould def buy again
i like this product i have the fire stick but wanted to move to a faster processor so i uld run kodi work well
a a previous several kindle device owner i read a lot of review many of them put the voyage above it for various reason mainly price or battery charging but after reading the pro and n of both i still decided the oasis wa the direction i wanted to go i uld always return it and get the voyage after all if i didnlike it it is light very well lit mfortable to hold both in the case and out of it the button improve the page turning experience i see no dark area on my screed from the led light it hold a great battery charge true not a good a my previous kindle but i still generally get around week between charge and it look absolutely beautiful i am very happy with this purchase and am glad i purchased the oasis over the voyage it is expensive and that is the major n but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough
our entire family is enjoying the addition of alexa to our home it is extremely easy to set up and make searching for information and playing music just a few word away amazing technology
love my alexa amazon echo would highly remmend
i never owned a kindle before this wa easy to setup and get going it also look really good the text is super easy to read even at smaller font i also really like the button on the side that turn the page because it is a lot easier to flip page mpared to tapping the screen
wanted a nice reader this is it for under
love it my send kindle carry it with me all time a crazy reader is favorite
i wa a little ncerned about the advertised display resolution but it is good enough for my u it is not a sharp a a lot of the other tablet on the market but it only st that make it so i m not so ncerned if it get broken or lost i have watched some video on it and the display seems fine mostly i use it to read e mail and surf the web a this is my first tablet i m still learning about it capability and limitation i have taken only a few photo on it and it is not a sharp a a lot of other phone tablet camera but still serviceable
streaming quality is great and nicely organizes medium from netflix hulu etc
happy yes but all the advertisement are annoying we knew they would always be there it is what it is we are ipad user and it is a step down from the ipad
just getting this kindle figured out so far i like what i see
sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who want a e reader with more to offer
good quality tablet but the only drawback is that you cannot download every app that a normal android user want
this is a great little device for a kid or anyone my daughter love it work simply and keep her entertained and educated
i am an apple fan but i had to see what all the buzz wa about with the amazon firetv i decided on the box instead of the stick because it had more memory and uld be placed in my cabinet i mainly wanted to use it with kodi and it ha worked well so far i also like that it support k stream from netflix setup wa very easy and wa packaged well similar to the way apple package their product
love the kindle and the price wa excellent i would remmend it
work great able to listen to radio watch tv show
i had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the google play store to be installed without that capability this tablet is not very good amazon just doe not have enough apps available i did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store i also notice that this is not a snappy and fast device but i would not expect it to be for for the right situation this is a great buy
daughter love it can download all her app good battery
the amazon echo is a very helpful appliance now my house is smart and with the sound of my voice i can ntrol everything i love it
great for reading while traveling or reading in bed
it seems to work just like any other usb plug in charger
bought for my kid and very easy to use and made homework easier
this is a very nice small and an inexpensive tablet
i wa looking for and st effective solution to satisfy my childrens desire to have there own smartphone to play game i like the parental ntrols to limit certain action and downloads
much smaller and lighter weight than my old kindle menu are easy to navigate and screen are easy to see battery seems to last a long time too love it
absolutely love alexa great sound quality and very easy to use love being able to just ask her question and she can quickly answer also fun to play game
what a great value i thought at first that it wa so underpowered that it would be useless but not so i have bought of them so far and am lovin it
this tablet is useful if you have prime and invest in the amazon esystem i prefer my other android tablet more but for the price i paid for this one it wa a great deal
bought for a christmas gift work great for anything we have tried to use it for great reader
great add on to any home alexia is nice to answer question play your music or about anything you cannothink of
easy to use â long battery life â quality build â quality display
take out the box from packaging connect box turn on the box and watch amazing amazon tv just like that any easier and easier or nvenient it can not get great buy at best but
this tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged it ha survived untless fall from my yr old he love it and it keep him learning for hour
i am extremely happy with my purchase the kindle is very fast and the screen is clear
we cannot wait to start using them this item is a definite must buy
this thing lasted not even a month before it went dead going to try and take it back
this product is a described it is portable and the speaker is loud
i bought two fire tab for my kid on thanks giving the were excited about it and liked it a lot lot of game movie and pretty good stuff for them
present or grandma is birthday she love it would remmend
this is great fun finding out the local weather while you re having ffee is easy listening to your favorite song and changing the volume by just a spoken word is a dream
very nice really enjoy it really like the paper appearance of the screen
overall for the price you cannot really mplain yes it ha directed advertisement on the start screen when you turn it on but again for a tablet is not that bad and the ad can be removed by subscribing to amazon prime which offer feature in itself too
it a nice little set up but it is slow i wish i would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in
perfect gadget for reading purpose reasonable price too
i had the original fire stick and i do not truly see that great of a difference between the new and older version i wa hoping that whe the new version came out i uld really understand and justify why i wa paying more for a new one when my old one worked just fine unfortunately i cannot for me it is not worth the money and i returned the item and stuck with my other one
installed easily no issue so far using it for netflix amazon prime and playstation vue
pretty ol piece of technology very smart and fairly easy to use definitely remmend a a gift i have not fully learned the capability yet but try new thing each day work really well and she understands everything sometimes she talk when you do not say her name so that can be weird
i got very good customer service explaining the difference in tablet and kindle fire is what wa suggested to me a all i want to do is use it a a ereader
it is fun to have but you need a lot of extra to get the most out of it i wa not really ready to buy the subscription spotify and other thing you need to get everything out of it but maybe i ll work my way up to it
no longer take charge from manufacture charger or any other type of charger product did not last very long since had month
beat having cable with a faster processor than the firestick nice
great tablet for the price not really for reading book
really super nice way to watch tv i am a amazon prime member so i do not know how great it would be without prime but with it it is the best way to watch tv period
price is great and my year old love it overall perfect
i used to use a bluetooth speaker system now i use echo the bluetooth box wa stupid alexa is a smart lady i love it the music alone is awesome
this tablet is not the brightest lightest fastest thinnest tablet on the market but i have amazon prime and it allows me to shop do a little gaming watch video and movie listen to music read book and browse the internet i mean really what else do you do with a tablet more that satisfied
you will find detailed review of kindle paper white online i will ver some other general observation if you send a pdf to your kindle email it will sync it to your kindle but the font appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size you have to nvert the pdf to be able to adjust font size you will be able to nvert your existing pdfs by sending a email with nvert in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email refer to amazon setting for finding out your kindle email however it may lose the table or other de diagram from the original pdf so that is a pain varies from pdf to pdf also if you are used to io or android the page turn are not the same like flipping when you tap or perform a page flip it will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page i found this a little annoying but it work if you buy a book online then that might be a better option a it will let you read the formatted ntent rrectly battery usage is fantastic another positive is that the inbuilt light are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience they have setting to adjust brightness a well
good storage and camera for younger child uld have better battery life
it ok but the charger brake easily but overall it the best
i love this tablet it is user friendly and my kid love it i m so glad i bought this tablet
it is nice item my grandchild enjoy playing with

enjoy my tablet easy to carry in purse it wa a great buy love reading from it
my kid love this little fire they can watch whatever movie for number of time wi
i enjoy the nvenience of the size and the ease of reading with this reader
it is worth it to upgrade from the firestick to the fire tv the ui is a lot smoother and easier to navagate
i wa able to grab this tablet for during black friday i wa surprised at how great this little tablet wa for that price i would definitely remmend it if you can grab for that great price
excellent tablet for this price is wonderfull and great performance
my grandson always enjoyed my kindle so when i saw the inch kindle on sale before christmas i knew he would love it
very simple work good for checking email and surfing very amazon intense lot of advertising
it is very easy to set up and easy to use i love the slick look
bought this a a christmas gift for my wife she is an avid reader she previously had a b n nook which stopped working this is much nicer and she love it would remmend for someone who like to read while traveling or simply at home
i wanted to get something nice for my wife and this did the trick i ll get flower next time
a device that get used to how you speak and follows your mmands the thing ha a bit of personality and bemes fun to use
replaced first generation kindle love improvement
it is not a regular tablet but i just use it to use facebook
i love my kindle paperwhite so easy to read anywhere wish the battery lasted longer than it doe
replaced a kindle that crashed so fare everything is great larger screen fast response more storage do not have to charge a often well pleased
the quality of the display is amazing the battery life is fantastic
i love it from the first moment would love to be more intercative
this is the best tablet to get for the amount of money you will spend it ha everything you need maybe not the best camera but i phone for that
still have is long way to go but is good for a smart house will love to get her on spanish lol need way more the idea is great the funtions are to but need more to be a
it amazes me that this tablet is le than fifty dollar is it going to replace an ipad no but it is not meant to it is great for watching hulu and net flix amazon underground is pretty amazing also well worth if you are on the fence about it just buy it you wonregret it at all
the firetv ha a mpact sleek design is easy to set up and also ha the ability to nfigure using cat cable which for my area is much faster than wifi
fire worked fine and wa simple to set up i must add however that the overview menu should have more than a few on line location apps like netflix and youtube it should work a a main menu whose apps include thing like livetv discplayer and even phonograph instead it is pretty much all amazon at least if it wa easy to access it wa amazon aliza wa not all that helpful either for non amazon material certainly not for tv show that are not in the amazon library i think it is a mistake to make me change source to access almost anything but amazon i wa spoiled by my previous old sony bluray disc player that did indeed act like a central menu for everything including amazon i may be showing my age and ignorance here but i bet i have lot of mpany i say kiss for usage even if it mean a more mplicated install
i gave this to my daughter and son n law for christmas they seem to really like it and are just starting to get the hang of it and learn more about it but their initial using of this is all good and they like what it can do
the echo look good it is the same a the echodot except the speaker is much better it is very handy for finding and playing music the app give you lot of suggestion for query and we re having a good time with it
the ntroller and box are mpact the use of device is straight forward but still requires a few day to beme intuitive there is a problem removing the battery ver that allows replacement of battery it wa immovable and i finally had to use a pocket knife to pry it open scaring the bottom of the ntroller amazon should have spotted the problem before going into production acunting for the star rating
easy to install and easy to use i bought the white one match my floor so it look perfect i love the sound quality and the many thing alexa can help you out all day weather music read book the news etc i like to multi task and not having to stop something i m doing to play a new song or find out what is the time in barcelona is super helpful i just use my voice to ask alexa simple a that i m handling my cell phone much le and i love that
we have roku is and we like the fire tv better it work so much better with our slingbox you do not have to go through your cellphone our rokus freeze up frequently but the fire tv ha only done this once so far we will probably buy a send one for our bedroom and move the roku to a guest bedroom
doe exactly what it is made for nice and clear screen perfect for reading
almost like reading a real book do not is crisp sharp and easy to read i have held out from buying a reader for year because i uld never quite get past the fact it wa not a book with this new kindle i do not even notice i am immediately immersed wildly better than i expected
i had a fire stick but i gave it away to a family member i then went to purchase another one but they only had the fire tv in stock so i reluctantly brought it but i am so much happier now that i have a tv box
i never thought that i would need an e reader since i have the samsung note but i am now would not read on the note anymore the paperwhite make reading so much better my eye do not feel tired a quick with the paperwhite highly remmended
bought it for my grandson for christmas and he love it
alexa answer question easily i like tha she is always available it take a while to realize she is not totally like siri alexa will give specific answer to question like what is the weather today or play specific music i like that
work well would buy it again dose everything they say it will
i m so happy i can stream movie from my amazon prime acunt
i do not have any mplaints regarding this product
pretty good tablet very durable and my son love it keep him busy lot of game to choose from educational a well
mom really love it for christmas easy for her to use
this wa purchased a a gift for our grandson he is yr old and ha played game on it almost nstantly since receiving it it ha many free game available to play on it
i use it all the time for television it work quickly and ha good quality
it is a nice idea if you have a need for such a gadget my opinion wa it wa not worth the money mputers and smart phone do mostly the same thing so why have an additional gadget it might be more worthwhile for someone that want to use it for running smart gadget around the house not for me so i returned it
this wa a christmas present for my daughter she read big book very fast when we bought the kindle paperwhiye we signed up for the amazon prime now she read up to book a week
bought this for my year old a a christmas present last year he ha put this tablet thru the ringer and even though the screen is cracked it still work perfectly he love it
i got this for my mom and she like it pretty well over all it is good for the price
the tablet wa everything i wa looking for for my little girl thank you so much for making such an amazing tablet
great device for child impressed by the spec
this wa a birthday present and it wa ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
this is the best tablet you can get under i bought it for my daughter and she is quite happy with it the last kindle i bought wa kindle fire st gen refurbished for which doe not have camera or mic so it wa definitely a good upgrade for a very low price
get the job done lot of free apps available i would buy a send one
my granddaughter ha the kid version so i purchased this one for an older nephew and he life this kindle
i wa very skeptical at first with this but alexa ha beme part of my everyday use very quickly whenever i get home from work or i need to do chore around the house alexa open pandora it super nvenient and the speaker on it are amazing i m really impressed if there wa one thing though that i would have amazon improve upon if they ever release a version is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now which seems to be about foot or so more than foot away alexa wonhear me other than that though this thing is awesome i m glad i got it
we bought this tablet for our son in llege and he love it
brought my old tablet in to my local store and when they said that i would need to replace iit they suggested this tablet i love this tablet a much a my firsdt one easy to set up and use plus the price wa reasonable
this device is awesome all review and produt demo is rrect
the kindle fire is great for trip the airplane mode is easy to find and it is nice having access to amazon prime video
love the product i bought for xmas present they liked them alot
this is a very capable player it is mparable to the roku or appletv there are a few caveat though the device work best if you have amazon acunt preferably an amazon prime acunt it allows you to access the amazon video library download apps and use alexa voice search unfortunately there is an additional annual fee for the service there is a free option but it limit the ability of the device the device also lack true youtube support you re redirected to a website like interface to view video with youtube beginning to roll out k ntent it make you wonder why this device doe not have a dedicated youtube app to showcase the k ability if you have an amazon prime acunt this device work very well otherwise i would remmend doing some research such a looking at the roku which ha a more well rounded set of feature
loved this kindle bought it for my sibling they loved it too and it wa cheap for me
easy setup and use uld not ask for a better product
browse buy a good case a this might slip thru your hand and fall
i love this kindle easy to read outside in the daylight it is much lighter than my previous version i just ordered a new case for it
watch amazon prime and netflix on it for cheap what else do you need from a tablet that sts under
i enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that i can go to the internet from the kindle
i have nothing but good thing to say about the kindle the backlit screen make reading at night very easy i am a heavy reader and the battery still last for week
not very user friendly in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough however a great tablet for a child to play with
easy to use and please send me a gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash work too
alexa is very useful at home it help you to play music set up time checklist to do etc
great tablet very good put together and easy to use greatest for gaming
i purchased this kindle to replace my original kindle that is of the same format i do not believe it wa called paperwhite but it the one without the keyboard at the bottom it ha been a great kindle however i have always been disappointed that it did not have a back light now that i have a back light i have no idea how i managed before even reading before bed with the lamp next to the bed on the back light make a big difference the extra resolution is nice but not really a huge thing when you re talking about text on the screen the battery life is definitely reduced when running the back light however not to the point where i have to charge every night i ll still likely get several week of battery life before needing to recharge overall if you re looking to upgrade this is the kindle to get the back light is a huge upgrade for me it help reduce my eye strain which is important to me
i love alexa music book fact game christmas story giving a gift also
i bought two of these tablet for my twin boy bday they just turned year old on aug they really like them also the graphic are awesome i really would like to get the purple for myself
great tablet easy for a child to use price is right and size
i purchased this in order to stream playstation vue it work very well for this amazon also offer k ntent one of the few place you can get it for now
the best product we have been pleasantly surprised
i have had the kindle keyboard with it is lighted ver and now i have the new kindle with lighted ver i will briefly mpare them and then list the pro and n of this ver in mparison the kindle keyboard in the ver is much heavier than the new kindle in it is ver the new case doe a much better job of securing the kindle a well it is no longer hinged only on one edge but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attache to the back of the new kindle the lighting is about the same between both case but where the old case lit the screen from the top right rner the new case light the screen from the top middle i feel like the old light mechanism wa more durable the light bar on this ver is made out of very stiff thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that ntained the light on the old ver it also hinge open instead of pulling out of the case and the hinge feel subpar the light on the new case is le angled and tends to get in my eye more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did all in all i still like the new case it fit the new kindle very well and doe not increase the size or weight very much the leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it look sleek on the kindle i will be keeping this case pro mpact case that look very sleektight and secure fituses the kindle is battery so no additional power is needed provides adequate lighting across the entire screen n lightbar hinge seems very cheap since i only received this today i cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the kindle is battery read more
i bought it a a christmas gift and the person enjoys it
price is low but o is lacking unlike other brand it doesnt me with a decent charger to refill battery you have to charge it overnight
i picked this up for my led tv that came out a few year ago this is great because i can use the apps like wwe network hbo go etc i got it on sale for buck deal of the day well worth it

the kindle is very great reader and remmendable for people
amazon echo helped me to make my home smart apart from turning on and off the light one can enjoy alexa mpany
i m deepy invested in the apple esystem so i approached using the echo a a just something to experiment with now i understand barry diller is statement that eventually jeff bezos will be the richest man in the world and for me it start with the echo i use it from the funny morning alarm to bedtime when it manages my night time hue light scene i prefer to listen to music through the echo and not tie up my other device i have ordered several dot and am looking forward to being able to use a more serious speaker for music now that i have been sucked into the amazon universe i have abandoned my apple tv and replaced it with the fire tv becuase of the alexa voice ntrol the kid use alexa for homework and even my beyond ol teenage son admits it is a worthwhile technology i have a lot of fun with the ifttt recipe it beme a bit of a hobby and rather than having a technology where you blink your eye and it is out of date the best thing so far about the echo is it just keep getting better with more product integration skill and ever expanding ntent i remmend getting one soon so you can enjoy the new stuff a it me along
i absolutely love how u an switch from dif acunts
my kid really enjoy the alexa i will buy more of these in the future
it would be nice to have full app library but it doe what you need
i enjoy using my kindle it is lightweight and i can just take it out and read while waiting for the bus or at any time the kindle is easy to use and easy on the eye and it is perfect when reading outdoors
my old kindle died after almost ten year upgraded to this new model i like the upgraded feature and it is still easy to use it is the best on the market if you just need a reader
i like the ncept of the product i m still learning how to use it but it seems that it may be to pricey to really get the full benefit
use for amazon prime video netflix and directv now would be star if remote ntrolled volume and tv power
so far so good my son love it for his room and give him ability to watch netflix
really surprised at what this little tablet can do i am starting to use it more than my ipad easier to take on vacation smaller footprint more mfortable to hold while reading book online
wife really like it work great like the front back camera
i wa disappointed that she cannot connect to you tube she is otherwise great you have to be very specific when asking her something when i ask about news in a certain region she just give the general news which may have nothing about the specified region
i would remmend this device over the google chrome cast apple tv or roku product based on the ability to jailbreak the device it is very easy to jailbreak and well worth it with the step by step instruction available on the internet
this is my send kindle purchase the first is still working fine just not backlit or paper white the clarity is great good size and lightweight for extended reading no bell and whistle just easy and nvenient reading

work a advertised will be interesting to see that additional apps that amazon roll out for the fire device
over all the product is good battery that are supplied seem to of been dead but other wise very good
great tablet work very good and the price is cheap
good built in speaker but would love the capability of connecting to a bluetooth speaker like the dot
this is a great product but i wish we uld get local tv
link up with up local library good to read in sunlight can check web and email close to having a tablet but have to figure out what apps work with amazon
movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it
wa looking for a nice size tablet when a great price so far they love the tablet
used it for day and the screen froze time the kindle just wonswitch on had to restart each time and sometimes restarting wonhelp it is clearly defective brought it to a bestbuy store to exchange but custumer service wonreplace it asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there wa none then they said they uld give me store credit and i would go line up in checkout and order a new one since i got mine on a disunt i had to pay the price difference this is ridiculous they would not order a replacement for a defective product unless i pay more got a refund in the end even though i liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange i guess purchase with disunts are not protected
this is one of the neatest product on the market today fun for the whole family
bought the kindle fire for my granddaughter she saw the one i purchased for another granddaughter and asked for one for her birthday i like that it is much more than just a reader
great product i use this for shopping list which everyone can add something a they use the last one a well a music
we bought this for our kid when we were traveling to the caribbean on vacation this wa the perfect lifesaver a we were able to load up with lot of apps to keep them occupied
the amazon fire is great for our year old to play some game
easy to use and worth the money lot of movie and other feature
it responds better to my husband voice than mine but it is been helpful and very easy to use
i bought this for my yr old granddaughter she love it it ha many game and other game can be downloaded she is also able to watch video and mom can set parental ntrols to limit time and usage
great reader no glare love my ipad but this is great if you do not want the glare from light after using this product it is not a quick a an ipad
certified garbage lesson learned about paying attention to review fire tv box and remote wa packaged like new even included new battery after plugging it in it would only show amazon logo and unknown boot on screen cycled power several time and even tried to reset using remote button no dice i read all the negative review before i purchased this i chose to take the chance so i m angry with myself but very disappointed with amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished let alone certified a if that mean something
alexa is such a great addition to our home i would remmend to anybody
if you enjoy reading you will not find a better device excellent price for a product of this quality
i love mine so much i bought my grandkids all one
great lightweight easy to carry and great picture for reading
great for the price i just wanted something to surf the net from my uch and this is perfect i have not tried using it a a reader yet
i like that it ha parental ntrol and a curfew on it what i do not like is the charger it seemed to have a short in it or doe not charge fast it is a slow charge but she love it and it doe way more then i expected she is able to download book she cannot use the internet because of the child mode it is a great tablet for child and adult
great product if you are already a heavy amazon user bought one for my parent and they love how they can stream free movie from prime
great easy to use great picture great price awesome
this basic tablet wa just what i wanted for our gift tree it wa a good buy for the quality and price the tablet ha a good reputation for reliability
i love this kindle tablet it speed is awesome and it a great device for young child
i am purchasing this tablet for my younger usin a a starter tablet but we will see how well it hold up with his rigorous activity and game playing
well since i have to use up at least sixty character in this review i can say it wok
i bought this for my year old is birthday it wa the perfect price range it is actually very well suited to a young preteen he can game and read book without issue
i bought two one for my son and one for me great tablet at a reasonable price
great product and hold a lot of memory sometimes it is hard to get a movie started
i can do a lot of thing on my kindle i used to rely on the mputer for
i can not believe how nice this fire is for the i paid for it i would not spend a lot of money on a expensive tablet when this one will do most everything the big dollar one will do
i got the amazon fire hd for reading and other activity it wa very easy to set up netflix worked ok on it it mostly work well but there are limitation to the apps that are available i tried it out for a while and then returned it for a samsung is
this is well nstructed for kid my biggest reason i do not like it is it asks for a credit card for a kid tablet i suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a amazon gift card for game purchase
easy to use this device and the sound is great we ntinue to find new way to use it
i m very please with the tablet have not had any problem it doe everything i need it to do i would remend it
i purchased my fire tv to replace a fire stick and i am very happy with my decision so far i have not experienced any lag and it is so nice to be able to plug an ethernet cable into my fire tv
kid friendly great appschild can learn many thing with this tablet
good item quality lor and visual would buy another
it wa amazing everything wa perfect and it came on time
i hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet mostly because i have never had a tablet or e reader and wa not sure i uld figure out how to use it even though this table me with virtually no instruction there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive even for a total novice now just about a month since my purchase i am loving this tablet so much and am so happy i purchased it the price break made it an even sweeter purchase
battery life is good clarity and lor are good still learning how to navigate
this item is a thing of the future you can littetly operate you wireless mponents using this debice
look no further fast processor great ram expandable storage turn your tv into a smart tv
i just bought a k tv so i wanted to make certain that i obtained a medium player that delivered k ntent i looked that the roku apple tv but i settled on the amazon fire tv because of my previous amazon acunt and the price point the device is quite elegant with a small form factor the remote is equally small and minimal in form but quite effective the mic work great to interact with alexa just for fun i found it interesting that alexa will answer a question mparing it to siri but siri doe not reciprocate i like that amazon ha deal to allow hbo go streaming on it whereas my sony tv wa not allowed to thanks to some deal between mcast xfinity and the network other apps such a youtube and sling also work just fine on the app it also syncs up to your amazon acunt and on some song lyric will appear on the screen like some sort of karaoke service i thought that wa a nice feature i wish there were a few more option on it to customize loadout or app management also at time the device would disnnect from my n network and connect to the g band for some reason forcing me to manually reset it i wish it would automatically connect to the higher band but it is a minor mplaint the bottom of the remote can scratch easily a well so do not slide it across the ffee table a i am apt to do overall this is a great product and i have no regret purchasing it
good speaker great interface with amazon i use it to turn off and on light play music talk from room to room it is handy
this product is awesome point blank it still need improvement in the nversation ai in order to be able to have that extreme edge over the google home but overall i love the home automation that is mpatible with the product most importantly how well this behaves with vivint
we love the voice mmand remote easy setup kid and adult can operate it
device make an excellent personal internet access machine some apps do not load on the device but those are few and far between great music player a well a good interface with online streaming service such a netflix no need for a dvd player for the kid with this
saw this on tv decided to look into it purchased it and loved it
this fire wa easy to set up and easy to use for email and internet
this tablet is a great gift specially if you have lil one they will be entertained for hour
good purchase suit our need at a reasonable price
the fire hd is a nice improvement over the model first the extra ram make browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear it is not on the same level a apple ipad or samsung galaxy but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablet
great for using at home a an alarm and finding thing
this is an awesome tablet for the price work like the expensive one for le
best servives grate people and good prises im very happy
i have remmended this product to everyone i have talked to it is easy to navigate and and allows me to mange my tv time
this give me so many app and avenue to watch and stream directly
the one thing i had an issue with is i would leave my amazon speaker on playing since it is always listening but at time it would just cut off by itself without my mmand another issue would be if i m on the phone and what i m saying may sound close to the mmand acrding to the speaker itself it would automatically light up for me to mmand it to do something do not know if i like the idea of it listening all the time
great product excellent for small business kid etc good on the go
ok tablet can do what i need doe not stay charged long enough tho
great device very functional love it will remmend
i had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but i would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it when the kindle paper white came out i decided ill give it a try i love reading in the dark with it and that it look like the page in a physical book i also love the word wise it help to review word you didnt know later if you want growing your vocabulary
had a smaller version love the bigger screen use this product more than a mputer
i had one of the first kindles that came out and really liked it it wa stolen so that gave me the opportunity to get the newest version the paperwhite i really like this one more than the other one since now i do not have to keep a light on and still be able to read
amazon always ha great product i would purchase again
i already have one of these that i had bought for christmas i bought this one for my grandmother because she love to read just a much if not more than i do she love it and the user interface is super easy to use so she ha no trouble at all working it she tell me all the time it the best gift she ha ever gotten if you are thinking about buying one do it it worth every penny and more
this tablet wa so easy to set up even this old technologically challenged grandma did it without help i am able to load many book on it it is nvenient and easy to handle
the echo is great besides information it will handle smart light it is learning new thing all the time
if you want the mbination of a kindle for reading a well a some of the feature of a tablet this is an excellent value for the price i like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book i am reading and my email or other web u it seems like the battery discharge rather quickly mpared to my other kindle i often keep this one plugged in while i am using it
i have had a few different kindles since they were introduced and this is my favorite model by far i love the way they lit make it much easier to read in the dark and outside versus reading on a tablet or a phone the kindle last for month or a few book on one charge and is such a great way to have my book always with me on the go
got me reading again love the merlot ver this one is the smallest of all the kindle product i believe and that is a big reason i picked also the lightest i believe battery life is forever two negative point are the amazon logo in the ver and the fact you cannot do inverted text black background white text those point dropped it from to star for me still highly remmended
i decided to buy the amazon firestick tv after already purchasing firestick based on the fact that firestick tv box is k quality and it doe not disappoint if you have a better picture quality tv definitely remmend the higher quality firestick tv to get the best picture possible
perfect for home automation and wireless entertainment
this ha been one of the most valuable accessory i have purchased from best buy in a long time i do enurage everyone to find a use for it
i brought this for my kid and no regret make sure you buy a case protector along with it
i bought it in thanksgiving it very cheap and ha got good feature for that
this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download book
bought this even though i have an ipad and an android tablet i wanted this so that i would not be easily distracted with other apps the only thing is that i wish i uld inverse the lors for night time besides that it ha a long battery life and is great for reading book
it is slippery u cannot hold it it always slip and lot of ad definitely not good if u do not like advertising
item work a advertised need to understand apps to get full use

this is my first fire and i am very satisfied with my purchase
the bargain tablet of the century performance nvenience and decent screen run all the apps you need
i wa a little skeptical on this at first especially with the price tag to it but after buying it it is such a ol piece of tech to have at home or your office i have one in both place my girl like using it at home to have dance party and they re learning the voice mmands pretty easily i use it at work for music trivia and there are so many other ol trick it doe that make it a must have
good solid tablet for the price doe alot of thing
excellent device very fast especially when connected to ethernet
it so perfect for my niece she love it going to get another one for my son
i think that my amazon tablet doe all that i need for it to do handy to have when traveling easy to operate
i wa totally stoked about this product because i wa purchasing a new home however the property fell through and i returned the product but the little bit i had it i loved it
alexa is a blast and a lot of fun voice regnition work well and the microphone pick up speech at quite a distance i also purchased a dot boy have decent sound quality
the fire will do anything that the i pad will do and is at a much more attractive price
battery is nice screen look amazing uld not have asked for anything better
this is a great addition to any technological home we do not use it all the time but we use it daily it ha a hard time regnizing my location when we ask for the weather but we can ask for our city weather and we get it we use the note taking quiet frequently for calling out what we need for grocery it play music that we ask now we must get some of the switch and plug for ntrolling your light and home automation that will be a while but it is still ol to know it is there a an option overall this is a ol toy for the whole family
good and helpfull i like it get it it good my kid love it
this is so much better than trying to read on my phone my eye and head do not hurt from reading on the kindle like they would on my phone great product
echo is learning everyday and it u daily the fact that is it bluetooth is awesome
alexa is now a great friend upled with prime music it provides nstant entertainment
purchased fire stick along with fire tv and tv work better
we have various version of the kindle and this one is great the screen quality is amazing and i think it make this the best kindle paperwhite and the price is great got it for le than a with a best buy member deal
alexa is awesome she ntrols the light in the house keep me up to date and dressed for the weather i enjoying disvering what else i can do with her ask her who is the fairest of them all
so ol after playing with this for a while now i would never spend the money on an apple for what i am doing with it
the fire tv is much faster than the fire stick it is super mpact it ha a better antenna so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick it also support k streaming and ha more memory than the fire stick this mean gaming capability the only downside are you must sign in create an amazon acunt which is free it doe not me with an hdmi rd which is required for use and it doe not have expandable memory overall it is well worth the price and i would suggest spending the extra and purchasing the fire tv instead of the fire stick
great graphic for price mpared to other brand
for the amount of money it is actually a good tablet
alexa is working well and learning more every day
work and regnized a lot of mmands but doe not work when the music is high
i bought this fire tv to try it out at my business i didnwant to pay for cable or satellite so i gave it a go i m happy i did now i do not have to worry about anything i have everything i need right there from music to movie it keep my guest happy so it is a win for me
love my amazon echo very responsive mainly use it for weather and music answer any question i have soon i will connect it to some light for a start
light to carry and good picture quality this wa purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in american sign language this product wa easy to maneuver for someone that wa not use to a tablet
need to get rid of cable one step closer great ntent
i find more way to use echo each and every day from home automation to streaming music
purchased for my younger child to do learning game my last one purchased wa for a year old and she love it very durable
i bought this tablet for my wife she u it every day it is very usefulto her she u it in place of a mputer she watch movie on it the graphic are excellent
i purchased this a a temporary tablet after my old one died now i have no desire to buy a different tablet any time soon for the price it is great it doe everything that i require a tablet to do especially after paying the on amazon to disable ad well worth the price
we go this for playstation vue but with prime there are so many option
this e reader is easy on the eye light weight ha an adjustable back light and ha a decent storage size it only doe black and white so be aware of that if you have book with picture or image
i love alexa she ha made my home smarter i am able to use her skill to ntrol my tv thermostat and sprinkler system
i already own a firestick i decided to buy this one for my k tv due to it supporting k i moved my firestick to the bedroom tv great product
my daughter wa and had never owned a tablet she loved it she u it nstantly
the fianc wanted one because she is a heavy reader and it is easy nvenient and portable wa a only probably the best money i spent too make her happier
love this product take clear photo easy access to internet ton of apps to choose from everything you uld need in a tablet is here
this is a very basic tablet but the price cannot be beat i bought mine on black friday the amazon fire only support the amazon app store so you will not be able to access the typical google play apps normally available on other brand tablet i normally just use this a a kindle device
kindle paperwhite is very good for reading i have bought i think it very good both for personal use and gift
reliable price efficient device easy to use for all age
great little tablet for around the house it is only wifi capable but it is inexpensive bfs i use it to catch up on email recipe calculator game and so much more when i just do not feel like starting up the desk top mputer it is portable and nvenient so happy the bestbuy employee jessica lee suggested it she wa awesome to think i only came in to buy a movie
work great for getting info and weather good for playing music also
loving this item it can play all of my favorite music and i got it on a great deal i love best buy deal
it wa an excellent purchase from best buy i would remmend buying this if you netflix
perfect addition to our kitchen and cannot have picked a better product for our home
i love it it doe everything i want cannot believe how great it is
i am a gadget guy and a big fan of tablet and e ink reader they each have their specialty and purpose and e reader are still best for reading i have bitten a kindle supporter from the beginning this latest model only further improves on that reputation the back lighting is awesome and the touch screen is amazing the clarity and definition is outstanding i wa do excited waiting for this to be released and wa very pleased with the result
for the price this tablet is an absolute steal i have never had an ipad to mpare it to but that is only because i have never wanted to spend hundred of dollar for a tablet
bought a tablet first had for a month hated it replaced it with kindle other people remmended love it
i have used this for almost a month now excellent reading experience it ha adjustable brightness too doe not strain the eye even when reading in the dark
i have bought tablet for my son and didnopen it after i received it because it wa a birthday gift for them and when they open it on their big day of the tablet didnturn on the screen is just purple i m out of untry right now and will be back on august and i emailed best buy geek squad and told them the whole situation but nobody responded very disappointed it wa a surprise gift for my kiddos and of my son wa really upset that tablet wonturn on let is see if best buy read my review and take some action
great gift and excellent product for anyone easy to use and user friendly
will never buy a amazon tablet for game again it dosent have google play and the game take forever to download
i am reading positive review and wish i uld say the same best buy is great so this is not a reflection on them just our experience with the product we have had this product for just over one month and i have had to contact amazon support perform factory reset to get ntent to show up and the device is poorly designed a the sd card pop out nstantly which mess with drm and doe you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the internet to fix it we are returning and spending the extra money for an ipad will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience if you just use the device for reading maybe this is for you but trying to download information to sd card and actually being able to access it ha been beyond frustrating a well a having to do factory reset so ntent owned already purchased on amazon would show up on the device in the library
good job amazon great product easy to hook up and start watching movie sport etc
very easy to setup and use like the picture or screen bought gave them a gift everyone loved them
bought this a gift for my wife she wa not sure about it in the beginning but now love it she u it for shopping list and simple search she even connected the christmas light and u alexa to turn them on and off always learning about new feature and so far we have been happy with each one
i found this product to be faster the other mpetitors product
let is be honest i didnthink i would be really satisfied with a tablet but i thought this would be good enough for web browsing email and the occasional youtube or netflix video so i bought it this tablet ha exceeded all of my expectation this kindle fire is better than the one i paid for a uple of year ago and mparable performance to my ipad it is more responsive and ha an expandable microsd slot for more memory the only detractor are the weak speaker the camera only adequate for skype not for taking picture and the placement of the volume button on top would have preferred side button like almost every other smart device however i liked this so much that i m going to get another one for my teenage daughter
the echo wa easy to set up it also wa easy to learn how to use it wa a gift for my wife and she love it
this is my send echo purchase my first wa the original echo for my home and the automation feature aside the sound is excellent alexa is response is better than any digital assistant to date and the ready access to prime is nvenient this is all of that and portable and rechargeable a well additionally the inclusion of bluetooth and a headphone jack is amazing
great product would remmend it to others to buy
this is my send kindle love size of screen and it is super light great camera
easy peasy to install and operate remote ntroller
fabulous little tablet for the money light and zippy a few limitation on available apps and external hardware but if you just want something to access email read a book or stream video this is the way to go i needed this a an early december birthday present for an older lady whose old tablet had quit working she love it also best buy came through when amazon wa already out of their own product before it wa even december
easy way for my family to stream music and video over our speaker apps are a hassle a lot of the time and limited storage capacity
bought it for my daughter work great store personnel did an excellent job
excellent product i love the back light on my kindle
we use this a a hand free speaker in the kitchen it is great for using pandora and amazon music the only downfall to this product is that to take advantage of the many skill alexa can do you must memorize the specific prompt word for that particular skill besides that it is great and i remmend buying one
this wa a gift wa able to talk to an associate and wa offered the amazon tablet at a great price i m so thankful for best buy and it is knowledgeable sale associate
great price for this easy to use tablet for younger kid easy to get it going
i bought this for the ease of downloading for travel this is amazing i would remmend this
this is a neat little device but really not that good for much i am sure it will improve in the future but i would remmend waiting it out
i have not really used mine that much therefore i cannot rate it to it fullest so far it been good
love my amazon echo doe all sort of really ol thing
simple to istall very easy to use blend well with the der
i bought this tablet for my year old daughter she love it she stream movie and is able to use her social medium apps without a problem for under it wa a steal
i rarely watch live tv so watching my favorite tv program on the fire tv work better for me also great for watching netflix
the music wa good however alexa is voice wa inaudible most of the time it uld not meet our need so we returned it
received this a a gift i do not use it much but family love it
the amazon echo can be used for so many different reason such a to do list shopping list and creating a smart home i love it
great device work great and so far no issue
fun apps for kid along with some great educational apps and video
this device doe some pretty amazing thing from running your smart device for you to making your grocery list
good device except you cannot find some apps you only can get it from google play store instead of amazon app store you have to learn how to side load apps if you want to install apps that you cannot find from amazon app store
i love my echo the alexa app is great i miss it when i m not at home so i bought a dot for work
got this for my granddaughter she love it wa a hit at christmas good first tablet
love it it is an awesome item and my mom love it she wanted this and is not mputer savvy so she is more familiar with it since my daughter had one
this is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf product it is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plug great sound and portability
i wa skeptical at first but i love love love it
this is a great product for someone who want to switch from paper back book to electronic medium great to read while outside or on the beach
i did not receive any instruction on how to begin using my kindle fire i started using it before i came across an important note that i should charge it before using it i plan on utilizing the geek squad to get me started i have tried on my own but get frustrated when i cannot get what i m looking for in order to operate it i feel nfident that once i learn to use it i will be satisfied with my purchase
i use my echo to play my music and ntrol my hue light which work difficult to understand at first but not more than a minute cannot solve
i want to get more automated item to hook up with alexa
i have both the firestick and amazon tv i choose to to get the amazon tv for better streaming and live channel thus far i am satisfied
the tap is essentially a smaller version of the echo that ha alexa capability like echo doe but also double a a portable bluetooth speaker you do need to tap it to ask alexa to do anything but otherwise it work the same a echo i prefer the echo but the tap is great for llege student and those who just want to supplement their echo
this product is great and would buy for all my room in my home
awesome price on black friday great tablet for reading and searching the internet ha expandable memory slot which is great
this is a good little device well worth the money facebook is hard to read but overall a good product
great for teen agers and easy to use and set up small enough to take a you travel lot off apps to choose from long battery life a well would buy again and would reckomend this to every one even at a great price a well
love the sound quality and knowledge of alexa the whole family really like the way you ask alexa question and the answer she give the choice of music know no end we play game and listen to the music day in and day out really love the echo
my son love playing with this tablet very easy to keep him entertained
it ha been nice having the echo love it bought dot for g daughter
bought this for a plane ride to watch some youtube is and twitch stream would buy another
i needed a tablet for my kid and this wa only plus a memory card and they had so many game we were able to take a hour road trip and they were entertained the entire time a far a android tablet go this one give the most bang for the buck that i have ever seen
this provides better sound than the built in samsung tv sound but not a good a a full surround sound system i liked the fact it had a digital audio connection to the tv and it me with the cable
i am extremely happy with this purchase it is everything i expected and more great price for a beginner tablet
i only had a chance to download one movie and i wa impressed with clarity of pic
mainly use for music and to do shopping list inquiry about basic information are answered with accuracy but more mplex question describe the limbic system etc are not answered sound is average if you are looking for in depth answer this device will disappoint you great for fairly mmon stuff
easy to use and put kpdi on it now i can watch movie whenever
this is my first tablet and i m excited about learning how to use it
i m glad i finally got one hard to get around christmas time
ol asking it question and getting accurate reply
love being able to access all the apps we stream from like the voice remote can be a real time saver especially when you cannot remember which app the show you want top watch is on
i bought three of these tablet for my grandkids for christmas my wife had ne and she rally loved it
uld not ask for a better tablet to read with doe exactly what is say i have kindle unlimited and read all the time battery life is excellent
fixed alot of issue that were mplained about with the
device is preloaded with many friendly apps that are easy to use
i wa debating whether to get the stationary alexa device or the tap and decided on portability it is been fun figuring out how to phrase request but with a little trial and error we re on a roll i use it for play list at work alarm clock announcement by dan marino and news brief it is surprisingly sturdy but wish it wa waterproof so i uld take it with me while fishing
good like the larger size screen and able to increase font for easy reading
i use most of amazon service prime kindle music video alexa and this is the best mpanion to access all service seamlessly this tablet also ha great feature expansion and performance
work great make a great gift
it is a really good product it doe just what i needed for a great price
excellent gift for my grandkids they love it and play with it all the time
this is my third amazon fire tablet and it is definitely an upgrade from my two year old inch fire hd i love that it ha a card slot and both front and rear facing camera
alexa is a great device make thing like playing music and information so nvenient the skill that can be added are entertaining and helpful a well
easy to use i would remmend it to anyone whit kid
i always need a nice reader with better battery power
we have hooked up to the whole home and it will take care of anything we ask it work great and doe so much
i have a hard time navigating the menu and use is not intuitive
for it being a amazon tablet it doe everything you need it to do on a general point
easy to use and great for the kid lightweight and easy to travel with
the tablet is easy to use the storage is not great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice have not found any problem with it yet reasonably price
great price fantastic gift i would remmend this for a gift for all age
this is a great mean of watching lot of program
the unit is well made and ha ton of feature for child six year and over wa amazed at the low price and how easy it to handle even for a six year old
this is a great little tablet for people who want to learn more of the modern world simple program easy hook up to wifi and an easy touch screen the only down side is the lack of memory which is ok since this is my kid first tablet
i purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it she really enjoys amazon free time and i really like the way amazon software work
programming echo is time nsuming i still have not gotten everything programmed that i would like we do not use it a much a i thought we would either
this item is not good ok no use for my kid
lack a lot of the info so readily available on google home
it is the perfect tablet for a the price doe everything a more expensive tablet doe
doe all basic function of a tablet hardre user may want an ipad
my daughter love her kindle paperwhite and read on it every night
only st me at black friday good deal way cheaper than an ipad of which i have several this wa for my young kid the only knock i have ha to do with the you tube kid app for this v apple product on apple you tube kid allows you to speak your search you only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young child who cannot read or write
this wa the nd fire i bought for my daughter after the st i purchased at christmas stopped working after only a uple of month the screen froze up and would not ever reset and uldnt be saved she doe use it everyday so i guess we got our money worth of use out of it for the dollar price tag
i have firetv box and fire stick and love them both the stick buffer a bit sometimes but the box never doe for u i use it with playstation vue and it work great
i am unable to connect with ipad pro which limit one of the primary reason for the purchase i will appreciated remmendations to connect the device
great kindle my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way
great product and great service from bestbuy online
for the price it is perfect doe all the basic well and if you break it you wonbe heartbroken well worth it
i purchased this item for my daughter and she love it easy to use beautiful picture and a great price
alexa ha been a nice addition to our home device i originally thought i would use her more for playing music but am finding that i am using her more and more every day from checking the weather traffic to work changing the temp on our nest news checking local hour for various store the list go on and on very pleased with my purchase
purchased the kindle paperwhite because i got tired of reading on regular tablet and ipads those device really do strain your eye not so with the kindle the display is crisp and amazing the battery life is astronomical highly remmended and for the price it is a steal
it is a fantastic device really fast super quite and i never have any issue with the remote staying paired like i did with my nvidia shield so i highly remmend this device
great value my kid love it and use it often really help them with homework
nice and nvenient tablet for kid i like that it ha parental ntrol so parent can nnell what the kid do and download on it only downfall is you cannot get all apps on these
our echo ha beme indispensable in our house besides all of the question we normally ask alexa we also use it to turn on and off our light through the wink hub and stream music from spotify we love it
this product is easy to use and take along with you
i like that it is lightweight and it ha the built in light
so much fun to use also streamlines ordering and other task great for listening to music a you think of it
got it a an xmas present for the brother in law he love it easy to read and play with
i purchased the fire tablet basically a an e reader however after finding out how to install the google play store it is much more nothing speedy or top of the line but what would one expect for the price no regret
mom love the tablet easy for her to use she u it for facebook reading and some of her game
i bought a kindle fire year ago and enjoyed using it i always wished for more storage and better connectivity this new model ha both and i can use with my amazon acunt
easy to use and simple tablet for the money cannot go wrong
wow say a lot we are already prime member and love the normal benefit but this box added to the list offering a huge selection of thing to watch
i wa not expecting much with this product but man i wa surprised how well it worked i added the charter app and i am able to watch live tv on it
love using this for music will sometimes have to repeat the mmand or time before alexa will understand and then do e mmand that wa given
will suggest this tablet to my friend yes i would suggest this product to my friend i will purchase some for christmas gift
basically ha almost the same ntent a a roku would provide but in a much more clunkier menu i can get a better amazon menu layout via the amazon app on the roku also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via fox sport network f that is not happening you can add the channel free but in order to watch any ntent you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeat the whole purpose of adding the app for u rd cutter there is no way i am signing back up for cable or satellite i wish f would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such a hbo and showtime do it is a thumb down for me
work wonderfully charge quickly
in my opinion it is very slow for internet use good for our yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculum which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed our internet connection is great with every other laptop and mputer in the house
this is a great product would definitely remmend this item
the fire tv doe not display in k it process in k but cant display k this is because of the dumb design it still ha a hdmi port you need at least a dvd port to receive a k signal you wont be able to tell until you hit your tv display resolution there you will see it still displaying in p
for home automation this thin really doe it it can do a lot of thing and also is very simple to use
bought this a a gift for my daughter and it wa a good buyshock proof and great educational apps for kid in it
i find this product to be very efficient for several reason on an everyday use the more i use it the more i like it
a little pricy i m not a fan of the onboard speaker you cannot tune it it is preset and is a little flat and mono in sound otherwise i wish it would be able to easily be paired with more home item
this device is a must have if you have a amazon prime acunt just say it and she doe play it and it getting better worth buying
great tablet for younger kid bought of these a christmas present and the kid love them they can play game download learning apps and watch show on them
this streaming ntent box pack a lot of punch for it is size very responsive to your mmands whether using handheld remote or voice activation very easy to set up register and use some of the ntent is a little misleading a you need to look for the prime banner otherwise you have to purchase to watch which wa a surprise for me a when i saw all the selection i wa excited about all the offering some of the movie i wanted to see were noteven available but there is still plenty of other stuff to watch i ll give it a year trial to see if it really worthwhile but seems ok so far when you bring music ntent and free day shipping into the package
doe everything we wanted great value for the price
totally worth the money ha all the apps i use on a daily basis
great item cannot wait to add on and join amizon prine
so with that said i cannot mplain i purchased this so i uld have something inexpensive small and uld throw in my purse or pocket to read school book on the go i own an ipad air i paid for that so it is not fair to mpare the two of urse amazon doe not have the apps that apple ha if you re looking for something to read book on but to be able to hop online from time to time on a screen bigger than a smartphone this is it the screen resolution is not top of the line the audio is not great but you can watch amazon video youtube and other streaming service on this table if you know the capability of this tablet then you wonhave your expectation set too high with that said mparing this to any other tablet this win with the low end st of this if i had the finance i d find an under privileged school district and buy these for them the feature of setting these up for educational time for kid is great if you have not already exposed your kid to ipads i d remmend one of these i think the fire would also be good for someone who is not a techy i do not even nsider the camera on this they uld have left that off of the device but i suppose if you purchase one of these for grandma she can use it to skype the grandkids i just see a lot of possibility for this because of the feature and st
awesome within budget tablet great display battery
it wa easy to se up but the recipient wished it ha an actual manual that you didnhave to download to print a py she ha yet to use it outside due to weather at this time
wish it had an open market for other apps and not limited to amazon
i am so happy with this purchase i no longer have a cable or satellite bill to pay every month save me a month easy to use once you learn
i purchased two of these during black friday for my kid love using these
bought for our toddler so our kid would not fight over my oldest daughter they love them
it is a good little tablet but just a little annoying because of the ad on the lock screen to make u have to pay more for the tablet to get a tablet that doe not have the ad on the lock screen is kind of ridiculous so for that reason i only gave it star it is a good tablet doe what they say it doe but do not like the fact that you have to pay extra to get a tablet that is ad free
bought this product for grand child and he really like it kept him busy on long trip
must have if you have amazon prime easy to set up and easy to use
while i purchased this item a a gift for my son it proved to be one of the best choice i uld have made he love alexa and the ability to ask her whatever seems to be on his mind echo is a wonderful mplement to information availability and information technology to better our life a great gift and a most useful item

if you have had a kindle you know it is more like reading a book page some will prefer it enough to have this device my elderly mother u the version of this that connects to cell tower and is able to download her own book from her subscription service she had trouble removing them once she hit the download limit i have this version if you have wifi i think this is the best option if you have the money i do not see much purpose in the upgrade and i do not know who want a bigger bezel the touch work fine my only mplaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should i had to buy an adapter to have book read to me the text to speech is very good and realistic

gave a a gift and ha been truly enjoyed by their whole family
my wife and i wanted our child to still enjoy the feeling of having an ipad so we got the amazon fire kid edition it ha been awesome i love the way you can set limit on the tablet so they re not glued to it all day long kid mode is extremely beneficial

best e reader ever love the back light and how light it is my bos suggested the paperwhite after she saw how much i love to read and i have to say it is the best gift i uld have ever bought myself if you love to read you wonbe disappointed because it read like an actual book the only difference is it is not bulky and you can actually adjust the backlight a needed i also love the fact that i can read at night without having to turn on the lamp to see the letter you can also adjust the font size so you do not have to strain your eye try doing that on a regular book over all i cannot say enough good thing about the paperwhite i totally love mine
i have the firestick in our bedroom and this in the living room work great very fast for the price it well worth it
i have been using a kindle fire for a uple of year it wa a good tablet until the screen went black best buy replaced it and i uld not have been more pleased i enjoy reading on my kindle fire hd more than ever try it and you ll buy it
small enough for a purse and work great i would remmend memory card
my kid got this to replace their ipads and have not missed a beat
bought this for my year old and she love it it is perfect for her and if it break it wa not an expensive device well worth it
great little streaming box better than the fire stick
great product able to connect a lot of different device
love it every one should have one easy to use but need other part to set this up to light in your home
having the echo is great especially for playing music searching web love it
great tablet for the price got it on sale for to my surprise it ha bluetooth
i love it am a big reader and enjoy having the fire beacuse i get to read and surf the internet and is small not to big
love this thing it is very useful and a lot of fun to have
just got this for christmas so i have not got to use it a lot cannot wait to learn more about it and use it more
i love it it is so easy to use it and i can safely everything i want
love that i can get answer to history question but especially love the fact that it play any song that i ask of it
i know many people who have a kindle it free up using the cell phone memory so i bought this one for the amount of storage it ha a well a the st of the item thank you
i have had several kindles they do not last super long before breaking and love reading on them my only mplaint is that they are not very durable and tend to break after about year of regular use being that they are not super expensive it is not a huge deal but bit enough to not earn star
got two for my kid for christmas they have been great so far they hold a charge and there not slow i bought two off brand tablet last year of lesser quality and they didnlast very long these have been worth every penny the only negative is that you will have to eventually expand the memory
love it very happy with purchase doe everything i expected
easy to use and lot of feature would remmend this item
went from paper white to fire for lor and audio love the fire
i wa amazed how little it st to get a kindle fire these day i passed down my ipad mini to my son because he u it a lot and i just wanted something to watch netflix and read book the big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership it is noticibly slower than my old ipad but for i m very happy with it
â i needed a tablet to keep at the hospital during overnight stay so i decided based on price to get the kindle and i am pleased i did for only the bright picture sound storage and ease of use is well worth it
and now i say cheap but not in the pejorative sense good price and with great functionality many u reading surfing the web game love it all
i cannot say how happy i am with this purchase no worry of lighting or holding a book open all my book stored in this kindle which open up lot of space in my home easy light to carry
would love to see more siri like functionality however this integrates extremely well with my nest thermostat and with my philip hue lighting system while i am still learning some of the in and out of the amazon echo i think i will be happy for a long time to me
my yr old daughter got this tablet from santa for christmas so far she love it a little too much perhaps i only use it to manage her acunt permission and so far have not had any issue with it software and hw not quite a refined a apple ipad product but what can you expect at the lower price point
nice tablet for game and keeping up on social medium
after purchasing a smart tv looking forward to using the built in apps i disvered that the one offered were notup to par i went back and talked to a very knowledgeable associate heather she showed me why i wa having trouble with the streaming on my new tv and suggested getting a streaming device after listening to her explain the difference between them i decided on the amazon fire tv and she wa spot on no more issue and the speed and picture are great thanks so much heather
the kindle fire is a great product will do so many thing would remmend to anyone
i never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet i prefer watching show and movie on my tv and i prefer reading actual book a opposed to a tablet however when i learned that best buy wa selling this amazon tablet for on black friday i knew that i had to get my hand on one even with the aforementioned reason for not getting one i uld not argue with that price i think it is a great starter tablet it may not have the largest screen or hd quality but then again i do not need all of that the quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price gb may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card i very much satisfied and remmend this tablet to anybody especially those who are curious about tablet and have not purchased on yet
like this a lot just wish they would me with more instruction on all the thing that can be done on it
absolutely love it battery life last long and great screen with the back light
amazon tap is one of my best buy this year so far the only thing that uld make the tap better is an upgrade so you do not have to tap every mmand that would make it a star device
got this for my little brother and he love it and it is so inexpensive im not super worried about it being roughly used for a kid
verified purchasei got the kid version because this is mainly for my toddler i know i know yes i did get this for my toddler he is always interested in the learning apps we get on our phone for him so we figured this would be perfect
i would remmend this product to almost anyone it is small and user friendly the installation wa easy and hassle free
doe what is needed can watch both amazon and netflix on tv
average tablet for general use i still like apple better
i am using my send kindle and this third one wa a gift for my year old mother in law very user friendly
i liked the screen size and easy to read book at night the battery ha a long life the outer rcase uld be stronger because ncerned about durability
i would remmend this product it is very user friendly it is useful for the entire family i am not familiar with other product like the google home but i would like to bet this is way better
this is a fantastic tablet i take it to workall the time
first rate high quality
i have a kindle voyage and wanted another reader because i read a lot i decided for the paperwhite a it is just a tiny bit heavier than the voyage but just a good i highly remmended it
i would have given this product star however the only thing i do not like is the limited amount of local storage space gb other than that this is honestly my favorite piece of tech that i have ever purchased the performance and speed is send to none especially when connected to the internet via via hardwire ethernet cable i remmend this product to everyone thank you
i use my echo to ntrol my automated home and luv it
got this on sale for buck i think my i phone is faster and work better on most thing but uld not beat the price serve it purpose for occasional use and game
great tablet for kid to play game and watch video
grandkids love alexa great for so many thing everybody should have one
purchased a a gift very well pleased best buy is great for all electronics purchase
the echo is certainly able to answer many question but it is inferior to the google home we bought both and use them side by side and the home is able to retrieve answer or information that the echo is not on a somewhat frequent basis example are question or request such a how many calorie are in a pop tart searching for certain song or type of music and calculating time and distance between two city by car the home wa able to do all of these thing while the echo wa not the home also tends to provide information beyond the direct answer to your question while the echo doe not the echo definitely ha superior sound quality but i m not sure it is worth it
i love the kindle voyage my favorite feature is that i can read while at the beach it is also very lightweight and fit in one hand
i got it on a pretty good sale so i feel it wa worth it the sound is good i like that it is portable and rechargeable i think it is best if you have a prime acunt so you have access to the prime music
great very easy to use clear picture my yr old grandson is happy
i purchased my voyage yesterday it looked like i scratched the screen today and i contacted amazon directly and they replaced my voyage under the warentee i did not need to go thru bestbuy turn out it wa food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is amazon back up their product i do not think it worth for there is a weird screen disloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting nditions but it barely noticeable in normal light it look quite normal due to st it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite but in it defense the voyage is much much lighter thinner and more responsive and the page turn button are seamless over all this is a mighty nice product side note i own a nook glow light plus which is cheaper and look nicer and ha a great feel to it a well nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the pperish lor back and white textured front the voyage is attractive too but i think it will sell better if it had a two toned lor like maybe a white front and a lored back side voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same feature i just feel amazon can afford to make their product more stylish also best buy doe not seem to offer and real choice for case on their kindles and tablet i had to order a ver at ebay
bought of these for christmas present and one for myself other than not allowing crunchyroll app it doe everything quite well internet photo storing and editing movie email game great app store vers all the need and mostly free love em
new kindle is so much better than paperwhite kitty hair always used to get stuck around the border of the paperwhite not a problem with the voyage
work great easy to use and small enough for travel the only mplaint is my first one would not charge after yr of use
after receiving another extremely high cable bill i decided to cut the rd the amazon fire is awesome we subscribed to playstation vue which ha an app on the fire that you can access we can also access our amazon and netflix acunts right from the fire great product wish i would have done this sooner
i felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader
it work for just what i need it to reading i also love how the camera work the game
this thing is pretty ol my nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it hold up nice job on the heavy duty case it is a little slow though
not enough free program even with a subscription to netflix etc you still have to pay for most movie show
very good item very happy with it will buy again
bought this item for my nephew love it remmend buying the rubber case also
love this item it really is amazing what it can do
what a great product easy to set up and a great assistant
i love the amazon speaker it ha a voice activated speaker named alexa and she is full of incredible task i connected her to my light and i can have her ntrol them from anywhere in the house
i only bought this a a travel mpanion when i fly it wa cheap and functional
how have people lived with alexa so long i have had her from the beginning now i m buying her a gift she now ha capability to call and message play jeopardy keep shopping list play music every week she get smarter and you get and email to hear about it can be an interactive device with other home gadget too ie nest and lifx light so st efficient go buy it today all others are imitation
i wanted to buy a tap when it wa first released i have several echo is in the house but having a portable alexa enabled device is awesome unfortunately when it wa first released the tap uld not be operated hand free i held off purchasing one because i wa afraid amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature earlier this year amazon enabled hand free mode and it work almost a well a the echo despite having fewer microphone sound quality is very good it is a small speaker but very capable battery life is excellent this is currently the most flexible implementation of alexa and i remmend it
wa very easy to set up and use ha been a joy to just ask alexa to play my favorite music and even tell joke highly remmend this product
a christmas gift for my granddaughter it wa a big hit
i upgraded my mother is rd generation amazon kindle fire hd to this new one and she like the display being bigger to and is much faster
i love the new kindle the backlight is fantastic
a nice upgrade from my original amazon tv fire the voice mmand feature ha been flawless a great purchase
in an effort to simply and cut down on the number of book i shelve and store i bought the paper white kindle by amazon i had previously owned a fire and it fatigued my eye after reading and like my book ended up on a shelf my parent swear by their kindle paper white is and so i decided to give it a try i love it easy to read easy on the eye i can read it in bed without keeping my wife awake super lite and the battery last forever
it is a very basic laptop it is a good price it fill all the basic need
i got this tablet with high expectation given it is from amazon however it wa disappointing in many way and it will be returned first off despite of the small screen size it is heavy too heavy to be used a a book reader in bed the deal breaker for me wa that there is no way to connect a vpn using the regular android setting the option ha been deactivated and acrdingly to the tech support it is not available yet but it will me surprisingly still acrding to them none of the new amazon table on sale have such support apparently amazon doe not believe that open wifi at ffee shop supermarket airport offer data security risk for the tablet user on top of that the amazon version of google play store ha a reduced number of apps and the one i wa interested in are not available and the cherry on the top wa that only after min of small usage i wa still trying to find a way to connect to my vpn the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive too bad i really wanted to like it
the fire tv wa purchased for our living room and we primarily use it for watching playstation vue and netflix we already had a fire stick for my daughter is bedroom which we have found to be painfully slow the fire tv is a mpletely different experience great performance and mpletely worth the extra money over the fire stick
gave this a a gift for christmas to my daughter is family they loved it
i bought this for my son to have access to netflix and a few game although i think the parental ntrols are too mplicated i really like the tablet
work great
entertaining and fun to quiz and listen to music is great
excellent machine for child easy to use and download
what a fun toy this is it wa easy to learn to use and if i needed help the online user is guide is right there purchasing book uld not be easier and there is no hard py to dispose of when you e done i wa able to check out a book from the public library with little effort with so many low st or no st book a well a current best seller there is an endless number to choose from you can use the search function to search by topic or title i like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that i know i will enjoy my kindle voyage for a long time
just like reading a book except you can highlight and read in the dark so great
the first worked fine for three week then stopped took back and got a replacement this one lasted almost a month again took it back and wa told i had to deal with amazon found out thru amazon webpage that unit simply froze up and how to reset it wa upset that store associate knew nothing about the product had to research everything myself
i would not change any thing on it at all it work very good
great product love bb great product love bb great product love bb
it is awesome the only bad thing is you have to pay for unlimited music
my son absolutely love this thing very durable and me with a great warranty
i bought this for my year old granddaughter had some issue with the charging cable took it in and best buy replaced it because i bought the year replacement product it nice because i can use a card and she can download whatever game she want

nice little tablet cant go wrong with the price can watch movie browse the net all kid of apps and can expand the memory
love this speaker the quality is great for the price
this ereader is honestly the best that i uld have bought for my first one now i do not actually read often but wanted to buy something to help me read what i do have within my kindle acunt i wa stuck between getting this and the original kindle thankfully i got this mostly because of the textured screen and backlighting the backlight is what did it for me i read review about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark and that is when i would be reading the most if i had seen how hard it really a to read it would have gone back immediately the weight is a little heavy for nstant reading but nothing to really mplain about the battery life uld supposedly last week but apparently i am a bookworm i have to charge it every other day with max setting one thing i am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia the note and the highlighting it tell you when others have highlighted other section of a book i am reading a well im not sure if this is in general a feature of the kindle product but it is extremely useful overall i think this is a great ereader for beginner and bookworm
use it everyday sign up for amazon prime and watch almost anything
this product is perfect for reading alongside my mputer while i type
the amazon fire reminds me of a cheap older android tablet from year ago the camera is horrible the screen is full and i d rather play with fire than to use the amazon fire im returning asap

i have purchased tablet so far a gift i have gotten great feedback on all purchase the price wa affordable and easy to operate for eight year old
i really like the feature the size and the price but i wa a bit disappointed with the lack of speed
i love the new kindle i have a third generation and the new feature are awesome
this is a great product my yr son is mpletely hooked onto it the only change i would say it making the interface a little easier to use
excellent streaming device offered at a reasonable price
these are great device for the price good performance and awesome warranty having the freetime is also very nice a app purchase are le frequent
simple but effitient i bought it to use mainly a a good st benefit music player device the fire ha some limited apps for the purpose i get it but it work fine a i had no tablet yet i disvered i can use it for other thing yes it work fine a a tablet and i am learning to love it
good product easy to use just to pricey but worth it
so i wa already not too pleased with amazon is choice to only include an essentially useless charger when purchasing a kindle hd and caved to ordering the fast charger so it would not take hour of non use to recharge for you do not even get a full charger just an adapter to put on to the rd they already gave you amazon please just charge the real price for the device instead of settling to slowly rip people off with essential accessory this sort of thing cheapens your image and erodes loyalty
it is a great device that let you do stuff without getting off your uch or leaving your bed my light and fan can be turned on and off by my voice i set my alarm daily just telling her to set it and the time my tv can be ntrolled with my alexa you can use a an interm system if you have in several room which i do the only mplaint i have is that sometimes i have to repeat myself a few time for it to pick up what i am saying but not enough to worry about b
i bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely loved it
i like this and the price is right enjoying it now
doe everything i needed and morei use it a a travel mpanion and the size is great
unfortunately we did not purchase one of these to keep for ourselves we gave both of them away to our child at christmas
this wa remmended to me good product can avail amazon prime and will automatically get hook up have an access to it
this wa the best purchase i have made in a while the text quality it excellent and the back lighting is a real plus
i love this product the screen is bigger the bumper is stringer and my granddaughter love it so that is all that matter
this work almost seamlessly very little buffer and run all apps well
my kindle fire hd meet my reading and web need
i love love love my fire tablet i wa surprised by the ease in using it
so far i have not had any trouble with this tablet only thing that suck is this i cannot text from it if anyone who is an app for it let me know thank you
seems like a great tablet for my youngest daughter the parental ntrols are nice and the battery life seems decent too
kindle fire hd is great love the the size and the graphic easy to use and navigate perfect gift for mom
amazing for travel or being able to read when your partner turn out the light
we purchased this echo a a gift for my son and he love it setup wa easy and he is having a lot of fun with it really make a good gift
easy to connect and set up provides access to a lot of medium alexa work great

i bought of these and gave them to my nice and nephew for their christmas gift they are a awesome tablet for the price
bought for my grandson for christmas he love it glad i went with the gb thanks to the advice of best buy employee
this is the send echo i have purchased and i love them they are a lot of fun and have great sound on top of that i would definitely remmend
great all around tablet lor and resolution is very nice best price for a nice product
pretty much this is worth it just to have alexa play anything from prime music my kid love talking to alexa once she understand them and i use the timer function all the time while oking only keep one shopping list and one to do list but it great to just say something and have it added to a list alexa is great for the capability she ha but the skill are limited so far so i remmend looking into capability or plan on programming your own for example she doe not me out of the box able to read your email even though she can access google calendar she is also not proactive such a notifying you of a phone call or email but overall fun add on if you are in the market for a speaker
love the st of the kindle great price for a tablet for child very user friendly
seemed to be fine a chtistmas gift for granddaughter however today she reported that it would not turn on or charge today supposed to have two year unnditional guarantee do not know where to take it
doe what is say and more although initially somewhat mplicated to get thing going
it is easy to set up and easy to use you can use it to watch video from the amazon prime video or listen to music with the amazon prime music or read on the kindle great value for everything you get
i wa hesitant to buy a fire tablet but i just needed an extra around the house tablet and i wa very impressed if you need a tablet just to browse the internet watch movie and light basic search it perfect
so i love my electronics i have an ipad but when i saw this on sale i got myself one just to have since i am a prime member i figured i uld use this too the only thing i like about this is that you an expand the the storage if the ipad had that option it would be amazing so since i then expanded the memory i can have more movie to watch offline camera is horrible so i would say if you have a younger child this may be decent but nothing mpares to an ipad
the greatest kindle i have ever owned would be great for kid also
great tablet for those new to tablet or just goofing around on
i purchased this tablet because it wa extremely cheap i m not impressed with anything about it it is slow not at all user friendly and the advertising is so very annoying it is also almost totally useless a it doe not support the few apps i use on a regular basis i will keep it only to access my amazon acunts
i use this speaker to play pandora station to give weather and news update wish i uld access my calendar on icloud
i got it because a frend that really lime it i had apple tv and still think is better than this
i have only had this for a short time but it is great even our year old nephew enjoys it
excellent product zipper than the fire stick attractive design
the amazon fire tablet is great for book reading and simple apps
great picture just the right size and ha the blue dimmer
great product i would remmend this device to everyone looking stream
no glare anywhere even on the beach also you can read in the dark with no problem
i love alexa i can ntrol my thermostat and all my light switch with her this product is definitely worth the money
i wish you uld keep dvr longer but otherwise good
no question about it this is the best e ink e reader available much easier on the eye for long reading session that any tablet even one with a sharp screen like an ipad air mini or top of the line samsung
i love my echo there is not much you cannot ask alexa very informative great sound when listening to music and the game are fun to play with friend i would not trade it for nothing else
i bought this for my daughter who ha down is syndrome it wa an inexpensive first time tablet for her she absolutely love it and is always watching her show and video it is easy for her to navigate and understand
excellent product work flawlessly and very handy
it is a great streaming device with all the apps you need for streaming whatever it is you watch cut the cable go to streaming it will save a lot of money
a friend told me about this product and it wa a great deal
my wife love the tablet she is only using it for internet so far and it ha worked flawlessly
for the price this is a product that i would remmend to anyone who like to read
i only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment music game and ebooks it is a great basic tablet at a low price the sd card i added allows me to save lot music and book the tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it hold up well
light weight and easy to use very user friendly durable
i had purchased one year ago for my mother this wa a replacement to the kindle the fire some different feature but keep my mother busy with mind game and sure help on that long trip to italy
got it a a gift for my dad so far so good didnnot realise the special offer are ad spend more money to buy the one with out them also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection you now need wifi to connect to the store
love my echo alexa is fun to talk to and play with
for a device with k technology they do not seem to advertise it much you can barely see it on the box also search feature only work for amazon that is a waste of a search feature remote disnnects from the box often and your have to take the battery out of the remote to reset it i would not remmend until amazon fix the bug
i have been using kindles for many year and have tried every model out there for my purpose the paperwhite is the best i have a very wide range of interest in my reading and the ease that the paperwhite offer in creating folder to make accessing book is truly remarkable it is so easy to switch from alphabetizing by author date of purchase or title of book my eye give me trouble on some day so i really like how easy it is to change font size and background lighting since purchasing the paperwhite i have delegated my fire almost exclusively to the role of playing game almost all of my reading is done on the paperwhite this purchase wa actually a send paperwhite that i use a a sendary kindle which i keep next to my bed for easy access for nighttime reading even though the paperwhite is so light having one in each of the place where i read the most is very nvenient
if you have prime it is great for the money slow performance tho
we live our new alexa the grandkids have fun asking her question and she provides u with ton of info a well
my son really enjoys his tablet especially the book and video
if you are buying it is a great price to buy for you kid they should me with a case for same price
we really love our echo we have so much fun playing around with her
you might find it somewhat short on available apps my wife ha an android samsung that is quite deep in app selection that is not to say you cannot find suitable choice every machine ha it is qwerks and the kindle start up when you plug it in to charge unnecessary overall the is great viewing especially for the older eye
if you have not bought one of these already i suggest you do so you wonbe disappointed
there are a few thing i like about the device i like the remote i like that i have access to amazon prime video and music i like that direct tv now is available however there are a few thing that need to improve on the fire tv one i have had more buffering issue on this device than i have had on my apple tv or roku box two alexa is a joke very little that she actually doe three the app store is not a vast a other service
this tablet performs surprisingly well especially nsidering it is just the hd screen produce good image great video i own two ipad mini and i must say that while this is not quite a exotic a the mini the price make it the better value hand down one key feature is that it ha a micro sd slot which allows you to instantly increase storage capacity up to gb i believe this make it very capable of managing large amount of photo video
i had the original kindle it lasted a long time jut got this paperwhite kindle it is really better strongly remmend it
i looked into many review before buyin this device bec i wa not nvince at first twas initially offered by amazon for then with prime for but missed all those deal bec it wa a newmer in the gadget arena so i waited for awhile but should have grab it when it wa launched bec alexa is just amazing and make u a bit of a master by his good capture voice mmands ask anything and it will answer the best way it can maximize with prime membership and u have a great music entertainment great buy
love the product it doe everything they say and some really ol other stuff not mentioned awesome
amazon fire hd tablet gb wi fi black i purchased this for my sister i really appreciate the geek squad for setting this product up for her and for teaching me how to use it now i can pa that i learned onto my sister

this tablet is wonderful and a great value it is performance is fast
wonderful product uld not do without it thoroughly enjoy it if you are a prime member you get to watch tv show and movie through prime free
there are cheaper kindles and nsiderably more expensive one but this model hit the sweet spot it ha sufficiently high resolution to make reading mfortable a good backlight and is mfortable in the hand
this is a great piece of hardware i love it really good all around
this is a fantastic product picture quality is awesome increased our internet speed so hardly an buffering much faster than the stick
love this product it doe just want i purchased it for
this would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level android tablet but it is impossible to play music from google play on it only amazon that is ok since is their business but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it if you have a short budget and do not care about being attached to amazon only this tablet is for you
very easy to use and doe everything i need it to do would have given it star but it ha not changed enough from the last kindle that i purchased several year ago
simply the fastest and best tablet for the money and best buy wa the easiest place to get it
really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter learning i do wish it had more storage and more item for kid but we do love the tablet

i had this kind of tablet before i like it therefore i i purchased it again i do remmend this tablet
i spent a lot of time resisting the kindle and using the app on my ipad but i took the plunge on the paperwhite for a long trip i wanted to use my ipad for tv while reading the paperwhite is crisp you can read it through day and night and downloads book with a quickness i never would have thought such a simple device ended up taking priority over everything on my list of travel gear whether i m on a red eye or sitting on my back porch in the day i can see the text mfortably and crisply really love this reader do not cheap out on the one without the backlight
did not work is good a i thought it would switch to google home much better product

this is a fantastic product for reading book it is wonderful to use in full sunshine i have a kindle fire so i thought this would be unnecessary now i am wishing i had purchased it sooner the much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire

the amazon fire hd is great choice for a beginner or not so tech savy person
thought it uld not get any better than my fire stick turn out it can be faster
smartphone work on the job for me but with the fire i can read instruction and worksheet it is a useful tool for connecting with both friend and lleagues inch is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you give me the information beat printing everything out or carrying around a large laptop
i use this device for watching movie and tv show i will suggest install mx player for mp mkv etc video it is a nice device for beginner
i have started to allow this device to grow on me yes i saw some lor variation but either my eye have adjusted or it is gone away i m back to reading like i used to and love it
work great nice upgrade over the fire stick a it ha an ethernet port heavily focused on amazon ntent duh but if you have a prime acunt this is a must
fast working tablet but very limited on apps i like it but it wa not really for me only apps available were from the amazon app store so many apps that i hoped to use were unavailable so it is good for limited use
simple hook up to smart phone and internet love this product and learning more u for it every day
great ereader the pagepress feature is so much better than swiping to turn page my only mplaint is that i had to turn the auto adjust light feature off a it doe not seem to reasonably adjust based on where i am reading
my daughter love this device she love to read and doe not like kindles because she love the feel of the book in her hand but this product offer her unlimited reading at a very inexpensive st and it travel anywhere is light and just fantastic for her
voice feature is really nvenient fast with little to no buffering but i do not like that you have to pay for episode on channel you already pay from subscribed channel like amc roku doe not do that
rd is too short
this tablet is great for beginner like myself i have not done much more than check email and read article but there is more to learn and do
this is just a basic kindle fire for my yr old child it work fine for her it obviously doe not have mparable picture quality when mpared to the hdx version but it still ha the same function it doe have a rear and forward facing camera making it easy to take picture of the dog there are lot of safety feature and apps for kid also

great gift for my nieceshe is using it every day
great tablet for all age nice hd lorlittle difficult for young child
update more than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix and it ha been overall very reliable bottom line this is the best streaming device for the dollar in my humble opinion it is cheap it handle netflix prime hbogo plex game a lot more doe not seem much slower than the full firetv box i started with a roku in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box then the firetv stick replaced the roku i tried the roku stick but returned it because it wa just too darn slow i m mpletely firetv now and happy with it what it doe it add internet streaming functionality to any tv monitor with an hdmi port you can use any of the thousand of paid and or free apps such a netflix amazon prime hulu plex news digital fireplace etc there is a ton you can do with some extra effort you can sideload thing like kodi and rd party apps it is super simple to use and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast the good stuff same pricerange a the le capable le powered chromecast roku stick more ram memory than the mpetition keep thing running smooth more storage space than the mpetition you can store more apps game etc you can do some gaming with it but the firetv box is better suited so small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease simple clean interface lot of game apps to choose from the phone app is actually pretty usefulnot a good stuff no connection other than usb for power if you need ethernet audio in out get the box read more

i read a many review a i uld find before buying this newest paperwhite and what struck me the most wa the ntrast of the bright screen versus the print however when i got mine i had to put the brightness level to out of to get it to a mfortable setting doing that make my battery run down before i have even read two book and that is with the airplane setting on meaning the wifi is off luckily i bought a charger so i can charge my paperwhite while on trip without my mputer in a regular outlet or at night when i m finished reading now for the positive i love the light weight of this kindle even with the preferred ver that shuts it into sleep mode when closed i absolutely love the dictionary feature because it is so easy to use and it save the word i do not know for study after i have learned a word is meaning i can delete it from the list i got the paperwhite with the ad because it is nice getting suggestion of book i might enjoy that i might not see otherwise and book are easy to order from the kindle store and to download through this devise i like the ver because it protects the screen from scratch while stored in my purse and i also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprint off the screen and i like that generally i am happy with this purchase
ha a great price if you do not mind all the advertising ad everywhere limited apps offered by amazon
great product for those that have service from different apps and device here one can access many in one device with ease of setup
good product for le price best deal from bestbuy
needed this for a year old to play game and watch movie and it is a great fit for the
bought it a an e reader nvenient and easy to use text is very readable i am pleased
it a good product but the o is kind of slow also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disnnect itself
i have both google home and amazon echo i also have a harmony hub and several smart home device i love the smart home integration and once you activate light and your entertainment center with your voice good luck going back for now the echo ha better integration with my smart home but once google home catch up i will be switching to google for the sole reason i subscribe to google play music but to be honest all of these device have limited u and the fun or ol appeal wear off soon it is fun to ask alexa question or ask her to tell you a joke but that get old quick it is also ol to order something from amazon but i rarely do so because i like to look at what i m ordering the sound quality is passable for a small speaker i prefer to send music to my receiver through other mean i e google home and chromecast audio at the end of the day it is a fun device to have that provides some useful skill ordering domino is ol but i have only done it once and game i like jeopardy but it is true usefulness is it ability to be the voice hub for your smart home if you re interested in having one
i hate amazon app store nothing good in there the tablet is too slow for what i do it is good for reading only

decent somewhat slow netflix freeze up at time
the only problem that i had is that it should have been included with the kindle paperwhite there is no way to charge the paperwhite unless you buy the charger the charging port on the paperwhite is so small that nothing that i already have will work kindle doe not even provide a usb cable so that you can charge from your mputer the outlet plug is cheep plastic hollow and will probably break no warranty

great for reading anytime of day size is perfect

went to buy the kindle paperwhite but after mparing them side by side i decided to buy the voyage i thought that the print wa a little sharper and i liked the smaller and lighter weight i have been using it almost every day and really really enjoy it

we love our alexa she keep all of our appointment and play great music and keep u up to date on weather and news
snagged it on sale for then got another disunt from accumulated bb point it is not hd but i do not find that necessary on a small screen i like the form factor fit into at or jacket pocket amazon app store lack the number of apps of google store but there are easy way to install google apps store while you can use it for productivity task with a mpatible keyboard i bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix show on a bigger screen than her iphone it wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak but the ability to add storage via micro sd is nice even at it is a good buy for what it is
it is a little hard to figure out how to put the program into the echo bc we are not really super savvy on doing this type of application
i love my echo that i received for christmas from my wife that i bought it for my son in law for his birthday he ha amazon prime so he can do much more with the echo i will be subscribing also
this tablet exceeded my expectation in so many way bought the first a uple month ago for my son is th birthday at this price i wouldnt be heartbroken if he broke it then i got one for my niece planning to get more see how excited i am about it well worth the price
fire tv is fast i remmend this to everyone all my worker purchased them too
this is a good a my my ipod i would remmend it
at it is worth getting if you have prime or just use amazon a lot at on sale right now it is a bargain there is only one thing about it that is somewhat of a drawback not very good battery life but keep it in an area with a strong wi fi signal and use airplane mode when you do not need wi fi and you ll only have to charge it every night seriously every night
i brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed i basically wanted a tablet for quick web search without having to boot my pc i wa nervous to try again but am so glad i did the amazon fire tablet is awesome for quick surfing task i also use the kindle e reader app on it and this work well too the reason for my star rating instead of is two fold but both are related to apps my first issue is the yahoo email app for some reason i do not have access to my contact in it i didnrealize this at first when i wa just reading email but trying to send an email wa awful it took about a half hour because i had to dig through my inbox for email from the people i wanted to send to so i uld find their address to put in the to box of the new message i wa creating what a pain the other issue is that the app world is dominated by for iphone and for android so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doe not fit neatly into one of those two category however these are minor annoyance and not the primary reason why i wanted a tablet so if you need to do quick internet search research or want to use the ereader then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive love love love my new amazon fire tablet
enjoy not having to look up everything on the internet or my phone unique have not learned all it can do yet interesting
i have enjoyed this product everyday since i purchased it i would highly remmend it
it wa the perfect christmas present made everyone smile
i absolutely love my echo there is not a day that go by it is not being used would highly remmend to anyone with a hectic schedule like myself
we all love the echo my son love getting weather music and joke and we are starting to set up the house for remote ntrol through the device very helpful device cannot wait to have more of the house connected
the echo is a device with great potential amazon doe need to improve the search feature to make it more useful
gave a a gift to niece in hospital she loved it wa able to do everything on the tablet she wanted to easy to use i wa the one who set it up for her wa very simple
it wa a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far
i have always been a fan of gadget and i had to have it i had read some of the review that were quite favorable but i had to find out for myself i absolutely love it the sound is rich and room filling in fact the sound in bigger than it very discreet size
i heard nothing but good thing about the fire tv although i had to ask around to see if someone uld hook it up because it didnme with instruction but overall i m extremely happy
i love alexa she ha gotten me in trouble from ordering from amazon but still love the echo every week it seems like she can do more if you re a amazon prime member it is a great device
have not had any issue with it and got it on sale pretty cheap
this is a very nice option to get to my favorite ntent i used audio receiver for simple connection to tv and additional audio option the push button voice interface work a well a my echo a a prime member ntent is plentiful and broad enough for my entertainment
i am really pleased with my new kindle i had one of the oldest version and wa reluctant at first on getting this one but oh boy i hit the jackpot if you have never owned a kindle you will be really pleased on how easy on your eyesight this thing is mpared to reading on a tablet battery life is amazing i turned off wifi and got over week of battery life by reading around hour a day i recharged it before it wa mpletely depleted the addition of backlight is actually ol even reading before night it did not disrupt my sleep cycle and you get all the goody of amazon backing up your digital ntent overall i am very pleased with my purchase

thanks to amazon for standing behind the product they sell mine quit working after a year and replaced it great
got the echo and wa so happy with it got the dot then moved up to the smart home bulb and now alexa turn on my light moving to thermostat next
my only problem with this tablet is if you do not have internet you lose the picture of the game you have installed and you have to guess to open them
nice budget tablet fast and doe the job for the price is a nice tablet
i purchased two of these tablet a pink and blue they wa for my and year child they really love their tablet yes it wa a birthday gift
it is amazing what this echo can do i would remmend this for anyone
it doe not get five star because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger it wonplug in all the way it stay loose and me out other than that it is just with my grandson want it he love it
so far the amazon fire is great with limited issue we are used to clicking on our dvr and watching all the taped program we missed we are still trying to figure out how to do that on the fire
i love my new kindle it is very slim and easy to use
the tablet and chrome cast is great for my child
work just a well a my rokus however the interface is mpletely awful buy the fire for kodi buy a roku for everything else
fast shipping and very happy with the amazon fire tv
we are so happy with our fire stick that we rushed back to best buy to another on for our friend
i wanted to cut the rd from satellite tv and search for a lower st alternative i love the amazon fire tv easy to set up only disappointment is i cannot watch all of the same program channel i did on satellite tv i am saving mo since i cut the rd
i would remmend this tablet to anyone very good tablet
quick easy setup fun we use it all the time checking our mmute weather joke recipe to helpful to mention it all
great product for what it is designed for easily modified for kodi
nice size and nice price for looking at my camera image on the go
first one died within hour of setting it up returned and reluctantly got a send this one ha been solid so far
i am an amazon prime member so the amazon fire tv seems to be a no brainer i took advantage of the sling tv offer where you prepay for month you get off of the streaming device so basically for more you get month of channel that is a good deal take advantage of it
i have missed my pandora since i moved from ft worth tx to lorado a few month ago my nephew had the amazon tap and i wa amazed at all the thing his kid were having fun with it saying alexa tell mimi their grandmother to go to bed and it did and the sound and quality of music ming from it awesome i had to have one so i went to local best buy and bought it i even set it up myself i m so wa impressed with myself lol but i have listened nonstop to is music or music from dirty dancing which i loved i have ordered a little case from amazon m to keep it if it tip over or just to carry from room to room which i have been doing i feel like i have a new found friend love listening to this little cylinder who is a good a bose in my book get it you ll love it i do very very pleased with it weather update here or where my kdis are just checking no interruption or mmercials when listening all day long
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet android o though
the paperwhite is certainly better than the regular kindle primarily due to the back lighting feature if you buy a kindle ereader this would be the one to buy you uld spend more for the higher end model but there is really no need the main issue with this ereader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen i tried two paperwhites and both had the same issue perhaps this is just how they are
alexa is a blast had to go with it rather than google
we bought this to stream tv so we uld cut our cable bill streaming live tv with playstaion vue and watching movie through amazon prime ha worked well we also have the le expensive fire stick and this product work much better
great product excellent packaging easy to use work my connected home well however voice ntrol get some getting used to
nice tablet great price for the product make a good gift for someone
i liked the idea of having both my kindle and tablet in one
so far have enjoyed using the device have not found a serious application for it yet but enjoy what we have tried so far
this device is awesome the best voice mmand device i ever had
not the best case amazon ha ever put out i have a number of other amazon brand kindle and kindle fire case for my various kindle device and this is the least effective of the bunch it doe not stand in any position so i cannot use my hand free it also doe not line up properly when closed so the fire seems to me out of sleep mode thus draining the battery more quickly and finally i have disvered that i do prefer the leather vers over whatever material this is made from i understand that the st of a leather case would probably be half the st of the kindle fire hd not that this case wa any bargain at
exactly what you expect from this product great for it is price
we re happy with alexa we shuttle it from place to place without a problem i just had higher expectation but we still enjoy it
alexa pick up my voice clearly great sound and very stylish for my living room
this is great if you have two kid and want to give them a tablet to play with my problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently support audible m that is the hardware support audible in order for my child to use audible i had to disable all of the family feature and try to turn it into a reader i wa sad because there are lot of great family feature that i had to disable i did not use geek squad i reached out directly to kindle support pre sale they uld not tell me the difference between the free and paid family package i had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family feature even then i uld not disable the alexa app my child ha full access to alexa and the right to turn on shopping kind of scary so my disappointment is that amazon doe not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible m on for my child is learning disability
i wa looking for a good speaker for my wife that wa easy this is a good speaker and uld not be easier once set up set up is the only reason for not giving it a initial set up is easy but getting skill and some music with separate log in wa a little nfusing
great value for a great virtual assistant a good start for initiating a smart home
good solid tablet with ability to use mcsd card at a great price only down side is amazon interface restricts full android platform
this is a good tablet for the price i dont have a lot of apps i use more for reading and watch video i think is a good deal
great for playing music finding out the weather forecast etc still learning all the option available
amazon ha made a device that is very easy to use for a first time tablet user like myself
wow i wa missing out on all the fun and nvenient application this little thing can do i thought oh like a toy and ill get tired of it wrong i now have light set to it drop in on friend ask any question i need answer to get step by step recipe just a thousand thing to many to list get yourself one it awesome
i read the review watched the youtube video did ton of research and talked myself into getting an echo i am so glad i did it ha been the most useful thing i have purchased in year turning out to be one of the most fun one too i get my news weather music and audio book with nothing more than a request to alexa i also ntrol my nest thermostat and philip hue light with a request a well i have my alarm set up through my echo a well a my shopping list to do list and about a hundred other thing it seems i love my echo i think you ll love it too
never thought this would be a useful a it is just ask alexa to play a song and it will
that is my only issue with it v the last one but it wa bought for a living room tv that doe not use it so no biggie easy to install kodi on just wish they would dede vc file smoothly maybe the next gen
bought for christmas and it ha been a hit alexa is easy to use totally satisfied
love this i didnwant anything super big or bulky something simple for a few fun app game
awesome tablet for the price but the only n is that you cannot get google play on it you have to use the amazon app store
i purchased this a a gift for a special need child he wa able to use mine with ease so i bought his his own best buy carry amazing vers a well and he is now able to listen to music learn lors and number and access movie in a fun interactive way this is an amazing purchase for the price
this is a cheap tablet i bought this so that my kid would not ruin another ipad by crushing it this tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again if it doe not have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it
great upgrade replacement no problem with it at all
great for a kid beginning cheap price and play all his game
great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking question
the device is great to have in your home like asking what the weather would be like playing your favorite sound etc
this is so perfect for reading if you only want it for reading then i would most definitely get this i can read for hour on it in light and in the dark it is super easy to buy book and download book favorite christmas purchase
gift purchase for my son and family for christmas
i am happy with my purchase of alexa it is user friendly aand easy to learn i also find it nvienient and time saveing in it ability to adapt ha some quirk but nothing major overall a joy toown and use
wa not really sure of all of the capability and application for the echo and i am still disvering them but after a week or so i am happy with the product easy initial setup easy access to my home wifi amazon acunt and google acunt i have already used it to set timer and reminder and re order past amazon purchase all easy peasy lemon squeezy
excellent product and make reading book very easy very light and allows you to have access to numerous book on the go the e paper display make reading really enjoyable and doe not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the display on phone and tablet
worth the price very light and love that it is personal
i originally got the amazon tap i had read the review that mentioned that the sound wa hollow with no bottom that wa rrect i returned it got the echo and there is a big difference the only problem is that it doe not have portable power pack i have seen rd party source and i m gonna try it i highly remmend this item it is all that it claim
the tablet work fine but speaker are not that great if you want a good cheap tablet that work this is it
purchase this tablet during the christmas holiday on sale got a a gift for my job is christmas gift party the person who got it wa very happy with it i am familiar with the tablet because i bought one for my wife when they first came out for her to use to read her book
i found the amazon fire hd to be very easy to travel back and forth to school i can easily transfer my work in class to my main mputer at home
bought them a gift for my nephew who are teenager and they love them obviously you cannot expect them to be a high quality a the tablet but for on black friday they will serve their purpose
so i wonbe able to go into super depth for this i only needed a device to run one app for my purpose it literally ha one job i can say for the price it is far more responsive that i would have ever guessed and the screen clarity is great good battery life i wa disappointed that the lock screen would always show ad i do not have the package and i do not recall it being forward with this fact in the setting i said i had to pay to disable ad because in exchange for the subsidized price they can do ad or something like that i kinda get that and for most people this may not be a big deal but for my reason this is a bit unprofessional to have so when buying it whatever the price you may have to shell out more still all said and done good price for simple need
use expanding all the time would be a if more nsistent with finding answer in a google like capacity bought this one for my si and she love it for playing specific music genre
great for streaming price is affordable i will tell my friend
the new paperwhite is a big improvement over the first generation kindle i had the text is much more crisp and easier to read and the backlit screen make reading possible in any lighting ndition
fully understand this is a budget tablet but the memory size and quality of screen are not to par
really like the touch screen factor really light up easy to read especially since you can enlarge the font
good to have for your at home entertainment it ha every app known to man
worked well a expected
my experience with alexa it is been pretty good the grandkids love to ask question a she have an answer for each and everyone
easy to use and set up it is the best tablet for reading book or listening to audiobooks
bought this for all four of my child and they loved it
great additional piece to go with echo if you want a additional unit you cannot beat this product and the price
i wa impressed how good this tablet is for the price that i paid really good tablet for the kid
the tablet is almost perfect need to add more apps
gave this to my wife it serf it is purpose great price
my girl were super excited to get their fire for christmas unfortunately one of them stopped regnizing the touch screen after an hour of opening amazon wa kind enough to send u a new one direct with a return label so returning it wa simple crossing my finger still though
this is a great alternative to an ipad especially for the price i would definitely remmend
got this for a christmas present for her and she love it help that i am a prime member a well cuz she can download more movie and so on
i love this kindle the backlight feature make it very nvenient
this is a great tablet for kid not expensive and doe all that is needed on a high level the only draw back is the amazon app store
this is my send kindle have a few more item to learn but love it easy to get around the apps
i wa excited about purchasing the amazon echo but when i received it after about week i had to return it because a lot of time alexa did not hear me or understand what i asked
perfect for carrying around with you carefree for everyday task like email facebook reading news etc you cannot beat it
nice size good tablet for the price bought three to have some spare only problem is having to get extra app to run you tube properly
cute little fire it seems to be worth the value for all the thing it can do it uld run a little faster nice for the buy
bought this for my wife and she love it she said the charge last day and she is a heavy reader the backlight is great would highly remmend this product
great tablet for a toddler to start on the parental ntrols can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways
this product is real bad from amazon although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this wa even below my expectation it way slow to respond to anything or everything my year old go after my ipad when i give him this wont remmend to anyone
fast and responsive well worth the price for the nvenience
great tablet for easy operation wa a great upgrade for a family member
my year old love it the amazon free time is great a lot of apps free for a small yearly fee
i liked my really old one a bit better it broke after year suddenly the screen failed i had to pay over buck extra to get rid of the ad to amazon i wa not aware of this when i first bought so it wa more expensive than expected
and you cannot beat the price normally these were on sale for for black friday so i picked up a gift

i have the first version and i cannot wait to see my son face when he get for christmas
great for reading in low and bright light easy to download book
this is my first electronic reading device i wa one of those people saying i like the paper book in my hand however the nvenience especially when traveling is an understatement
i belive this tab is one of the best low priced tab on the market there are a lot of free apps and the screen resolution is supurb i would remond this tab highly
nice item only drawback occasional pause upon turning page or creating bookmark
i am enjoying alexa echo i mostly use it for listening to music and podcasts i have begun using it for internet call which are fun to use for hand free calling
have only had it a week but enjoy all the thing it can do
i bought this tablet for my year old grand daughter and she love it we set the parental ntrols for her age group and now we do not have to worry about what she is doing on it we downloaded her favorite disney movie onto it and now she ha her own little private movie theater it also work great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid show this is a great buy for the money and i remmend it to everyone
it is a good e reader and the service at best buy store wa perfect
news weather and music that is pretty much all we use it for if you have amazon prime it is nice to just request certain music to play sound is ok not terrible not great
i absolutely love the echo i use it a part of my smart home set up and alexa keep me up to date with my appointment weather and even traffic when i am about to leave for work glad i made this purchase
my wife ha had one for quite a bit and she wa always telling me this wa the way to go no matter how low i put the brightness on my phone it wa still a very harsh light i can easily set the brightness to a mfortable level still use it in any light and i find i fall asleep faster at night side it is easy in the eye
read online and price mpared to get a great deal
this is a great e reader perhaps a little pricey but well worth the money it is extremely light and the e ink is very readable
i love how you can keep up with social medium and watch movie online this is fantastic
slow connecting basic model still a good product just not very advanced
we found this to be an excellent music source signed up for the month unlimited amazon music subscription it is great to be able to request any kind of music at any time speaker quality is excellent a well it wa very easy to setup love that you can add item directly to a shopping list or a to do list i would have given this star if the search feature wa more robust
i have really wnjoyed this tablet ha not given me any reason to dislike it
can not beat the quality of the product for the st
this item is great doe not take any space plus ha some great feature
my daughter love it this device provided all the service she wanted

saw advertisement for it so i thought i buy super easy to use
amazon tablet are the best android tablet available
very affordable and it work i bought this for my kid and they like it
had the hd fire and wa disappointed that it did not have an sd slot this one ha the slot and ha worked flawlessly my kid love it i bought of them
happy with product especially at this price easy to use and small to carry with me
what else can i say this is an awesome little device and is leading me towards cutting out cable altogether
keep my granddaughter busy she wa showing me how to use it now she doe not want to use mine
this wa my first kindle i did do some research and read many review on this one i have been very satisfied with this purchase and would remmend the paperwhite to anyone looking for a reader
while i have not even begun to use all of the function of the echo it ha already shown that it is worth the price paid it is entertaining nvenient and just plain functional the quality of the sound is fantastic and yes like other reviewer have said it would be nice if it uld be used in njunction with a subwoofer even so we are satisfied
the amazon fire tv box hook to cable modem easily and is very user friendly great for amazon prime member the only issue is that there is not enough k ntent out there and in my opinion doe not warrant the price a opposed to the more portable amazon fire tv stick yes the box ha a faster processor and more ram than the stick but for ntent i have had no problem with the stick and it is cheaper
bought this for my year old father in law it wa easy to setup to his wifi and very easy to use he love it and now ha a facebook page
same a other tablet just ha blue back witch i have not seen before in lors work really good
my wife take with her everywhere and always read her book now with this
i use this to access my amazon prime movie and netflix i like it
both my boy age and absolutely love their tablet i uld not be happier with them and very satisfied with the price
bought this to replace a nexus player and happily surprised how much smoother this box is and mcast allows more apps to be installed on amazon firetv device than androidtv device for some reason so definitely a plus
it is nice to be able to tell alexa what you need from wherever in the house and the echo take care of it sport uodates news music etc all with your voice very nvenient
it is a good tablet for the kid to play their game on only drawback is the way the rd plug into the kindle we have had to fix kindles because of this issue for the price though it is worth it
fun to use with the kid and work with a lot of product
my son love it he is only understands how to use it and i can see it ha helped him learn word animal and etc it is a very good way to keep the brain moving and active
good tablet wife love it and would remmend
she love it play with it everyday all day thanks
not a smart a the mmercials show cant answer a lot of question
this is a great tablet for under and you can add kodi on it to me thats the best feature and the duel sided camera
i use it everyday after work for down time
the apps for the kid are slow and do not all show up on their home page but other than that it is great for the price and to entertain my child

i have had every kindle e reader available though it doe not have all the feature available on the voyage the paperwhite is the best the issue i have had are the emergence of tiny light leak emerging from the source through the matte textured page background they re little pinhole sized bright light scattered across the page it usually begin with just one or two and bemes several over time it is distracting to reading in a nventional book it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page if these little thing do not bother you then it is not an issue the paperwhite model do not seem to have this problem a often a the voyage doe i went through voyage model before surrendering and returning to the paperwhite the paperwhite ha fewer total light so it is not a evenly lit a the voyage however it is nothing significant
kindle paper white is a fantastic e reader it ha great ntrast is easy on the eye and the backlight is just right for reading in darker environment
a well worth it purchase no mplaints uld not be happier
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablet out there if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pa this up
this tablet u the amazon version of the android operating system not all apps and function are available for use on this device tablet is reasonably fast and responsive screen is sharp and bright with a wide viewing angle speaker is minimal and lack fidelity external bluetooth speaker not included or hard wired audio system not included work well bluetooth work well wifi n work well both camera are weak and grainy check to make sure the apps you want to use are available and also check to make sure they work well

i actually purchased these tablet for some student that attend an after school program at the salvation army but i also have a kindle fire a my personal tablet
kindle make reading easy lightweight and the light make reading much easier in low or no light
i cannot say enough about this so i will just say i love it very loud louder than my bose soundlink mini speaker and better sound quality however because it is so loud it doe not catch what you re trying to say if the volume is too loud also i m mexican so i have a hard time getting it to understand what music to play when it me to music with spanish title other than those two thing though i have no mplaints it is very easy to use and wa very easy to set up
able to read more and longer than i thought light is bright enough but too bright to bother someone nearby
i have the fire stick and the fire tv box i got the box because it allows you to pair a bluetooth headset so you can listen to your show at night without waking anyone up problem is there is interference between wifi and bluetooth and so listening with headphone get very choppy have to connect box thru ethernet to fix problem
i got this for reading book i still like ipad better though
great tablet and very user friendly great to read off of and surf the web
the screen is a good size and i really like the touch screen this is a great tablet
i purchased three of these for family member a christmas gift on black friday for only each pro price is great responds well to touch and running application small portable again the price is the best pro to this tablet n main homepage run ad in the background why apps are only available through the amazon app store making a very limited selection mpared to google play and the app store for apple but again this equal to the tax i paid on my ipad air
work a annticapated would remmend might buy another one this survey is not working right
bought this for my wife for mother day to replace another tablet that wa tough to use a a reader outdoors battery last a long time which is good on long road trip
i didnknow much about the dot echo but when a friend showed it to me it seemed like a great gift for my husband who is hard to buy for it is something you uld live without but once you have it you re so glad you do

my grandson is totally in love with his new fire tablet he had an older version and wa grateful for the upgrade
i purchased this tablet to read book online and i love it the screen is nice
for this price everybody should have one of this tablet it work really good
i wa so looking forward to this that i bought it right when it popped up a available on best buy this is obviously the most refined kindle on the market a of now the ergonomics are just perfect a there is no other kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is a easy to use single handed a this one fit perfectly in the palm and the page turn button are a joy to use the charging case can be removed while reading and it snap back easily you do not have to deliberately align it properly once the case is connected it start charging the kindle which prolongs it battery life in short if you are an avid reader and can spare this is the kindle to buy for occasional reader it might not make sense to spend so much and the kindle paperwhite should do just fine
echo work well with a variety of different device that have different protols it is an easy start to home automation
love this tablet it is better than my ipad there are unlimited full length game book etc i wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep so i can play it great battery life too i highly remmend this tablet for adult and child

wa holding out til the price drop got it for on friday after thanksgiving love the tablet great for my little girl
i love every thing about the product and transaction no mplaints at all i love that it affordable and doe about every thing you would have need of
this is an excellent value this is easy to read easy to use and performs like a champ if you want an all around great reader but do not want to pay a high price this is the one
i wa not satisfied with chromecast because of it limited ability fire tv with sideloaded apps can do so much more love it
this tablet is perfect for just about anything you uld want to do on a tablet
i wa excited about the amazon echo however after getting it home setting it up and finding out how limiting it is that excitement went away fast the echo uld not answer the majority of question or would be asked a question and instead of answering it would play untry music which i never asked for unless you have smart home feature like a smart thermostat or smart light etc it is useless aside from being a speaker which for the money it is not a good speaker i did however try it for a week finding it not worth it or that googling question wa easier to answer even asking it about what movie were near me etc wa a pain some said maybe i got a defective unit which wa not the case the echo is just limited in what it can do i would say save your money this is not worth it yet
it sits there all day at the ready you can just ask it a question like math or unit nversion you can ask about the weather ask it to play music turn the volume up or down skip or restart
love the fire box save u ton on tv love all the apps
grand daughter is two year old and watch her older brother and sister use their ipads so we got her the amazon fire kid addition and she love it she ha a great time with learning number and the alphabet

great product easy to use and able to get many show and movie
thought this came without special offer the staff told me it didnamazon had a sale on this when i bought it and i thought i wa just getting the same deal but i had to pay later to get rid of the ad
very great tablet for a cheap price i love it i will remmend it to others
but the skill uld use a bit of a refresh cannot remember all the mmands a skill require certain keywords the whole point of amazon echo is to be able to say anything still fun and great if you have a lot of home automation gadget
i bought this for my girlfriendand she love it the only thing she doe not like is that some game on the app market that is on her phone doe not appear on her tablet
he figured it out in no time be sure to mbine all non child approved apps into a folder my only mplaint is the year free amazon freetime doe not work without an internet connection not everyone ha home wifi anyway that is my only mplaint
wanted to keep up to date on latest technology
it is a nice tablet for the price they are got the tablet for my kid and they like it the only thing i do not like is the battery go out pretty fast
the price on this holy w it is a great little device for the price it is a nice upgrade for my child whose older fire wa getting a little dated
i bought this for my wife a a gift and she and the rest of the family love it
the voyage is my first ereader and i am not disappointed it is light clear and a joy to use

so read review on a few tablet but honeatly felt this wa the one for my kid bought it and sure enough it wa it best apps for kid especially reading for kid amazon did a good deal on this and if you have prime it link up with your acunt for video too
this item is light downloads me in fast built great and ha a lot of bell and whistle too great for beginner and kid
good product and will definitely share to all my friend
the product worked just a it wa advertised meeting all my expectation
we gave thi to our son who is in the military and he u it all the time

after using a series of low end tablet a an e reader i purchased this on sale for it only really doe one thing display kindle book in normal lighting but it doe it well size feel and battery life are all good and unlike lcd based tablet it is easy to read outside the amazon lock screen ad are not that intrusive and easy to ignore
this is a great streaming box it is is more than i expected
well design and perfect size to carry along what it doe is to give you a quick access to e book and provide a better experience mpared to view of phone
just bought my kindle fire and although the amazon and fire me up otherwise the product is dead i have tried the help section but no help taking it back to the store if it would work i would love it
it a great little mputer quick browsing great camera
overall i wa a little skeptical because this wa not the product i wanted turn out it is amazing
the amazon fire tv ha been a great addition it is extremely nvenient to have netflix youtube and hulu all easily accessible in the same place
how can you go wrong for a tablet that you can use a an e reader to check social medium to play game on small enough to fit in your purse surf the web and it is pretty fast i highly remmend this for anyone who is looking for an affordable tablet to use for basic thing or for child who are rough on their toy i plan to buy one of these for my mother who ha an older ipad that is awfully slow
my daughter is and doe not pay much attention to it because she d rather have my phone however a a parent i d rather have her play with the tablet because it ha many free learning game apps
it is very handy great when i do not want to use a mputer and i cannotake it anywhere
this review is more of a guide for cablecutters which we have found fire tv a great way to acmplish this there is plenty of review explaining how to use the fire so this is more for people like u who do not want to pay full cable price but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable show at a significant saving to cable and are used to using a dvr we used tivo and do not want to watch mmercials we have had this box for a uple week now and while it ha taken some getting used to since you have to access your show through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list we have found it worthwhile to make the switch keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi rd into your tv we actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tv are so cheap nowadays that it wa still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill the saving in just the first several of month vered the st of the tv the interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized we got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable faster wired connection to our internet at first i wa sad to read on other review that the voice ntrol doe not work on any of the apps but honestly i have never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything there is not much need of typing to find your show on other apps so i really do not miss it at all if you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here the rest is about what apps we use and pay for to watch our show i will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we uld do without read more
needed something smaller than a laptop to carry around this is perfect

the echo is amazing in how seemlessly fit into any household doing those little thing that you wondered how you went without before purchasing everything from easy list making to playing song for the dog when not at home

bought this tablet for my five year old son he play it every single day love it great kid friendly tablet
my new kindle dx graphite came yesterday and immediately i realized i needed a ver i wa nervous when putting the dx down and picking it up fearing that i would drop or scratch it and there is no great way to carry the kindle around without a ver also i found the bare kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and i wa hoping a ver would give me a better grip this ver wa just released and i like the fact that it ha the elastic band to hold it closed like the original kindle a i had read that the older dx ver did not always stay closed i got the ver with day local delivery and it just arrived the ver weighs a bit more than ounce so the kindle with ver is ounce this make it significantly heavier than just the kindle alone oz however the ver give you several better way to hold the kindle including open like a book or folded back if you rest the kindle on something to take the weight off it is definitely more mfortable to read with it my preference is to lie on the uch with the kindle balanced on my chest stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the ver open at about degree i d give it star if it wa lighter but so far i really like it
not a good a i though but at least it doe what it is suppoused very bad screen quality
purchased a a gift for my year old niece she absolutely love it and it is easy for her to use mom love the parental setting on it a well
i love this tablet love my ipad too but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse i went for a g but there were none in stock so i got the and a memory card that i will probably never need
great product for night reading light and friendly
alexa is helpful with the weather sport update and music dancing during a party thank you alexa you even gave u some historical fact and dinner recipe idea
much faster and stable than the fire tv stick definitely worth the upgrade
the kid really enjoy this tablet this tablet is built well
great item to have but a little more than the fire stick
tablet wa for my yr old it work great it ha good parental ntrols it uld use a little more memory but well worth the money paid ship to store worked perfectly

i vacation often and enjoy reading on the kindle verse my tablet
my year old love the tablet it is very durable
this reader is a gift to my daughter for christmas she said that it work great at the beach
ordered a white echo made a great house warming gift
i wa skeptical about the u for the amazon echo and of alexa but after using it for several week i enjoy the ease of interaction and the accuracy of alexa the sound quality from the speaker is very good and i often use the echo a my go to audio device when i m needing some background music for reading oking cleaning etc
i wa not sure i would like it because i didnknow all that it uld do i am very pleased with my amazon echo and i am very happy i brought it
always a big fan of kindle this is my third one to purchase why so many you may ask i never get to use them because every one else in the family grab them great for surfing amd reading book
i bought already and so far my usins love it still working great easy to use great size for kid
perfect gift for friend or family member very easy to use
product is great doe a good job at interpreting voice mmands every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection
this worked real well very satified i wa able to download other apps too
alexa is always available to answer question or play my favorite music
i like the reduced size the touchscreen and the built in light of kindle peperwhite but i used to have a kindle nd edition device which supported background music and audible ntent
the functionality of the speaker is great sound is good
i like best by beuse they are aforedabul and cuvenet and easy to get to
love my echo i use for many thing bought a battery for it so she go everywhere
for the money this tablet cannot be beat great for kid or adult who are not looking for a powerful tablet
enjoy the fun fact each morning also use it in the morning to find out the result of the late night baseball sres
purchase a ver to go with it and it feel just like you re reading a book
i wouls remmend this over your phone or pc display anyday of the week great for your eye doesnt weight anything finished reading the gunslinger on this
i know there is a separate product page for the origami ver but it is worth mentioning here a it is the official ver the origami ver is ugly and i wa skeptical but i actually love it it is weird because it open by flipping over the top like a notepad this actually make it more mfortable to hold when the ver is open in my opinion it is hard to describe but there are a lot more way to hold the voyage when it is attached to this ver and just generally is more mfortable to use the origami part of the case work great a well it stand vertically or horizontally if you re laying down and reading this is amazing
well worth the upgrade from the amazon fire stick it is definately a lot faster and smoother
wanted for email streaming video audio great price

we have enjoyed alexa tremendously we have the echo set up to turn our light on and off we use it a a timer and play pandora through it daily
bought this tablet for a family member who is not very tech savvy wa not terribly pleased to see how overflowing the o is with amazon ad and service but i suppose that is how they keep the sts so low on an extremely affordable tablet look up how to download the google play store on this tablet to get even more usage out of it with that addition it work great and they love it
amazon tablet is great to have now i wish i bought more gb

the tablet work just great and the price cannot be beat
i like the size and battery life it would be nice to have instant definition for foreign language book i really like the vocabulary review
i purchased this item thinking it would show a higher quality in picture than the firestick but it doe not in my opinion only difference it ha more storage
i bought this tablet for my year old nephew and he love it it is easy to setup and very user friendly picked up a case for protection buy far the best bang for your buck for an entry level tablet
it started cutting off and on by itself it like it had a mind of it own

work like a charm
last got fire for my kid with an amazon freetime subscription these are very good for the price with two flaw the screen is good and much better than other android device at but not great and got the mb version with i would not remmend in hindsight because android is sub par management on sd card got these this year it ha a much better screen not only larger but with better resolution adequate speaker for it price it is fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use gb is the minimum i d remmend even with sd card because some apps just work better with internal storage and some apps even stored in sd will still use some amount of internal storage it also ha alexa voice support the main reason for these tablet in my case is the freetime subscription that ha unlimited access to thousand of age appropriate book hundred or thousand of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets amazon fire o ha a decent support for multi user and in particular kid acunts my kid are and they spend a lot of time on game a expected but also read a good amount of book
love the amazon fire k quality the remote and the ability to use it while traveling put this over the top plus it is le expensive than the roku and apple tv

awesome tablet great price everything i wa hoping it would be
love these unit have alexa on multiple floor now and just added dot a well cannot mplain sometimes doe not understand what i am saying but very good a majority of the time
this wa the hit of christmas worth every penny so much fun so many capability too many to list
the kindle fire is a wonderful addition to my laptop there are time i just do not feel like using the big laptop and the kindle is nice to have next to my bed for when i am awake at all hour love the ease of use and all the thing it can do and i do not know the half of it great item
this is exactly like any other usb power charger making it unnecessary a basic charger used for an ipod work to charge the kindle fire within hour
i researched and researched and researched streaming box from so many mpanies including roku apple tv chromecast and other off brand by far the amazon tv wa the best option for flexibility and reliability i currently have three box now for each of my tv and run playstation vue i have cut my cable bill by almost per month plus i now have the flexibility of other movie apps amazon ntent and much more the switch to streaming tv took le than minute what a great investment with a very quick return

alexa from amazon offer amazing functionality including having access to amazon is music library it can ntrol your hue lighting ha the ability to provide news and weather forecast and it even set timer when you are oking the product is a must have
awesome battery doe every thing i need it to i love it

i find the echo to be an amazing speaker enabled by saying alexa to access all kind of information and receive answer to many many question it is nstantly being upgraded with new capability and ability

this tablet is great for kid and is easy to set up and operate great price bought durning black friday weekend but best buy still had them available for the whole weekend
i will start off with the fact that i like paper book a lot i bought the e reader because it is light and cannotravel with multiple book the interface is fairly easy to use and it hold a lot of book the automatic light feature doe not work a nicely a i would overall i am happy with the purchase but there are feature that uld make it a
i just do know how i can live without my new firestick it is so easy to use and so much to see because of this
got this tablet for my year old work great even use it myself sometimes good for movie a well the only thing i do not like is too many add on it cannot take off unless you pay amazon for it
doe the job especially at that price after using lored tablet it doe take some time to get used to though
if your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use
i had used roku nvidia shield apple tv and smart tv is digital feed this device doe the heavy lifting effortlessly at price point and allows the versitility of android tv customization the apple and android smart phone remote app trump all the others winner winner chicken dinner
fantastic gadget for reading excellent quality and the right price
if you want a tablet to watch movie and use with prime this is awesome for the money not great to browse with but will get the job done cannot beat for
the echo simply performs a advertised the function that prompted the purchase wa integration with the harmony remote i use for my home theater system once installed i disvered some of the other thing the echo can do a an example it ha the ability to ntrol my phillips hue lighting system mponents that help set the mood in the theater it is not perfect but the list of capability ntinues to grow you will like it
i do not remmended if you are using apple product
much better than my original kindle lighter and easier to read the old kindle served me well and i wonretire it but it is newer version is good
work great and hold a charge forever look a if i m actually reading from paper
downloaded movie for my son to watch and the audio is terrible you uld barely hear it so i returned it
bought this on a flash sale this is great especially when running the playstation vue app streaming
i m use to android so this wa hard for me but i returned it and got something andriod
i bought this a an upgrade to the kindle fire that i bought my wife year ago she say that it is easier to read and love the smaller size
my son ha the hd fire used for last year i bought this one for my mom birthday she love it it is easy to navigate and the ability to increase the size of the print allows for the smaller screen cheaper price
i purchased three for my child and so far it is been a little over a month and they are still fully intact and bright and working the speaker are loud quality of the housing is very durable and the screen isnt scratch resistant but a screen protector can handle that charging is quick and the port is still very durable the volume and home button is easy to handle and the response of the screen is still very well the lors of the screen with game and movie is awesome child love it and my husband and i do a well we catch ourselves playing a well lol

a a book snob purist i put off buying a kindle for age after doing a lot of travelling and lugging around paperback i decided it wa time to grow up and get over it while it may not have the satisfaction of turning a physical page it make up for it by weighing practically nothing only having to have one hand free and being able to read it outdoors battery life is amazing will last over a month with moderate use have been trying to nvince all the other book lover in my family to get one

this is the third fire we have purchased and amazon finally made this level memory upgradable that ha made all the difference i bought fire tablet for use a a kid tablet for which they work great until you run out of memory gb is practically nothing these day i remember when having kb wa a huge upgrade to my atari so being able to toss in a memory card give my kid much more utility

we now own kindle fire they keep getting better very pleased
the kindle line is great for easily syncing into existing amazon acunts it is a great tablet for basic function like internet use video streaming music streaming apps etc etc etc however the tablet cannot currently stream downloaded movie from ultraviolet which is a pain for most user that primarily bought this device for that purpose i would currently not remmend the purchase of this device until you find out that amazon ha fixed the issue if one of your criterion is for the perfect tablet is to be able to watch downloaded movie
easy to set up and lot of fun to use give good info

i purchased the echo after finding it interesting from a friend purchase i am enjoying all the thing that my echo doe and still learning a there seems to be an unlimited amount of knowledge and endless option of thing to do with my alexa
you can go cheap and get the fire stick but for more this is worth it ignore the bad review a in october when it wa released it had several software bug which are now fixed i did my homework on medium device and the newest roku apple tv is doe not mpare to this fire tv box the only thing you ll get semi better luck with is the nvidia shield but you ll also pay almost more for it versus this fire tv box

bestbuy came through before the holiday better than amazon item available arrived within day mpetitively priced great service there my problem is with disappointing performance by echo siri win over alexa issue enuntered a skill will be installed but alexa will tell me first i need to install the skill and send that the skill is already installed user is stuck in a do loop with no response access to quick sentence read from wikipedia is appreciated but if you ask tell me more alexa is voice is so rushed and mputerized some of the information is unintelligible ton of skill but so many of them are at a micro level and others are time gimmick if you are not careful you then need a skill to help you with all the skill you have installed response on some of the more interesting skill are just plain wrong vocabulary on word master is limited so you will told your response is not a word that begin with x and we have had instance where our rrect response on jeopardy is reported a not rrect in one skill about a magic door a clue is described but when selected you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again frustrating and make you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly child can get frustrated quickly access to music is quirky some piece by classical mposers will play only a few minute of a selection abruptly stop and begin a new piece but some singer and ambient piece will play for hour positive flash briefing weather word definition pandora access timer
i first bought the echo dot and loved it but the sound is lacking i bought this for the living room and it sound x better it is not going to blow the window out or anything but for what i use it for it is perfect alexa you re awesome
great tablet for a great price timely free shipping
i have to nfess i am sure this thing is being underutilized it is great for weather flash briefing and other piece of information ifttt raspberry pi people tell me thing they can do and i m like hey i m getting philip hue to work that is about a advanced a i m going right now nevertheless i do enjoy being able to call up my music from amazon prime music order pizza and switch between my acunt and my wife is seriously enjoying it

love my new kindle the backlight is a huge improvement over the previous kindle but it is not an automatic backlit and must be adjusted by the user depending on the situation if you re looking for an auto backlight go for the kindle voyage

love the paperwhite option of backlighting is great when reading in the dark but still able to see when outside in the sun i do wish it had adaptive backlighting i prefer to have backpighting off to save battery during daylight reading overall a great reading device
i purchased these a door prize and they are always loved to those who win
if you are a amazon prime or playstation vue member this is a must buy easy to use connect simple log in intuitive guide small but not too small great remote relatively inexpensive k qualityonly wish i uld transfer remote feature to my logitech remote
purchased this for my wife and ended up using it myself now i have to buy is send unit integrating with other smart device get easier a your do them good buy regardless but a steal when on sale
i bought this tablet just to keep on the side i m an apple user but for buck you cannot beat that
this is an excellent streaming device it ha all kind of apps and other apps that you can download and you can even hack it to put kodi on it what i really like about the fire tv box over the fire stick is that this box ha an ethernet port so you can connect it to the internet through a hard line for a more stable connection than wifi which mean just about no buffering load time depending on the speed of internet you have with wifi you will have some more buffering load time because the signal can fluctuate and go in and out sometimes with the ethernet connection the signal stay pretty nsistent definitely remmend this
i bought this and like it very much also love doing business with best buy i will buy from best buy from now on
purchased this for my daughter to do more reading it ha so much more option for her if she want
very satisfied with the size and performance and a great deal
it cheap but the you will notice the low screen resolution mpared to ipad app is somewhat limited unless you side load it
this is really ol is of u work flawlessly
the amazon echo is wonderful it ha great tone it can do so many thing it can be a timer a sleep timer play music game give information and is mpatible with smart device for the house such a light etc this is the third echo product we have we have echo dot that we also like i highly remmend this product and also for smaller space the echo dot
i bought one of these for my father he love it and i noticed it is very well built like if it wa built the same way a the amazon fire box which i am very impressed by how well built it is even the battery terminal are polished chrome tab i mean me on what mpany go to that much trouble the charger reminded be of an i phone charger impressed by this little tablet i will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future good product for the buck
new model paperwhite purchased on first day of release it is a advertised lightweight easy to read in bright light adjustable brightness text size and style and connects to my kindle library with available wifi but that is all no access to any program or game except to buy another book
great and super for reading and graphic are clear a ncise
i am very happy with my recent purchase of the echo it is like having a genius in a tube
bought this because of the camera and good price
the echo is very neat fun to use just ask alexa question she will give you the answer
i looked at the review and they varied greatly i didnwant an electric sharpener so my choice were very limited this pencil sharpener is adequate and suit my need because i do not use pencil very often but it is very slow and sound like it is straining
this wa a christmas present for my mom she like to read it a good tablet for a ridiculous price
i love that it is lightweight and easy to use my local librarian showed me how to borrow e book and it is so simple to do perfect for me
work great i bought this for my year old after she broke her other kindle it work just a good a her kindle fire hd but it wa way cheaper there is not a lot of storage but for i wonmplain
there are so many thing the amazon echo can do some of our favorite are of urse music but also we use it every day to set timer when oking and ask the weather
put out a full amp power allowing a faster charge or power supply
pretty happy with this so far like the fact that you can add memory
best and most affordable option of all the kindle device available
better price point than apple tv but in mparison for what i am interested in prefer apple tv
fun to use and play with answer question very quickly
it is a good device for your kindle book and magazine very slow if you want to stream video though do not think it wa made for that for it price is a great buy
i had the dot but it wasnâloud enough iâ have used my sisterâ is and fell in love with this one she ha the black one so i got the white one i love it it blend in and work great
perfect for my now year old alittle off setting up since use to an ipad but she is doing great with it
i wa needing an additional streaming device for spotify this handle exactly what i need
first got it for my wife who love tech toy we played with it and laughed and laughed but after awhile it is used le and le a it cannot find answer to thing
easy way to listen news weather and traffic in the morning my husband listen pandora
got this product for my granddaughter im grandma now
i purchased this product based on the review of no glare and it ease of use both are true
easy to setup bought amazon echo for the living room and amazon dot for the bedroom fantastic ai
so i have seen this at the mall and the tv ad and thought hmmm that sound good note mine doe not sound a good a the unit i have heard play music at the store i do not know why and there doe not seem to be any adjustment you can make to that all you can do is say volume up volume down or say volume lever at no time wa i told that you needed to use your smart phone and or table to down load the alexa app and then run everything through that most of the time i say alexa who is morris knight i do not know alexa wa morris knight a vj on mtv i do not know alexa can you tell me who wa a vj on mtv i do not know so i get i do not know more often then an get and answer if i do get an answer alexa will often give me an answer to a for a different person the person i asked about if you have a amazon fire stick do not ask alexa about a movie or is joan llins in the movie the virgin queen because for me anytime i use the word movie she will turn on my fire stick so if you are watching something else you are no longer watching it she cannoturn on the amazon fire stick but she cannot put your tv back to what you were watching before the echo device will often tell you to go to the alexa app so i m really not sure what the echo device doe everything is run through the alexa app so just get your table out and use alexa that way i m just not very happy with this purchase i went to the mall and the person said bring in your tablet and i can see what is going on so see it is driven by that tablet and the app right
this is an excellent tablet for reading and playing game
product work great loaded kodi to watch movie and have not had any trouble definitely remmend this for anyone who ha decided to get rid of the cable satellite
my adaptor doe not work maybe i m doing something wrong but there are no instruction it look pretty simple so it just simply doe not work
great device only issue is if your not using it for music then the dot is a better buy
i have an amazon echo and the amazon tap work wonderfully with echo the sound quality is great it is easy to use and set up it beat turning on the receiver for music if you are looking for great and easy sound machine the tap is it
it is a nice tablet for the price the camera is not that great but it is decent beware of the memory capacity though it say that it hold gb but only ha gb of free space so le than half
where to begin let is see easy wifi or ethernet setup run all my apps run k super small footprint the remote is nice plus voice activation if you re into that super easy navigation once you setup all your apps
great little tablet for the money used some reward certificate to pay for most of it if i wa to do it again i would buy the gb version very happy with the handy little tablet
great little tablet doe everything i wanted it to do it is a breeze to get online and check email
i have used this everynight since i bought it to catch all my favorite show and movie i am so glad i bought this product
i want one that the battery life wa better than my old one i had this is just what i wanted and the price wa even better
great purchase easy to use no longer need to use my iphone for reading
purchased tablet for year old twin grandchild also purchased the protective ver absolutely love it
quick and light good for car ride plenty of apps and easy for my year old to use
this tablet is easy to use but if you need to use play store so i do not remmended because it doe not have
i chose the paperwhite primarily because of the backlighting i also own an original kindle that doe not have this feature i love the new paperwhite i recently used it on a long trip and truly enjoyed the nvenience and ease of use i loved the fact that i did not have to turn on another light to read
i am so delighted i purchased this tablet for my toddler son pro the rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating which wa crucial for this purchase another huge pro is that adult can use the tablet under their own sign on which work like any other tablet from the adult sign on you can customize what your kid can watch screen time allowance and add or remove apps for them the price is not bad mpared to the price of adult tabletsns kind of bummed i cannot link my google play apps i purchased but i guess it make sense this is not a google android product the battery life is not all that great but the charger is fast i wish there wa a freeze option that would prevent kid from hitting the screen while watching netflix or other video highly remmend for anyone with young child you wonbe disappointed
love the amazon echo easy setup and receives voice mmands well music is crisp and verbal information is very understandable
i bought this a a mother is day gift for my mother she ha not had much experience with tablet this wa a perfect choice for her doe not do anything crazy but work great for free to play game and kindle book and apps
wish we uld get some free stuff with it might have to get amazon prime to get more stuff
i bought this tablet for my mom and she love it i used it myself and it is very easy to use and work nicely with amazon prime etc definitely would remmend especially for the price
good that it ha parental ntrol good for a simple tablet
great phone for my son that are and my year old life his kindle
we ordered of these one for our llege daughter and the other our high schooler they both absolutely love them i have to admit we steal it every once and awhile love it
i bought this on impulse because i had heard great thing about it i have a variety of automated home device such a philip hue bulb and wanted to see if the echo would help me ntrol everything i now use the echo all the time for light alarm and daily news the best part of the echo is it ability to regnize multiple voice at different volume my parent also use it and have been nsidering getting one for their home the best app to use with alexa is ifttt you can have ifttt add thing to google list and calendar trigger find your phone create custom light setting for smart bulb and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency these feature are all great for me since i live by myself i definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen echo skill also expand the use of alexa by adding trivia game recipe apps and searching for hotel flight and movie one of my favorite is milo which allows you to search for movie or tv and find where it is offered on multiple service like netflix hulu etc the only downside i have found is you have to be very specific with some mmands such a which music service you want to access or triggering ifttt but amazon ha recently updated the alexa setting with the ability to change spotify to your default music player so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed if you have connected home device or live by yourself i would definitely remmend the echo i have had no issue with it and it help me everyday
we absolutely love the amazon echo aka alexa she is very helpful with information from the weather to new to sport and listening to our favorite music and plenty more it is voice activated very easy to use so anyone uld do it
little gem doe so much for such an amazing price
i have had the fire stick version of the fire tv for quite a while but finally went for the more powerful unit this little guy is great doe a fine job of bringing in the amazon offering a well a playing some casual game we tried some trivia and other simple game the voice ntrol is excellent overall i am very pleased with this unit if i had to me up with something they uld improve it would be the feel of the remote it ha a bit of a fragile flimsy feel to it
reader are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature it ha basic tool like camera not very good calculator calendar and the amazon appstore i didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps i use the most on my cellphone it is good for the price anyways
great tablet pro good size especially for travelling android based so rd party apps can be installedns amazon ad will appear instead of a wallpaper on the lock screen apparently you can pay to get rid of them which is just ridiculous can be slow when playing certain gamesnot a lot of storage space
i bought this tab a a birthday gift for my yr old nephew who life in india it is very useful for him to google for important information over the internet for his school assignment also he can video chat with me using skype rightly priced to be a kid is product resolution uld have been better if it targeted a a kid is product i think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eye while reading document with fine text
i purchase a tablet at best buy and the price wa and it wa it i love my tablet thank you so best buy
i loooooove alexa tower it is so nvenient so easy to use this item is ntinuously improving updating all without any innvenience to me with my very busy and demanding schedule i need all the help i can get
i cannot say enough great thing about the fire hd at it is low st you can still do almost everything a ipad can do if you want a great tablet at a low st look no further than amazon kindle fire is
it is small i cannotake it with me where ever i go i can read play game and get on the internet not to mention the price wa right
set up wa easy downloading of apps easy for both of u ha so many u
good basic tablet for home and the kid the only downside is that a credit debit card is required to link to the amazon store even if you download a free app i m able to let the kid use apps and the internet i can limit the site the kid can visit and apps they can use
work great hooked it up to our smart light very nvenient and useful
my kid love their kindles and love free time in it numerous educational game
i only purchased this because i loved the sound quality alexa is just a added bonus personally a i rarely hit the tap button to ask her anything the few time i asked her question she ha not disappointed extra now what would make this device amazing is if alexa wa able to connect to my apple music playlist if only
very good product and service will refer a friend
easy to buy on line and store fast shipping and pack out good
we had purchased these same tablet for our kid for christmas and we really liked them i like that they have kindle unlimited i do not nstantly have to buy book like with my nook a month for unlimited and i can read all the book i want
best option out there for a plug and play device the system is easy to use set up and is fast i highly remmend the firetv over the fire tick due to the power much clearer feed and faster response i previously had a roku which i gave away after getting this device
great buy good value value for the money easy to use
we do not do a much with the echo a we uld and should but so far it is been fun and work well there are some thing it cannot do of urse alexa cannot provide stock market information for example
our year old daughter received this for christmas and she seems to love it so fay doe just enough to keep her entertained and i love the fact that she can easily access her book when she want
perfect for that age group that i bought it for she and love it
it is everything it promised i use it to download book
i love this tablet the battery life last a long time i use my amazon kindle fire predominately for watching movie on amazon prime netflix is and checking my email i also carry it to my appointment and meeting it is a mpact tablet and not big and bulky the playback of the movie are great and the movie are hd great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movie and checking email i would definitely remmend this tablet to friend and family member

i bought this because i did not want to spend hundred of dollar on a tablet for i really have no mplaints i am able to install thousand of apps browse the web watch movie and so much more for such a reasonable price
i always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire it is awesome and i love it i downloaded some game and i am enjoying them it is great for internet too definitely worth the price you get a lot for the money it had lot more option too
thumb up alexa work great regnizes voice with no problem
from out the box she wa absolutely wroth the money a perfect addition to my tech and home
good price for use perfect size for kid battery last a long time
it is a great technology device and the voice regnition system work great i can ntrol my house thermostat and yard sprinkler system from the echo echo can also be setup to ntrol the lighting in the house a well echo also provides some entertainment for the kid when they ask her random question and receive mical answer i have to say it is really nice to just read my shopping list to echo and have it on my phone for when i go to the grocery store i have also done away with my alarm clock in my bedroom and use the echo a my alarm clock and weather station if it is searchable on the internet echo can usually answer your question even though it still need some fine tuning it is still a wonderful new piece of technology
purchased for my granddaughter they both loved it i also purchased light starter kit so they cannoturn their light on in their bedroom using alexa
great to have my entire library with me and no i can read in bed with the backlight also
great roku tv wish i had a separate remote for local channel
the best tv box fast and hard i love amazon thanks
great tablet fast and easy to use got it a a black friday sale thinking it wa going to be a slow out of date tablet but wa surprised at how much i like it and use it no lag no bug ha yet to freeze and great battery life
i bought two echo one for my wife and one for me i expected something along line of siri and google that uld follow many mmands you have to say very specific mmands to get a response also echo cant distinguish mmercials when one of it mmercials me on it try to answer question when it hears alexa i have also been trying to set up my wife is echo to do phone calling but cannot pull up her page to setup the option but it is not there we like it but still trying to learn all it can do
once you learn how to use it you can have some fun with it plus it can be educational
what a fun new helper and fun accessory to use around the house play music play game with you order pizza and much much more
the price is great the feel of it in ur hand do not feel cheap

love the fact that it ha parental ntrols to manage the tablet usage
download is slow but after it on the tablet it work great good buy

my daughter enjoys her kindle lovethis product
between listening to whatever song we want to telling my kid a short bedtime story with their name in it we love it trivia crack is fun to play too
led to more echo dot and significant home automation
after using the fire stick for a few month and loving it i decided to give it to my sister and upgrade to the fire tv for myself worth every penny the fire tv offer everything the fire stick offer but it is so much faster and ha more than enough storage anyone would need the microphone work great the menu layout is improved and far better than the menu layout on the stick i have the th generation apple tv and i barely use it bc the new remote is terrible the sensitivity pad on the remote is all over the place the home menu is boring the only advantage the apple tv ha over the fire tv is the seamless integration with other apple device such a iphone and my macbook other than that the fire tv is far better and i would remmend it over the apple tv any day
heard about the echo and had seen it on tv absolutely love the product very fun
i got this to mplete my home automation and i use it to listen to radio and music wish it is a bit cheaper
i like this tablet great feature and functionality for a good price
while definitely not a necessity it is nice to have if you do not like going to the redbox all the time
i love these because they are able to be programmed and watch anything and everything in the world
this thing is pretty awesome thank you for the fast shipping
is limited doe not play your own playlist is ok
i enjoy being able to ask alexa to play music tell me the weather or give me the latest headline on the news all while i m walking around my house totally love it
i got this for watching movie on the go i just put a bunch of movie on a micro sd card and it play them good value for the price
transitioning from paper to e reader ha been difficult for this book lover i had to do it because my briefcase and arm uld only carry so much the quality and the ease of reading what you want when you want make this the only book that i need
so much difference on viewing all the apps on k up scaling wa excellent unbelievible
this is a great tablet my nephew really enjoy using it
this fire tv work great for playing some game and streaming ntent it is a plus that it is k enabled have not really been able to use the k so cannot mment on that
this tablet is fantastic it is small yet biiger than my iphone it work fast and i have had no problem with it so far plus for the price you cannot go wrong with it it is more than half the price of a samsung or ipad yet work just the same do not hesitate to buy this
with this device you no longer need anything but wifi
very productive product naught for my daughter and she love it
the kindle wa bought for my nine year old grandson for christmas he wanted something to play game on and watch you tube work great no issue would remmend for any age great price too
this is my third one do not use anything else for reading book
bought the kindle paperwhite a a gift for a friend he love it and u it daily it is great for reading outside during the day even in the south florida sun and the adjustable lighting is great for reading at night or in dim lighting
i am very happy with this device i have tried many different solution to get to a good rd cutting setup and this is by far the best from cheap android stick to roku to chromecast to small form factor pc this is the best mpromise between size performance and price we use it primarily with playstation vue but also with amazon prime interestingly enough it ha beme our preferred device for netflix a well even though netflix is built in to our samsung tv the bluetooth remote is very good even though the voice search alexa service are little more than a novelty to be truly useful amazon need to open voice search to other apps i d love to be able to say watch cnn on playstation vue my biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps for example there is a free cbs app for android but the app for the firetv requires a subscription yes you can side load apps but that defeat the simplicity that make this device great similarly the lack of google play movie and google play music is regrettable on a side note if you do not plan to play demanding game the new firetv stick quad re is just a mpetent a device a this one for le than half the price but i cannot remmend the old firetv stick one little advertised feature that i absolutely love is that the device will also connect to bluetooth headset awesome if you want to listen you a show in bed without disturbing others
serf all my need in a enomy tablet and i would recmend it to all
after opening several gift on christmas my year old grandson kept going back to this gift and playing with it he wa very pleased he love his kindle fire and play game and doe his homework with it too
great screen a little slow at time and screen touch uld be better
i wa also skeptical about buying the amazon echo because of the price i wa able to get mine on sale for i wa not sure how much i wa gonna use alexa turn out i use her everyday from weather to traffic nditions on my mmute alexa is quick and responsive when she is paired with smart bulb and other smart accessory it is really nvient to have her alexa is easy to set up and worth the buy
i really enjoy my tablet it doe everything that i wa looking for in a tablet easy to use and small
bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them i like the parental ntrols and the apps
i am glad i bought it it is easy to use and have given me good book suggestion

it is a great tablet it doe lot of thing it work great with school work
we love alexa awesome speaker we have remmended to many friend and family
i purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet i wa so wrong i uld not even get it set up for him to use it before you mment that it may be the user i have set up every electronic device i have purchased for myself or my child mpters cell phone lap top game system this tablet would not connect to wifi i even took it across town thinking it uld try that but still nothing maybe it wa defaulty equipment i sat right beside him and had perfect wifi my other son sat right beside him had perfect wifi
echo doe exactly a advertised it will tell you the weather joke and some fun fact using the skill you can add different feature and for the most part they work for it to really be big it ha to ntinue to add feature that the everyday user ha an interest in if you do not get the wording just right echo will not carry out the mmand in the skill set you always have to start with a mmon phrase to get it to understand this uld be a pain because if you forget the exact phrase it will not work overall a great product well made and ha great potential to be the star of the home automation
internet suck on this thing they need to do something better my phone is x faster
i have several device i uld read on but i like to read outside on the deck at the park by the pool etc and i cannot stand glare the paperwhite is perfect for reading outside it also ha a backlight feature so i can read in the car at night or in the bed without disturbing the wife the paperwhite is the perfect e reader if you want something with no glare very lightweight and one that work seamlessly with amazon a a prime member with kindle unlimited my kindle paperwhite is my go to reader for everything

i recently purchased this product for my nephew for his birthday he love it and you can set parental setting to block unwanted ntent
best firetv yet show k and p ntent well amazon prime member get extra benefit
if you love the idea of having all your book in the same place at all time you should get an amazon fire i purchased this tablet for my fianc because he read ton of book now he doe not have to remember where his book are because he can now have them at all time on one device
i bought this primarily for reading but being a tablet it is able to do so much more i can listen to music download movie and check email i love it way better than my nook
great price and bargain especially if you have amazon prime it work well with it
i am still disvering what my echo is capable of and learning more each day i do wish it came with the battery pack a i thought it wa rechargeable
bought it a a birthday present for my son and he love it easy to use and work fast
i love this product it work great and for a great price
so glad i got this awesome addition to our house
this is a great addition to my expanding smart home the speaker sound great and alexa is very responsive
excellent product at the right price for those with light sensitivity this product is perfect
this is a great product suitable for all age i love using this because of the i find something new everytime i use this i would grade this an a plus
we are pleased with our echo alexa is very useful we utilize her to change the temp via our nest setting multiple timer is extremely helpful when oking and we play music via spotify and check the following day is weather almost every evening
if you have an amazon prime acunt this is a must have lot of free show and movie to watch and lot of apps to download also a great way to have tv in another room without the need for another cable or satellite box because it run off your wifi very small so it help in keeping a nice clean entertaining alternative
to start with this is not a high end tablet this serf the fundamental purpose of browsing and reading with so much ease believe me a lot better than an a low end asus tablet i own multiple tablet of varying brand this tablet work like a charm for the price offered it worth the purchase
this is a low st tablet it offer many of the same feature a higher priced tablet good buy
my year old love this he cannot break it with the thick rubber case and we can ntrol the game he play and how long he play great mix of educational and fun item the only problem is the charging rd is a bit too easy to break if they pull it off the charger it make the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge
my son enjoys this tablet a it is kid friendly and easy to use
i would remmend this product to anyone that is interested at this time
neighbor ha one and just love it so i bought one
the amazon echo is great she know and understands majority of mmands i have not used that much but from what i have seen so far so good got it on sale xmas season
you cannot go wrong for the only thing is that the graphic and speed are not the best
this is my send amazon fire tv i like both first and send version of the aftv unless your programming is broadcast in k you wonnotice the picture quality of the two version it ha all the apps you will need and available to sideload if it is not available thru amazon voice mmand only work with downloaded apps overall i like aftv over rd gen apple tv
after experimenting for several month with an echo dot i decided to take the plunge when the echo showed up online at a deep disunt like the dot setup wa easy sound quality is awesome sometimes it work too good a it listens to everything all the time it going to be fun to use just the same
grandson wa so happy pleased with the fire tablet he wa able to download start playing within minute of purchase would buy another if the need existed
have several in my home and my dad wa intrigued by them and how they can be used for the smart home got one for him for father is day and he love it first step for him in setting up his own smart home next is the samsung smart hub hue bulb schlage connect and nest thermostat
this is a great kindle for kid to use a it is very user friendly and once they get the hang of it they will not put it down
wa initially ncerned that it would take a lot to set up the echo but it wa easy to get it all going and very easy to use really glad we went ahead and made the purchase
just what my niece wanted for christmas she is enjoying every minute use
after having been an apple tv user the older version of which i have i decided to go with the amazon product because this one support fox sport that is the only reason i chose it but after using it i have no mplaints at all i have not yet looked into streaming from mobile device to it yet not sure if it is possible or not either way i d remmend this to anyone looking to buy one of these device
this it is a great tablet for kid it doe a good kid and keep them busy
bought to replace older kindle fire perfect for what i need use mainly for e book apps web browsing and streaming occasional movie show
been waiting to get alexa for year and not disappointed yet it ha a lot of feature already and i like the fact i get weekly email about new feature they are still adding i would rate a five but nothing is perfect
this is not a top level tablet but it wa not designed to be one it is nice to have a toss in the car backpack etc one that performs reasonably well and you do not have to worry about it
great learning tool with extensive amount of material to use accident proof bumper a big plus
the amazon tap is outstanding there have been more application slowly beming avaliable it is simple to use it work with our nest which is a nice application
this is a great tablet for anyone to use this is a wonderful product to purchase
what a difference and got a super deal before christmas the new kindle fire not only doe uhd with my monitor the interface is really nice i think it is much better than the roku i have been using and the roku that uld not regnize my uhd hdmi port it would only do p plan to buy another to replace my roku for a p tv nice
this is my first tablet and so far it ha been great game and apps all loaded fast and worked great wish battery wa stronger but i use it around the house a lot and plugging it in is not a problem and it charge fast
i have nothing but good thing to say i have had no problem with the tablet and it keep a great charge got it for a great price

i bought this tablet because it wa on sale and i had heard it wa a good entry level tablet it is quick on the touch response camera is decent but not the best it good to view video
great for kid ha many application that can help kid learn more and easier
got this over the google home because i felt it wa more refined than the google is offering thwe most useful feature imo is the ability to play music by just saying what you want to listen to not having to search through your own digital library or cd is the other is the home automation which is great and very simple to use
bought this for my son and daughter in law for christmas had so much fun asking alexa question when we visited especially useful for weather forecast before heading out for a day of sightseeing
love the fire tv it is fast and reliable i have all my movie tv show and apps in one place

i bought this tablet over the holiday when it wa on sale it ha been a great tablet the battery life is great on these new model also playing game everything move smoothly since it ha more ram the durability of the tablet is great this thing wonbreak if you drop it the only thing i do not like is the fire o you cannot get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available
i needed this for my two six year old to be able to use during our drive to disney you are unable to get most apps that are offered on itunes and android market so i returned

i do like some thing about this but i still believe it st to much
this is the send kindle my daughter ha been using and it been good
it is great to read in any kind of light there is a tiny bit of bleeding at the top edge but nothing noticeable unless you are actively looking for inperfections make reading easy and accessible in a light for factor
this unit is a must have in your smart home setup i got this unit because i wa very unhappy with my google home that i purchased prior alexa ha a whole lot more smart home integration than google home and is very easy to set up it ntrols my light and other device in my smart home and i wa able to implement it with very little effort i would definitely remmend this product it is a great sounding speaker a well for your home if you would like to connect your phone and stream thing like pandora also it is great to have in the kitchen it doe nversions from cup to quart etc you just ask it the question and it give you the answer it is very easy to use i would definitely remmend this product

offer a lot for the price good parental ntrols
the price may be attractive but not worth to buy after seeing tab like ipad nexus and others you would not be willing to use it a the display is just x pixel touch is not very smooth not so good customized apps game though there is a way to install all android apps the build quality is good though
this item the amazon fire tablet is a great buy for the price
bought a a gift for spouse we are just beginning to explore the function but seems to have a lot of capability
i paid for the kindle in reward cash were applied at the kindle fire is a steal the inch display make the x resolution appear crispy like any hd the educational game i purchased is fun and noticeably working the parental ntrols are solid and his profile includes a safety browser with pre bookmark added to disney tv show and his favorite thomas friend you can add in the kid netflix setup and share ntent easily between our profile

it is exactly what i needed a plain ol reader no lor no apps just book and i can read outside
my child really enjoy this tablet we have tried other brand tablet and those were not too kid friendly even though they were kid tablet and i found them a little advanced for my child is age so this tablet wa perfectly age appropriate and with a bigger memory than the previous no mplaints

big echo big sound no need for a bluetooth speaker

while it is mostly a way to sell you more stuff it is very useful and you can manage the temptation with discipline
this product is very nice i bought it a a birthday present and the person love it
so far i am happy with the amazon echo i have not used it to it full potential yet but it is very nvenient
i like the echo a lot mostly because of voice automation with alexa i have had my echo dot from best buy too since last november about eight or nine month and i like it for my bedroom but the added speaker on the larger echo device is much better for listening to news or music if you turn on the start of request sound though it is not a loud a the one on the echo dot which is both good and bad either way i like this device and i m glad i got it for only with the added protection plan
i purchased this for a christmas gift to my niece she is learning a lot from it and it keep her occupied with the game she loaded to it smart choice for first time tablet and it a great brand
i purchased the amazon firetv to access playstation vue thereby reducing my monthly st of viewing from to other package viewing option available at affordable sts the firetv is k mpatible providing a great picture with my k and non k tv no noticeable lag time with transition between channel or other option and it can be used for st effective free streaming i now have more very affordable viewing option than i ever had i love the amazon firetv and would definitely remmend it to anyone

perfect device for gaming apps and on the go streaming
i wa looking for an affordable tablet for my kid this wa a great buy
i put a memory card in this and put the play store on it google it i use it a a mini office with a bluetooth keyboard i love it
most people buy this for use with amazon prime but that is not absolutely necessary a there are many other useful apps that are available
awesome little toy back light ea up the use at night but also doe not affect screen quality in sun light
this is not a cheap feeling a i thought it wa going to be it is definitely not in the ipad class but it is not bad for what it is i ordered online and did not have one in my hand until mine arrived pro the screen is decent sound is loud enough for me no lag scrolling and real racing play smoothly n the major down side is battery charging time battery life and built in storage space when it arrived it wa showing remaining after le than hour use it had to be charged i just read where it cannotake hour or longer to charge my ipad air can fully charge in a few hour from built in storage is not enough yes you can get micro sd card however some apps will only install on the built in storage also you can not delete amazon apps without voiding the warranty and unless i m missing something you cannot move them either so if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing email watching movie reading book and the occasional game this should be just fine keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage but you wonbe doing any serious work on this like you can on the ipad is but to be fair this is the price of my ipad air and the st of an ipad mini but i do not believe it is meant to be a direct ipad mpetitor because if it were it would fail miserably
i love alexa do not tell my wife she listens and she give me answer without questioning my motif
bought this for my daughter to use in school she love it product work great i also bought the older version for my mom and she life it a well
i wanted them to have a tablet and after reading the review and price of the amazon fire i wa very pleased

i purchased two for my grandchild they carry the kindle with them everywhere they go great purchase
i love my kindle paper white and the versatility of it i can read it inside at night in bed or outside sitting in my swing with the sun shining brightly it is very light and easy to hold i also like the size of it and how it fit in my purse so i cannotake it with me wherever i go
have not had time to play with it but am enjoying the music and some of the quiz we played during a party
very basic tablet which i purchased mostly a an e reader it is battery life is quite short a a reader it is poor in the sunlight i d remmend if the price point is important but you get what you pay for
i really enjoy reading and on my ipad wa hurting my eye this kindle really work great
this device ha exceeded my expectation so far i love it
my son is little standoff y alexa other then that we like it
we bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning there are so many possibility with this it is way cheaper than an ipad and doe basically the same thing
i wa looking for an easy and functional tablet for my parent for christmas they are learning how to use it

last christmas i gave my nephew a fire stick which he loved in the meantime i purchased an amazon tap for myself since he like gadget i knew he would want one so i purchased it for him
i wa looking for a tablet that i uld download movie on for my toddler to watch on long car ride this kindle fire ha great parental setting so i do not have to worry about my child accidentally buying thing or seeing inappropriate ntent this run much cleaner and faster than older generation fire i wa a little taken back by the size since i have a much bigger one but it ll work out great for what i wanted it for i did notice i have burnt out pixel but they do not bother me enough to return or exchange
you get what you pay for wa not to happy but for a year old it is ok
throw it in the backseat for long car ride and you re golden
echo is a great price of tech for the household from playing music ntrolling outdoor light to answering numerous question the kid have so much echo can do and they keep adding skill which are apps for it no brainer
i wa looking for way to cut st from a raising cable bill and a friend suggested i try the amazon fire at first i didnâknow if this wa something i uld do once i wa able to maneuver through the process i love it
an apple tv wa out of the question lacked access to prime video and forced me to rent from itunes rarely offer disunted rental leaving me with roku or the fire tv went with the fire tv to try something different owned rokus before and have been very pleased the ui look great the voice search is reliable and ability to access so many apps easily make it easy for others to use

i use this a a large mp player you can buy a memory card to expand this unit i put in gb card and have put is of song and still have not use up all the memory unlike my ipad that fill up fast and ha no way of expanding the memory
we had another smart home hub that wa not the echo and it broke down twice so far the amazon echo can do more and doe not glitch out it is so worth the extra
this is not the best tablet but for casual gaming youtubing the price wa perfect for this tablet on black friday
i bought two of these for my two grandchild age and they love them they are able to read book and play game on them they were a great christmas gift so much so that i bought a third one for my son in law and he is thrilled with it the small price made it great for gift giving
we purchased the echo originally when it wa first available for prime member only at the time it felt like a novelty toy and didndo much since that time it ha had major advancement in it is capability we now use it to ntrol our light music a well a a personal digital assistant i recently purchase one for my parent for christmas and they re loving it too

i bought this tablet for my little nephew and he loved it perfect for downloading apps on the go and keeping the kid busy on the road easy to access the wifi memory is ok but i knew that buy the st would remmend for basic use
new to streaming tv but amazon offer many good channel and feature easy to set up and use
i have the echo and echo dot and use them all the time i highly remmend them
one of the simplest tablet probably out there only good for those that want to get into amazon m shopping good value for bargain proce
who need a laptop when you can do almost anything with the kindle fire
tablet is easy to work with only can be slow to me up on certain site
mpact light and extremely easy on the eye when reading
this wa supposed to be my back up travel type tablet it ha a display that is much better than my bigger tablet it start faster the touch screen is more accurate even at twice the price it would still be a bargain
this product is amazing i am electronically challenged but can use this item maybe not to it fullest potential but i am learning
i purchased this for my father in law and it work perfect for him good product for the price
i purchased this for my youngest grandson age for christmas and he will be receiving it shortly game have been downloaded and it will be charged and ready to use when he open his gift
the first of these failed after a week or so with line in the screen i took it back to bb and they replaced it with another i wa able to automatically reinstall everything i had on the first with no problem i love this device i bought it to download and read book from my library but it doe much more it notifies me when i receive mail and i switch from a book to it and can read it on the device and then easily switch back i can also do a lot of research that i normally do on my pc i highly remmend it
i absolutely love this tablet i love the price mpared to other tablet on the market plus the display look great at first i wa a bit skeptical about how it ran or if it wa any good but i actually read a personal review about the amazon fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it the article wa very helpful to me if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here http www quikrev m fire tablet display wi fi gb includes special offer black
went from nook to kindle love it awesome item love it
so this is more than just another electronic gadget first the sound from the echo is way above average not sono is but not far off send is the ability you will have to make your home a smart home echo will be able to ntrol your light plug thermostat garage door sprinkler system etc some of the random feature are fun like tell me a joke or sing happy birthday or what is the weather like in dubaiwell worth the price
this would be a great tablet even if it were picking it up on black friday wa literally a no brainer i saw it looked at the price picked it up and bought it it is great for all age user not great for graphically intense game but if you want that you need to pay for it for a casual everyday tablet also great for watching movie on the go you cannot beat it
this product is amazing i m loving it no needtouch and connect all the time
tablet get the job done and is very affordable for those who cannot buy an ipad but it is laggy at time and overall cannot stand with an ipad
the grandson love this tablet to watch church

i currently have two fire tv in my home prior to this i had an apple tv which wa the one before the newest generation of it became obsolete with slow streaming speed all the time after purchasing the fire tv i can honestly say it the best bargain in town the price is just right and ha not been an issue in speed or clarity for streaming all your favorite movie show the ease of use is also a big plus i highly remmend if you are on the fence
this is great for reading i can adjust font and brightness i can also access email and download apps sometimes it is slower than i d like but for a inexpensive option it is not bad at all i bring it with me all the time

i received this a a gift from my husband it is great for reading gaming and watching netflix
very satisfied with the product i have one for each of my kid now and for that the price point is amazing i have a pretty big beef with best buy in store customer service at this point i ordered a different lor to help keep my kid kindles separated between them the lor i ordered for my year old came in but they sent the gig rather than the gig instead of giving me the lor my year old ordered the customer service agent behind the unter absolutely insisted that they uld not do that and canceled the order making me take one of the lors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my year old son who did not get the lor he had wanted very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchase with best buy
nice product with low price i will remend to my friend working good
i toyed with the idea of getting an echo now that i have one i love alexa she life in the kitchen alexa set the timer for minute using ifttt m she integrates with my nest thermostat my rachio watering system etc she let me know when stuff from amazon is ming she is there to answer question but she can be annoying when jeopardy is on the tv some ntestants with the right voice will give their answer remember the answer is a question who is queen elizabeth ii and alexa will tell you all about queen elizabeth ii how can you not love her
amazon typically make good quality product for a decent price so this tablet on sale for wa a no brainer plus it is easy to install kodi and the play store without having to hack the device

how magical is it that this alexa know the answer to all my question she never seems to offer anything outside of what is asked of her and give only a specific response to any query i pose awesome

a great price and lot of free game my grandson love a wonderful pa time with all in one book and game and info
at sub the kindle fire pretty much fall under disposable that said it is a fantastic little tablet good enough to do almost anything you would want to do only downside is the mono speaker it is a little of an issue when listening to music over the speaker if wearing headphone the sound quality is ok and you get stereo
the table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense i would remmend to others

i bought a new mobile phone at bby and got a gift card a part of the purchase so bought the echo kind of on a whim i am not a huge technophile so i wa not expecting to really love it setup wa ridiculously easy connected to wifi then connected to amazon spotify and google calendar acunts now it all voice mmands for question music and my girl love asking alexa for a joke i also connected it to my wemo switch and it work well i am still learning the different thing i can ask her i almost gave it four star because it take a little getting used to with regard to which question you can ask or how to phrase a mmand for the best result but in the end i decided for five star because i am fine tuning the app setting and preference to make the experience better
great gift for the people who have it all i gave one to my year old dad and he love the wealth of knowledge alexa ha to share i love my amazon echo especially for the music very easy to set up and use
bought this for a year old great for kid for game and movie

wanted too try something different instead of apple this purchase is amazing some show are down loaded in full k amazing picture great purchase
excellent value great apps and movie the price wa perfect
i have the kindle fire hd so when i bought this i expected something up to that caliber or better sadly it did not in my opinion the older one is better in sound quality the new one is lighter but i did pay le for it
the echo wa on sale for marked down from so i decided to buy it i have the google my home but alexa is better it ha word in it vocabulary
we switched from an older model tablet to this simplified kindle fire for the price it is a decent reader which is primarily what we were seeking but it ha it limitation the primary user in the house used it to read before bed he feel the lowest brightness setting is still too bright so he default his book document to black screen however word in italic default to the screen background which mean they are black doh he also doe not like the persistence of the washington post popping up on his home screen he find it a bit annoying however he doe not mind the ad and suggested ntent from amazon at all it is just the washington post that he doe not like beyond those minor thing it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader being amazon prime customer we share ntent between our acunts with ease now that we both are on kindle platform
easy to use pretty user friendly it is good value for the price
it fit just right in your hand light weight love it
alexa work a lot easier than siri alexa is more like an personal assistant work great
we were given our first echo a a christmas present last year and since then we have purchased a echo dot for our guest room and this nd echo for our master bedroom the sound quality is terrific and we love the nvenience of getting quick question answered listening to music and being able to stop start at will and the overall memory capability of the echo we purchased two and will give the nd one to a relative for their christmas present
this wa a gift for my niece is birthday she love it plus the kid safe
great reading device under all lighting nditions
my wife just opened this for christmas she is enjoying it so far look and operates a good a any we have seen recently so far so good
wa a little skeptical because it wa so cheap but a perfect tablet for my year old
it is small light and easily portable powerful enough for all your basic tablet need like streaming reading light gaming and internet browsing perfect for a child is first tablet or on the go use
watching the ad in the beginning i wa skeptical on how useful the echo would truly be in my life but once i opened it and spent a little time adding thing like skill which you find in the app and can enhance alexa beyond belief i quickly realized how much i love this device i have it hooked up with my harmony remote a logitech product that i purchased from best buy along with any and all other acunts i have such a pandora iheart radio etc and now i find myself asking alexa to do almost everything i e alexa play some artist station to alexa turn on my blu ray player tv apple tv radio this device i cannotruly see is the beginning of where home technology is headed
i mostly utilize this for music and light ntrols who doe not want to feel like their in star trek tng
the google note is a lot fun and it ha a lot of built in knowledge
have connected it to my smart home and now am able to manage light security and temperature with my voice or smart phone mine is in kitchen and it make a wonderful device to time oking and baking and it play my music
i love my amazon box it is easy to use and with the right internet connection there is no buffing or waiting for movie to download i mpared it to the apple tv for the overall money this wa the better purchase
love this gadget play music make grocery list tell me the weather report
so many way to use this easy fun and helpful to have around
lightweight e reader with backlight work a advertised
only reason for not giving star is that there is no separate profile yet
i understand you get what you pay for but me on amazon you make million a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup the only thing this tablet is good for is llecting dust in my opinion if any mpany is going to integrate the androidos at least make it user friendly and open it is basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device
this is nice tablet with great function great for reading book fairly easy to use on the web lot of apps available
this is a good inexpensive tablet it is only a little heavy and doe not have a good camera other than that the rest ia very good
it is doing a great job just go for it without doubt
i love this kindle the battery life last for day
very ol note much oler if you have amazon prime because you can stream music free great gift
very durable and keep my yr old entertained i have to limit his use lot of apps game that inrporate learning very age appropriate and safe no worry on what my child is being exposed to
the fire go where you go the greatest attribute is the size perfect to bring everywhere
goog i would remmend this to a friend i like it
no issue work a good a ur internet no buffering
by far the greatest tablet for kid free time is fantastic i do not have to worry about ntent for my child and the two year worry free warranty is in heard of thumb up
great starter tablet but let is face it it is a kindle at heart still it is pretty awesome for a kindle
i m glad that i bought this product it is easy to understand my grandkids love it
ha every feature a android phone would have i mainly got it for ebooks and it work great for that however if your ming from a io device i do not suggest switching to this
this product wa perfect for all my need it is very very easy to use i would definitely remmend it
i just prefer live tv when you purchase these do not forget to buy an antenna so you can watch network tv and local news
the amazon firetv is a good roku replacement it doe push prime and amazon fee based ntent but the fire tv is smooth and ha some nice feature like alexa when you push the microphone button on the remote free game and voice search overall it is a pretty ol product
perfect gift for the grandkids they have great parental ntrols i would remmend it for anyone looking for a great gift for any age
this device is very responsive and uples very well with an amazon membership
i got this tablet for my year old granddaughter she enjoys it and it keep her busy and learning everything rolled into one for her
i actually bought this for a friend i already have one she love to read and i thought this would be perfect for her to download book on she absolutely love it for that plus all the other feature she can do on her tablet such a great buy
i love this tablet but my only mplaint is the battery life it suck
love alexa dependent upon good wifi when it work it is a great item
i am an amazon prime member and decided to take advantage of prime video and prime music i recently cut the rd on cable and subscribed to slingtv amazon fire tv work great with slingtv and many other apps listed in the description the menu design is simple and easy to use it is a great purchase and you can get even more out of your amazon prime membership with the amazon fire tv
easy to use solid build sharp hp screen for movie who need more
i hate the ad they are annoying and you cannot get them off it is super nfusing how to even get to the home page
perfect size reader beautiful screen for video viewing
the recipient of this tablet u it often and love it so much that i m buying one for myself
i bought the fire for my year old for school after a suggestion from the sale rep in store went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered uld not even download free kid apps why would i want my child able to accidently buy something i refused and thus not able to download anything we will be returning it product appears best for an adult who like to read book on tablet
i bought it a the display for my echo turning on voicecast route information to the tablet with the voice reaponse it is been exactly what i hoped it would be and the price wa right
she regnizes the mmands they say she will regnize however you either have to scream at her very loudly or being very nearby if you want her to hear your mmands
my nd one they work great
i love this great extra for my amazon echo doe everything it doe but it is rdless keep charge for many day push button to activate wireless speaker also out of wifi really ol
purchased this after extensive research between the echo and the google home i must say that this is surprisingly handy weather update in the morning and news headline read back to me is pretty ol the echo is very expandable with all the skill you can download to it to make it even better with it knowledge there are some thing that the google home doe better a far a it answering google is search v bing some question and it is better at interacting with the person speaking but i feel that amazon will be learning to do the same thing with their future update
great product and like the feature of it it make carrying a book obsolete
my wife previously had a nook that sadly broke due to an untimely drop we purchased the paperwhite and she cannot say enough positive thing about it she love how quickly it connect with an author and the other book they have written the light doe not keep her up all night but she can read without having to have all the light on so at least i can get some rest we highly remmend the kindle paperwhite
once connected to your phone this is an easy to use and amazing speaker sound quality is awesome and it answer any question you might have love alexa even give me fun idea when i m bored
for the money the best tablet you can buy i bought a bunch of these for my niece to play with i love my kindle and for the money it allows them to do a wide variety of activity
alexa is a fun product we use it to set an alarm play music and find out about traffic only downside so far is that it sometimes doe not understand u especially if there is other surrounding noise also the other product it can ntrol are very expensive
being a dedicated apple user with an iphone ipad mini and macbook air i didnexcept to buy an android or fire which u an o very built on android tablet but with this fire tablet being sold for just during the holiday and some of the google apps i wa most interested in play music offering different functionality on android fire tablet than on io device i thought i d give it a try after using it for week i can say the fire is easily worth more than it look great work well and is light and easy to handle the downside are that the o seems a little slower than io on my ipad and the wireless router doe not seem to be a powerful
had to take first one back because the screen went haywire the send one is doing great love how much it hold
i bought this for my wife she love it i would remmend this to any one who want a small tablet that can do about everything
since moving to the fire tv have not missed directv this a great product loaded with feature that is very easy to use
enjoying it immensely remmend to anyone perfect size to carry in your bag

lot of program that i didnknow wa available quick easy setup and hour of free entertainment
i love this kindle i should have purchased a long time ago
this is a decent tag along item to go with the echo it doe the trick a a stand alone a well if a speaker and alexa service is all you re looking for only downside is if you also own an echo when you push the button on the tap to speak to alexa since she is always listening on the echo she tends to pick up your mmands on the echo a well be sure to place the tap a decent distance away from the echo otherwise this doe what it is intended to do
i love this product and use it every day easy to set up and connect to
good for kid brightness is not so good
bought this for my son to enurage his reading and very pleased with this device i have sideloaded the ability to rent library book and it work well he can read easily without tiring his eye or needing to go to library frequently since i have to drive him everywhere it helped both of u i wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically

love it it is almost perfect still need some work on learning but that will me with time right now it is a novelty but who know what is to me
it is difficult to understand the instruction i am still working on it
not only doe what siri doe but it take it one step further by mpleting task that you ask it to do like ordering pizza or ubers which i do plenty of with extra device hooked to light in your home for example you can ask echo to turn your light on dim them etc before entering the home this can be a real safety feature
i would remmend this to anyone that love watching movie

i bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that i decided to get one for my ten year old i thought she wa spending too much time engaging in mindless activity on her phone and mputer and thought this might be a good alternative she ha responded surprisingly well one feature that i really like is the dictionary if she me across a word she doe not know or cannot read she cannotap on it and the dictionary will pop up defining the word this enables her to use her inference skill to dede the word or understand the meaning better this ha been a nice addition to her bedtime routine
love it but ended up returning for the hd would remmend it to anyone
working efficiently no mplaints so far make reading fun
my mom ha short term memory loss and i thought this may assist her the most important ability that we need from the echo is to easily put thing into calendar reminder or timer and then easily retrieve them i think there wa an update for that ability i have not had much time to set it up yet with what we have done with it sound good play music give direction good dictionary will do more and update this review i really hope that it can help my mom thanks sidney michelle

i bought the amazon echo for my husband because he love music i wa expecting the sound to be okay but not for it to sound a good a it doe the speaker are of excellent quality he is very pleased with the quality of the sound a am i even though we use the amazon echo for mostly playing music telling the forecast and adding item to our shopping list to be perfectly honest iâ d love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and i hate having to unplug and move her
i am an amazon fanboy i ll say it right up front this device although nice currently ha limited function especially nsidering the price tag so until more useful function linking to google now for instance are added i can only give my echo a much a it pain me to do so an average rating nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you do not mind waiting so see if useful function will be added but without android syncing and function or the ability to ntrol for example tv channel it is far from amazon is usual gotta have it right now category
work super well always play good music and movie
it a good product at a good price i got it for my year old and it serf the purpose
for the price you should be able to use a a speaker when talking on the phone i had to use my daughter is beat pill for this function therefore it is not worth all the hype
the longer i have this product the more i use it my most useful feature is the list capability i just say alexa add to my shopping list and when i got the the store i m able to pull everything up it make life easier for sure highly remmend everyone to have one

amazon echo ha been a great product we are able to turn our light on and off get the news sport and traffic and even schedule calendar event just by asking alexa to perform the task love this product cannot wait for further integration with our home
with this you have someone to talk to and answer you

pro is many you can integrate and use easily with spotify sirius and wink just to name a few great for news and weather too n is for the privacy nscious this is not your best friend a it listens for everything just to catch the word alexa and the following mmand for example if you mention in a nversation the word alexa it will do whatever me after

having family member who lose cable all the time this is a great deal reliable cable for the iphone at an affordable price plus the various cable lors allow me to assign lors for a person or charging station so we know when someone barrow a cable
i wa looking for the amazon echo for awhile and best buy had a great price so i bought it do not know why i waited so long to buy it use it so much i bought a amazon echo dot for my wife is business we like it a lot great job best buy
the amazon tap ha great sound and play most of my request easy to use and easy to set up
i like kindle obviously but i find the inch is bulky heavier and difficult to handle by someone with carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis it is easier to see the screen on the but i prefer the smaller screen because it is better for handling with my arthritic weak joint grip i do have to admit the bigger screen is better for watching video and movie
brought this to replace a tablet that my girlfriend lost it is perfect for her it fit her hand and she can still do most of the thing that she did on her old tablet way to go amazon
i started with the dot and i m glad i upgraded the sound quality is way better she hears me when i call her name it is a big difference
my son love this tablet no mplaints you cannot beat the quality at this price
alexa is quick and intelligent she can hear you from way farther than i expected music and audio sound great a well
i already have apple tv but bought the fire tv since it is so highly rated for another room so glad i did because it is worked out great for le money than the apple tv
alexa is a very good product it is nice in appearance and style voice quality is good and clear alexa should offer more product to folk who do not have amazon prime just to keep interest in the product it is a little pricy along with extra item you need to buy to get alexa to give more function
after using this tablet for a while i have found that i even prefer this size over my ipad air easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device the screen is just the perfect size for my older eye the screen on the fire is just too small and cramped and it seemed a lot le responsive i highly remmend this sweet tablet
this a great item for kid to learn how to use electronics
alexa is fun but not able to be customized to play your favorite song or tell wife hello hubby love you
i bought this for my room but my teenager wint let me use it they live i m thinking about getting another for myself
tablet is very easy to use and navigate the internet
way to set up easy to use add on apps are easy to install a well
i think that the amazon kindle tablet wa a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson very easy to operate it kept them entertained for hour while we were traveling on the train for vacation
a little more space on outer edge would be great i only use it for gaming and have had real problem at time it kick me out of the game popular game from ew otherwise great for what i do need more security but overall good purchase for le than
i never thought i d use the echo nearly a much a i do it ntrols our lifx light tv with a harmony light switch by wemu and connects to our vivint security system i love it it is really ol i bought one for my brother
gave to my wife a a gift and she love it she ha not had any problem at all with it
hard to connect to the internet extremely slow to load apps not many free apps like apple the only thing i really like is the protection it offer
i purchased two tablet a christmas gift and the child love them
purchased a a gift for older parent that wanted a wireless speaker that is easy to use the echo hit those mark
this is a great tablet at a affordable price it is perfect for the kid and a well for adult what you waiting for go to best buy and get one
i cannot wait to link my house to this device i m only using the factory setting and am thoroughly impressed
the amazon kid fire keep my grandson captivated with lot of activity he love that it is just right for his little hand he make sure that everyone in the family know the kindle belongs to him by saying it is mine
amazon echo is a nice buy but need to be fine tuned a bit
you cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet the only reason i give it star instead of is the limited app selection through the amazon app store if this came with the google play store i would give it a in a heartbeat overall it is a great tablet at this price point i would highly remmend it
slow with limited application battery doe not last long and the download speed is le than expected
i bought it for my usin and she love it nice and simple
the screen is vibrant and clear it is fast and doe not lag when going onto different site if you have amazon prime this is the tablet for you a it give you access to unlimited music movie and tv awesome purchase
i purchased this for my mom and she is totally in love with this reader this ha replaced her older kindle from about year ago and she appreciates the upgrade especially the built in backlight great product and a must buy for avid book reader
my daughter gave me an ipad for christmas had kindle before old one had broken screen not repairable on my geek plan bought this one for self for christmas do not need both
ha all the feature i needed and more than expected i opted for the gb but needed more due to the amount of space used for the many apps overall a great buy
great alternative to an internet connected gaming tablet for a reading device for kid to use in bed at night
i use this device to watch playstation vue and slingtv amazing device it stream slingtv more smoothly than my xbox one also the quality of video hardly ever drop if it doe it my internet and not the device great for the price remmended
it sound great work great and it is sleek i remmend it
some channel do not me in a clear a others but most are pretty good
i preferred reading hard py book but now am liking the kindle better it is easy to access book through my local library also like the size which is easier to carry around than hard ver book
full disclosure i own five amazon echo including a few dot a well a this tap so obviously i m a fan of echo honestly i uld not figure out from amazon marketing and the online review how the tap fit in a mpared to full blown echo and the dot i kept thinking it wa limited mpared to the echo and the dot because you had to tap the button to ask it question however given that it is mpletely portable and run for up to six hour on a charge it make sense that it would wast battery if it wa always listening for a voice mmand imo the tap sound just a good and maybe even better the the echo in a much smaller form factor since it is portable it is probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table a you can ntrol who get to request music my friend and i get into fun war asking for different music on the full blown echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone play michael bolton over my bruce springsteen bottom line just a good of sound a the full blown tap in a portable and smaller form very happy with all my echo but this may be my favorite
trying to reach the minimum required character to get my point
i am happy i decided to go with buying the firebox i d first decided to buy a fire stick until i had read more about firebox and all the other operation it ha functionality it ha mpared to the fire stick it wa a no brainer
great tablet i bought two of these for a yr and yr the parental ntrol is an awesome feature no regret whatsoever
i purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use she love it it is easy to navigate for her the only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated she doe not have internet at home so she ha to wait to update her apps when she visit family who ha internet service
she love reading book on it and it is very easy on the eye
the kindle i currently have is pretty nice i did however have to send my first one back a it stopped working after day awesomely though best buy shipped me a new one free of charge even though it wa past the day return policy
great product great for kid great for game
my wore out my is much better allthough the vers are expensive and screen protector are hard to find the battery life is exceptional
my grandson really enjoys the tablet it work well i love would definitely remmend it
perfect size so easy to carry around long lasting battery life would recmend
i love new kindle fire i love the nvenience having book with me all the time being able to have an entire library at my fingertip
it wa working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt me on
christmas gift for yr ended up returning too slow and not enough ntent for our yr old kid great yr protection tho
better quality then most tablet in same price range i still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it ad on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it function like it supposed to
though i have got it for cheap price during black friday this fire is not that great very bad camera and dim screen resolution pro install google play without any hasslevery good book reading option
nvenient to use cannotake it with you when traveling
i enjoy how small this version is although if you are looking for a lot of feature i would remmend other kindle product pretty much this is similar to carrying around a paperback book in size and portability
wanted something not expensive but rather easy to use to watch child show great choice
tablet is great value i brought two for my kid and they love it later i brought one for myself just to have a light entertainment device on the fly the resolution on the tablet is good but do not expect the resolution of a samsung or apple tablet i like the amazon interface because you can download certain movie or show if your a amazon prime member i do not think amazon prime movie or show are available on non amazon tablet so this increase the value some people do not like the fact that the locked screen ha advertising i think it is great it is a clever way to bring a product to the market that is affordable reliable and built well
good product work amazing work awesome from home
this a very good little tablet for my young boy to use
the best kindle fire ever love how quickly the apps run being able to watch movie listen to music etc on it
really like it but alexa search u bing which is very limited mpared to bing on line wish you uld choose different search engine i like google over bing thinking of getting tap a well
my child love their new amazon fire tablet quality picture and sound
this product is totally worth buying it is perfect for someone who like to play game or read
easy to set up and lot of great function can play music summary of the news link in for the smart home

good deal great product a nice little addition to our home
i like it a lot easy to use a big improvement over the original the price wa increideble black friday special onclude a camera front and rear the quality is not a good a a cell phone but is ok
it is pretty good for the price i bought mine for my kid to share and use for this price you may just want to buy one for each kid since mine tend to fight over it the charging port on mine seems to not be working well have to push it up to connect properly but the kid tend to just rip the power rd out without any care you may not have the same problem
we use our echo to ntrol our interior lighting a well a to set a timer playing music getting the weather and general information oh and the shopping list is a great feature
the amazon fire hd is great much faster than the fire
great music and fun to test her knowledge amazing how qickly she responds to any question cannot stump her
great product good size for travel we bought it for our girl we use it when we travel and put it on the back seat so she can see video or movie
bought this kindle because of the great price good thing because i dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked
get lot of apps and show with a speedy menu nice quality of the stream from netflix and amazon great purchase
not sure what to say about this except the jury is still out
bought this a a gift for a child they love it for playing game and watching video
had the fire tv stick for awhile and decided to give that to my parent and get this for me and my wife both of u were blown away by the difference between the two so much faster loading everything amazed at how when you choose a video to watch and hit play it there instantly amazing
this is not a high end tablet do not buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet game but for general use for most people web surfing light game like angry bird and those match the fruit game casting movie to a television it is an amazing value the amazon geared operating system is not a problem it took a few minute to get the google world onto the tablet google play google store google this and that the version is an even better deal but my mom needed this slightly larger screen she love it
like the small size and nvenience recharges quickly and is available when my lenovo tab need to be charged
easy to operate for any age i wa amazed that even the four year old handled it like a pro

amazon is alexa program is surprisingly intuitive and the microphone can hear me from across the house this product worked a lot better than i initially expected it to
or at least a future i d like to be living in let get this straight a a prime member you can get this for at that rate think of it a a wireless speaker that you can just issue spoken instruction to an alarm clock that you can shout at alexa shut up in the morning and it will obey you it my half asleep morning power trip set a timer for when you re oking fact check your friend while you argue with them pso my mmon use case aside here is what is good about echo speech regnition work really well esp for brief phrase it can hear you from pretty much anywhere in the room and is pretty accurate with the wake word i have been using alexa a a music player it really nice to be able to just ask for a song by name and have it just me up without having to hunt through a playlist connect to the bluetooth speaker etc purchasing music is pretty seamless a if amazon needed another way to get you to spend money iheart radio integration if you re into that kinda thinghere is what is not so great speech regnition for longer phrase need a uple of attempt maybe because of my accent e g alexa play the song the trouble by u a a music player it a bit lacking in bass sometimes while it playing music you have to use the wake word once or twice to get it attention bing search really roll eye i d love to see in the future integration with fire tv so that i can simply say alexa play the soprano on my tv google search being able to send a message to a friend in my contact alexa message xyz blah blah blahoverall it a pretty ol product and i d love to see what it look like over time
i got this for my wife and she love it she is old school and like her toggle button on the old one however she like being able to read anywhere at anytime the back light is not over powerful i wa happy to hear this because i wa not sure if i should have got the one that auto detects ambient light
if you have prime and netflix this is what you need voice search is great on prime
wasnt used to an amazon wa used to android this product is good just wasent used to it
bought for my son for christmas and so far he love it good value for the price
i love it alexa usually know most of the answer worth the money
we recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is year old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at christmas i would remmend this rather than more expensive tablet option for a child it is worth the money and very user friendly
we have gotten new kindle every year grand child love them
got this for a present for someone and they love it they really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that is why he love it
i bought this for my son for christmas and it perfect my son get to play his game with easy access to amazon prime ntent

alexa turn out to be a great source of local information a you re waking up getting breakfast ready ha a great library of song just for the asking the gift that you d pick for yourself
the amazon fire tablet is a pretty solid tablet reader for a very low price reading ebooks is very mfortable and there are some really great apps available through amazon is app store the one drawback is the web browser it is a bit sluggish this tablet is great if you are looking for an e reader and the price is outstanding but if you are looking for an actual tablet mputer you should look elsewhere do not buy this expecting it to perform a well a an ipad it just is not that kind of device overall though i really like this
great for my year old for game and the like spending at amazon to remove ad is worth it do not like that you have to turn on tracking from some of the free game from the amazon store
did what i needed it to do took back to get a bigger size

all i have to do is speak and i have music and news it keep me mpany

i have so many different apps that i use to watch my movie and tv and this device group them all the remote make searching a breeze and alexa is entertaining to talk to i would get multiple of these amazon is adding a lot of great feature to prime oh and i hope you have prime when you get this if you dont your wasting money get prime and get the fire tv

i received my echo a a gift i use it often for keeping list acquiring weather information and whenever i i have a question i gave this echo a a gift and the recipient love it a much a i do
the speaker sound is rich and loud even at it loudest alexa still responds when you call for her fast response and ability to sync with my product is exactly how i want it to work
i have always wanted to get the best product for the money for my audio video experience the amazon fire for k ha not disappointed it wa exceptionally easy to set up and attach to the internet and my tv the update for the fire are seemless and fast the visual quality is what wa expected if you already own the fire would i remmend the upgrade do not know but wish there wa some sort of buyback program and then the choice would be easier i do like the gaming ability of the system but have yet to explore those option extensively
granddaughter loved it it wa a present for christmas

my echo is so helpful and my whole family love it

i bought an amazon fire tablet for my sister some year back she didnwant anything more in her life that wa techie but she did love the large tablet and she u it a lot i got the amazon echo for her for christmas and it is a great mplement to the fire tablet with very minimal training minute she can call up music channel from pandora play her own music ask about the weather and lot of other stuff that she may not do but uld do it is very helpful to use the apps on the fire tablet to set the pandora channel and otherwise tweak the echo
my family love it how we can just ask a question and it responds and doe certain thing for u
this is the th kindle we have my wife had the older one she love the camera and the size
i thought the size wa a little small bit besides that it is nice and battery is good
the built in backlight is fantastic let you get a slimmer case that is easier to carry around
just a simple kindle doe not have the glass back
great display and lors easy to use very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps would remmend to anyone wanting entry level tablet
i got this a a christmas gift for my year old son and he absolutely love it it is very user friendly and i love the parental ntrols
so much more mfortable to hold than a heavy book
i have used one before and loved the size weight and feel
we purchase this for our son and he love it we are able to track his interaction online and he really love it
i use it for reading and i love it i uld take it anywhere
it a simple tablet but work great good picture you can do most the same a other major named tablet it work for me
offer much more entertainment very responsive no buffering time
would buy again first tablet having the time of my life with it
the amazon fire tv is a quality product at an affordable price le expensive than apple tv and more capable with a good app e system also able to stream uhd
very slow my year old mother love it i would remmend this to a elder or a young child
this is one kool little tablet i spent some time with these and really enjoyed what they offered the y make excellent gift for little loved one
i wanted one for quite a while caught it in dale and i am very pleased with it the battery last longer than my kindle touch from several year being able to adjust the back ground light make reading enjoyable in low light glad i bought it
the amazon echo is good it answer question a asked but need to be able to look up music without be linked to a specific acunt
i have really enjoyed by amazon fire it doe everything i need and is small enough for my purse
it is amazing my daughter love reading on it watching netflix going online to look thing up etc she love the touchscreen aspect and the setting are advanced but very user friendly easy to navigate lot of great feature for a very low price the only negative is that the camera is not the best quality but that is not important to her
i do not know what took me so long to purchase this item system offer everything that uld want for my tv experience in one package
i previously owned a samsung tab a a medium device for reading viewing listening playing the hd is fine even a step up in screen size clarity and ease of navigation however the proprietary nature of amazon is apps basically eliminates for me using it for work e mail document spreadsheet storage retrieval editing since i didnbuy it for it work capability that is fine but i think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential user at some point i will probably spring for a more expensive updated samsung tablet or window surface if i m feeling reckless and the hd will probably be passed on to my year old
it work a describe on the box i didnresearch a lot but i did read about it a little
i wanted something simple for my mom to use and this is perfect for her
we have one at home to we thought it would be fun to have at the office to place music however you can only stream alexa per music acunt which is annoying they should have a subscription package like netflix that allows more then one device to stream for a higher st per month if needed
my primary interest in streaming this wa new to me wa to stream the grand tour on amazon prime i figured an amazon device wa the easiest way to do this and i wa rrect the fire tv is easy to use and work great i have fast internet mpbs download so i have no mplaints about picture quality
i m super happy and very glad i made this purchase
for buck it is a nice starter tablet wish it had bluetooth but cannot really mplain at this price
great price for the kid to keep them entertain i love the price for this item it didnbreak the bank i would remmend this to everyone
my grand daughter love it and so do her parent very durable i d highly remmend this product
the tablet is nice but the internet source take forever to load so it is just easier to use a standard mputer or phone to surf the web or get on facebook etc
i bought three of these from best buy for my grandchild they were happy
i utilize my tap on my bedside table for wake up call playing rain sound to help me go to sleep set reminder for the middle of the night uh oh and play my fav music i take my tap to work with me a a rdless battery bluetooth speaker best of both world
i have had it with high cable bill and wa looking for an inexpensive alternative several of my friend told me about the amazon firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable tv bill i even had to be reminded that if you are a prime customer you get the amazon channel at no additional st with all the free channel amazon firebox provides being an amazon prime customer add even more channel to choose from and offer movie tv show etc now to be fair itï ½ï ½ï ½s not cable i miss cable but i donï ½ï ½ï ½t miss those high cable bill you can also link your netflix hulu and other acunts to your amazon firebox making it the only place for home entertainment although you have to keep an eye on the premium channel offering free day trial and remember to put a security de on your remote in order to avoid guest kid and other person from ordering a bunch of the pay channel provided on amazon firebox other than that i am one happy customer
we got this for my wife to take with her when travelling although she still prefers printed book she really like this reader and it lightens her suitcase nsiderably excellent battery life and a good screen

nice device wish it wa a little bigger easy to use and read ebooks
i bought this tablet for my daughter to watch movie on play educational game it take some time getting used to amazon is apps but so far so good it get star bc the camara take terrible picture
fire tv out of the box is great but by adding protols and search engine available on line you cannoturn your fire tv into a dynamic and nstantly evolving device that can find and play virtually any television show or movie that is available from anywhere in the world it is especially good a a base platform for steaming service like netflix you tube etc

i love my new paperwhite i had previously had a generation and a generation kindle this is a tremendous step up i usually use my kindles for reading on the beach i love that it is small and fit in my beachbag or purse i like the back light on it also if i had to make one nstructive criticism i would have liked the page turning to be more like turning the page on a book like the kindle app on my phone work occasionally if i do not hit the page turn in the right spot i get other stuff that show up not a huge deal but i would like it to be more intuitive in that regard
this is an affordable tablet and work well you just have to deal with a lot of advertising

i love this tablet it is the right size and i love playing movie on it
i bought this tablet for my son he love it he know how to work everything
the kindle fire tablet are great for the price they have solid performance in battery life and processing power the only downside is that the operating system is a different variation of android so there uld be some inmpatibilities
his is a very enomical entry level tablet great for kid or for first time user
excellent price point for feature rich product the screen is clear sound is passable i would remmend this product a a great buy
i wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so i uld look up stuff such a information about movie i watch on tv or answer to the new york time crossword puzzle or anything else i wa curious about i didnwant to spend much money but wa still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet uld be any good i decided that for a measly fifty buck plus for extra storage it wa worth a shot i found that it is perfect for my purpose relatively fast and easy to use i have not used it for downloading or the like but my guess is it ll be ok there too i m happy i bought it
easy setup and easy to use i get new weather and traffic before i get out of bed to look for the remote
ok i will rate your echo your echo ha great sound to play all your favorite spofity song it can give the hour to local restaurant provide the weather and rny joke you can call or text your contact on their mobile device and call in from mobile device a well the voice activated echo doe these thing and so much more your echo deserves a solid star

i uld not be happier with the functionality of alexa she also ha a great sense of humor
enjoying my item with member of my family and friend
the amazon echo is a well designed well built product within a defined set of parameter it work pretty well and can be integrated with a number of home automation product to make it more useful in practice though it is vocabulary is limited and it ai is pretty dumb so do not expect too much
great way to get awesome ntent without having cable highly remmended but not for beginner unless you are good with youtube
alexa is very easy to use i just plugged it in downloaded the mpanion app and wa surprised how much it uld do with a few voice mmands i highly remmend it for beginner in home automation device the more i use it the more intuitiveâ it bemes i am going to purchase one for my yr old mother too
we have one for each of my child so i bought this one for my mother they are amazing tablet especially for the price
this wa a great price for a entry level tablet it can do all the thing i need it to well like netflix and checking the weather
hoped this fire hd would be faster than my old hd fire not so much i guess i expected the new fire hd to perform better but it still lag and is slow to load information while surfing the internet my wife is ipad is light year ahead on this one but what do you expect from a dollar tablet
for the price it is a great tablet not a good a an android but still good

i really enjoy today is electronic gadget and this is a really nice addition to my llection
my wife love her kindke and at this price it wa a no brainer it is fast with a ton of expandable memory storage
i like the tablet however there are occasion when it doe not boot up when it is turned on i probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed
i needed a tablet to play game watch movie and so on while traveling i didnwant to spend a lot of money this tablet meet my expectation
for this is a fine tablet however i bought a gb sd card to expand the storage however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card nor cannothey save data to it for example netflix so be warned that you will run out of space and nsider the one with the larger internal storage
this kindle is really good for the price screen is too small for me but for my daughter it is perfect doe a lot of ol thing
purchased this for our yo she love it had to return the st one after just a few day a the screen would go black after typing in password periodically however best buy traded it out for a new one
bought this item with high expectation of it capability it would be extremely lenghty to supply full detail let me just say that technology is not there yet with ai device like this
great assistant but doe not know it all certain thing you ask get no response
we bought this for our yr old granddaughter and she love it it ha so many apps and video for her to watch i would definitely remmend this to anyone who is looking for a tablet for a child

hey we bought this for our year old grandson and he love it very easy to use and very durable
one of the best product ever created love alexa
at the price it is almost an impulse buy i wanted a tablet for an upming trip to watch some movie read etc and this wa at a price point that made the decision really easy if you are used to an ipad the fire hd is a little disappointing but it sts nsiderably le it fit my need but i felt some slugginess and several instance of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work rrect if you go in with the understanding this is not an ipad replacement this should fit the bill for you let is just say after my trip i purchased an ipad pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my child if you have amazon prime you do get some nice perk that make this a really nice item
excellent purchase satisfied my need for entertaining television
excellent product for the price larger screen light weight easy to download apps
this is my send amazon fire my first wa the inch and love the new hd
well worth the for a nice tablet it fit the bill nice display no frill

i love this tablet i bought it for my year old grandson and he life it the parental ntrols are outstanding

good inexpensive tablet that vers all the basic
but even better with kodi love the k the remote uld be better
i previously owned the previous model there is very little difference between this and the older model apart from the k which only work with netflix at this time i still hate the ugly interface i wish amazon would allow user to use their own skin
the kindle is the best ebook reader i love it and use it daily
i bought this tablet for my senior citizen mother and it is easy for her to use
i needed an item that had le glare and i uld read at night without backlighting
great product highly remmended great value and great price
bought this a well a the roku ultra both are great product no issue whatsover if ur a bit more advanced fire tv is more modifiable a it based on android while roku isnt but still fire tv is very simple for the basic use of even my year old kid alexa is a great plus only one downside is it doe not navigate within apps to ntrol the apps themselves it only ntrols fire tv main feature while in roku the direct netflix button on the remote make it slightly simpler to access netflix in short both are amazing product so if ur mparing u wont go wrong either way i would highly remmend fire tv and am very pleased with my purchase
amazing jail break and you get free everything tv movie whatever
in my personal opinion this product would be unable to satisify any adult whether it wa for business or pleasure limited apps limited space slow uploading etc also due to this being an amazon product many apps and option are unavailable that are mmonly used with both android and apple product so i would not remmend to anyone
headphone port did not work at first but after a hard reset the worked
the echo offer many selection in music and local weather status this device also provides current news report and connects to my amazon audible acunt so it will ntinue reading a book to me that i had already started
bought this for our year old daughter and she love it easy to use and kid friendly
greet tablet to red your favorite book wherever life take you with this amazon kindle
the lors and surfing is just great size and connectively is great child love it make reading anywhere a breeze
price wa fabulous for an entry level tablet right on
i have always been a big roku fan and have a few amazon fire stick but decided to give this a shot i am much happier with the fire tv over the fire stick the processing power allows streaming home video to be much smoother than the stick and the updated interface is now better than the roku
i wa a hesitant buyer of these device until the echo dot wa given to u a a gift it is fun to use but we wanted a louder and better speaker so that is why we bought this happy so far
for the price it cannot be beat the screen is not the best quality but for the price it is sufficient
gift for my parent easy for them to use they loved it
perfect for my son he ha fine motor deficit and the game definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them i also do not have to worry about him getting onto anything that is not kid friendly since he doe not know my passde for the adult profile
love it would remmend to my friend and family
amazon is ipad basically and better in my opinion
an exceptional product which can be upgraded with product in the future
this is a great product i m not sure if the charging port would mess up like a cellphone but we ll see i do have an issue with best buy i returned it on friday because it would not charge anymore i realized on sunday and they uld not locate my sd card they pretty much summed it up like it wa my lost
work great better then cable i would remmend to everyone
i have not used any other kindle before but this kindle wa made to do it job and it doe it properly it is sleek lightweight and sturdy i love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever i go just in case i get a chance to read like it say in the description you can download book and read it anywhere you do not need wifi to read battery life is great it ha a matted screen and you can make the font a big or a small a you want the down side is that the screen is small so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen also there is no brightness ntroller for the screen so you can only read it where it is light but i honestly love my kindle it doe it is job and i do not want anything that get is fancier than this
work great if you plan to have it in arm reach you have to physically tap it to ask alexa store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told u you had to tap not voice activate returned to wait for indefinite out of stock echo to get in eventually
great product lot of fun for the family i would highly remmend
i have had an amazon echo since it came out and i love it i recently purchased a google home and found at this moment it is not a good a the amazon echo i m sure the google home will get better over time but right now alexa is the best the sound that me out of the amazon echo is better then the google home plus you can connect bluetooth to the echo but not the google home this black friday i purchased another echo and a few echo dot dot are a great price and i uldbe more happy
by far the best tablet ive ever owned easy and quick set up
a rating of start is what i can give this product the fire hd show a nice picture and is used mostly to watch netflix however the fire hd will restart when the battery indicator is at i am not sure what is causing the issue or why
great addition to my alexa llection very portable batter last a expected
great aesthetic look and performs well you have to read what alexa can connect to worth buying at best buy
i read review for all the amazon echo product and decided the portability and the full size of the tap made it the right product for me it life up to my expectation it doe last all day playing music answering question although my accent must give it some problem a i get a few i didnunderstand that mments from alexa and setting timer alarm and list i picked the tap because it ha the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio and can be recharged overnight
bought for my yr old he love it easy to use great product for the price love using it
cheaper than the paper white and ha more ability
upgraded from a galaxy tablet that wa year old so worth it

i love my echo i use my echo for just about everything i have set up my light my tv i also ask it several question almost every day my wife u it to get oking measurement i play music and game a well

with the outdoor antenna and fire stick we were able to get rid of our direct tv
this device offer a wonderful way to read book without creating more clutter in your home the device is also easy to read even in the sun unlike by ipad mini
great way to get book quickly and easily battery life is good
the battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the amazon esystem youtube and twitch would drain the battery in under an hour but if used a intended it would be great for book and email

i have bought many of this during chrismas time and it a good tablet for a age
this wa actually my send purchase of this tablet overall the finish is good everything work pretty fine it ha all of the amazon service that you need like kindle amazon music the touch screen still ha some delay however once in a while they put it on sale for if your not in a hurry like if you already own a tablet and are not really in need of a send one then you can wait because i believe at the price of this tablet is unbeatable

i love that my son love to read and all so the kindle is perfect for him it update and is very easy to use i do not like that it is a fragile a it is my year old ha plenty of electronics but the screen ha already cracked on this one i m not too happy about that

this wa purchased for my grandson for christmas he is so in love with it great price and quality will probably get another grandchild one
i love this tablet it doe a lot more then my previous one which st almost time the price
bottom led lighting is a bit uneven and a bit distracting but the overall package is otherwise excellent for reading and without all the tempting distraction on a nventional tablet so one can really focus on reading the ppi is really crucial for image and especially map and diagram
do not like that amazon ha so many ad going on this thing make it pretty not fun to use
i like the tablet only thing is im not a fan of the amazon app store wish it had google play
this wa the perfect gift for my daughter she can play game watch movie and browse youtube now i can officially have my phone back
i started with the original kindle and it worked great but required good lighting the paperwhite is so much nicer a you can use anywhere and in any type of light perfect
my daughter picked this tablet after her hd fire battery would no longer work the insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the hd she wanted more memory for her music doe not use it to watch movie really she love the blue lor and is working just perfect for her
bought for kid happy with purchase may get one for myself
i use it mainly for sling but i do so much more with it and i love the remote that i can speak to alexa

very easy to setup and use still learning to maximize the usage the instructio is too simple and not ver much using alexa
really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service great
got this for my daughter and she love it i also use it a a e reader
the amazon hd is by far the best budget tablet if you just need a tablet to browse the web and watch video this tablet is the way to go that being said it is fairly slow but who care if you do not use the tablet for photo video editing gaming picture taking etc
i purchased this since my smart tv uld not connect to wifi anymore overall it work well wa a little expensive but the fire tv stick were all sold out
purchased two at christmas for my niece and nephew they love them they re safe for kid to use and easy the only thing i dislike is the lack of ntrol because of the fire software versus android but it is all good
i only use it for display mirroring but it will work for other thing that it is intended to do it work good
interesting ncept to have alexa playing music for me ordering supply for me catching me up on the weather etc one issue experienced with alexa at this point is the inability to access the kind of music i want at the time however we are working on it
for you cannot go wrong even at the reg price of i would remmend this to anyone doe everything i need it to and more web surfing email and book all at your fingertip the ability to download game etc is just an added bonus prime is not needed but work great if you have it i am forgoing the purchase of a case because at i uld just buy a new tablet if anything ever happened to this one thanks amazon
happy i bought this make everything easier to ntrol
if you love music or any kind of general information she can find it for you have it there and a quality of the sound is over what i expected

purchased this for my year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one everything wa perfect easy to use and set up she ha zero problem using this for online and reading book
it is a really good thing to have a round the house
for the functionality and price it cannot be beat why pay more for a sub par off band tablet when you can get a trusted brand make a great gift especially for little one and you do not break the bank
great product for the money and a newbie who ha never used a tablet
i enjoyed it looking forward to adding more thing that are mpatible with it
the light from the page doe not but a strain on your eye when reading i like how light it is to hold
i bought this to replace a samsung galaxy tab i absolutely love the kindle hd it wa easy to set up and very easy to find my way around the only reason i took off star is that i have found some apps are not available for kindle but so far from info i have read online there are way to resolve this issue
the fire tv is fast and reliable with the ease of setup and expandability of this product it is a no brainer buy
this tablet is great for game and book good size for travel

the amazon echo is very useful we have it placed in our kitchen where we can ask alexa to set a timer play music or tell u a joke the kid love asking alexa question a well the only gripe i have of the echo sometimes doe not understand what we are asking or cannot find the answer
what a ol product and very easy to set up we have used it a lot so far and have not even scratched the surface of everything it can do highly remmend

i bought this for travel so i can read a much a i can without bartering and carrying book it is easy to read but the size doe not work for me i have to hold it with two hand i wa hoping i uld hold it in one in retrospect i would get the amazon fire instead
my yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera but after christmas best buy wa out of stock we thought this wa a good alternative she get from her grandparent so it wa her purchase since she broke her old tablet a well due to her being behind yr in school we set a hr limit meaning she had to read or do other educational game for hour before being able to play on it we also set a max time so she would not spend all day it wa really easy to set this up i wish it wa this simple on our other kid electronics so yes i had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera but some kid refuse to get outdoors so far a great buy
the amazon fire tv product is great highly remmend it to anyone best buy is service on the sale wa not i ordered the item online for an in store pick up the next day went to pick it up and they said it wa scheduled for delivery to a home address in day although they had plenty in stock their only option wa to cancel the order and redo the sale while this may not seem like a big deal it wa not how i wanted the purchase processed since i wa getting bonus mile with a specific credit card
great price on a tablet plus have always had great success with kindle
ive always used apple device but this little gadget is full of surprise
granddaughter loved it she began using it right away
if you are a invested into the amazon esystem a i am you can never have too many of these
bought this for someone special ha not been operated much yet
the echo is truly awesome alexa is a blast and can answer and do just about anything you ask the entire family love it weather sport sres latest news and ordering pizza truly awesome
alexa doe not always know what you re talking about but we love hearing her good morning quote and anecdote and the audio quality for listening to music is very nice similar to a bose sound
it is an excellent tablet however it is app store is not a good a android
i have four sibling and it keep them quiet day they re home
this is the fourth kindle i bought a a gift perfect for any occasion
i wa excited to get this because of the price after taking it home i started noticing thing that bothered me i use samsung device and the amazon app store doe not have a lot of the same apps even chrome would not work on this device i did return this because i wa looking for more than a bare stock tablet but if that is what your looking for it great
i m an owner of apple tv but for price and feature this amazon fire tv beat it highly remmend it
text is clear nice not to have the battery die every few day like a nventional tablet
we are enjoying amazon echo but have had problem trying to set up my husband and my music to play my husband had to contact amazon service department to guide him on setting up but we still struggled in getting music to play from our cell phone and our mputers
work great love it bought for a gift they really like it
we ditched cable tv and went to play station vue on a p two other tv is needed a way to watch vue review said the fire tv would do it and it doe it well i agree with those who said in some way it doe it better there is a learning curve on the remote for example the upper right button give you the programing guide in with a quick press after you have selected a nd program that same button with a longer press let you jump back to last program start up is a lot quicker than the p if you also have amazon prime the mbination bemes a real bargain
i purchased this a a drawing for my business everyone wa very excited about the prize
it great to use for you re everyday work and recreation
heck fifty buck for a tablet a name brand tablet that feel premium not bad for the money
i wa really surprised by how long the battery still hold charge when not in use screen is awesome for a low re
very good for me put it in my purse or use it in bed love it
got this for my year old and year old and they love it i have education apps and book that read to them or they can read along i would remmend getting a case for it if it is for the little one just to keep it protected
this tablet is great because you do not need a data plan but you can do anything that any other tablet can do maybe even a bit more the only restriction is you need wi fi to run it but let is face it wi fi is everywhere now
it is a great product strongly remmend a must have
my granddaughter love to play game on this tablet at the same time she can look for information on internet for her school homework another think i like about it is that you can use an sd card for extra storage it is very user friendly
echo ha surprised me in many way while the feature are nothing new the ability to access them through pure voice ntrol ha been incredible
absolutely love it no problem with it at all and great battery
for the price this is perfect i read book search the web watch netflix it is not an ipad but for the price it is amazing
for the price paid wa excellent the only n is that it is not a smart tv but it is hd would remmend
my kid love alexa the ntinued response alexa responds well to anyone is voice in our family there is so much potential to what alexa can do but unfortunately not something we can ntinue to put extra money into purchasing all the possible extra right now we ll just have to add a little here there
the paperwhite feature work great can read book in a room with low light
we have not had any issue with this super affordable tablet
this is my first streaming tv device and i am new to the technology it wa very easy to set up and nfigure taking only a few minute it worked like a charm i then downloaded kodi onto the device following a youtube instructional video while kodi take a little more patience and time once installed it is an awesome supplement to the fire tv between the built in service offering and the vast amount of free streaming service offered via kodi this device is a winner no more cable and satellite tv subscription for this person
i m really enjoying this device it let you cut the cable rd
frustrated that it ha a hard time understanding me
great product for all type of user great for reading or playing game
purchased these for a few christmas gift to give away
good first tablet or back up to take with you without hazard to a better one
after dropping my kindle with a keyboard not techie enough to know which generation it wa i did plenty of research before getting my next kindle i wanted a dedicated ebook a i do not want distraction when i read let is make this simple i have read in sunlight and there have been no problem with glare the automatic light make it great for night reading it took a while to get used to the button but after my last kindle this wa a feature i really wanted i like them i have read only three book on the kindle so far and i still have not mastered the touch of getting it to do what i want when i want i am fighting it to highlight and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter book which are feature i love excellent reader i would purchase again but i cannot say with any honesty that the extra wa worth it over the paperwhite but i have no experience with that model either i do like this more than my last kindle so that is all that really matter
so easy to read book from and play my different game that i enjoy the set up wa really easy did take a little while to get it going but probably more my fault than otherwise
i think my aunt like her new toy it is amazing how technology march on this unit is perfect a an introduction to the tablet for people even if you have other tablet this is a wonderful addition because you cannotake it with you a if it is a throwaway it ha the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack ha plenty of power and quality sound it support bluetooth audio also any gadget freak should add this to their llection
the kindle paperwhite is lightweight and easy on the eye it is the first device to allow me to read with a much mfort a an actual book
i prefer this kindle to the first one i purchased i like that it is similar to a mputer and i can see the lors and it is not monochromatic it lightweight which is great also
i am really enjoying my amazon echo it wa very easy to set up and very easy to use you just have to remember to say alexa first showed it to my sister in law while she wa visiting and now she want to order one
i cut the cable and my bill with ooma for phone is a month for triple play
perfect tablet for the avid reader great function light blue light filter to safeguard circadian rhythm so you do not have trouble falling asleep after being exposed to the light of a typical tablet easy to use and fit perfectly in hand and not too heavy for onext handed use
great tablet that work well for ebooks and basic apps such a internet browser etc great bargain for the money
i use to have the apple tv and i like the fire tv more due to the streaming and voice activation i have just recently purchased this item but the streaming is quick and it is very easy to maneuver through the channel i have told some of my client about the fire tv over the apple tv
i purchased this for my mother and she ha been going on about how wonderful the amazon fire is it is the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she love i would definitely remmend the amazon fire thank you
it is a lot of fun and my grandkids have a ball with it even my yr old cannotalk to it he ha fun asking for song
we like the battery endurance the new screen is great too
i read every single review for this ver before i decided to buy it but i am glad that i finally decided to pull the trigger i have never had a kindle or another ver so my review is based on a first timer is perspective this is my feedback i agree that this ver is expensive ridiculously expensive but after pricing other vers and other light then factoring in that i would have to buy replacement battery for any other light it did not seem like i would be saving much money if i bought something else plus the fact that the light is built in wa very appealing and turn out to be extremely nvenient yes the ver should have had a magnet or something for closure that wa the main reason for my initial hesitation not the price i thought about using a rubber band around it but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty ver which by the way is quite pretty in the wine purple lor i ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my kindle ver to keep the ver closed for additional protection and to prevent scratch because the ver doe scratch quite easily i agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratch on the ver because doe not that show that the ver is doing it job to protect the kindle but it doe sound like the same ver for the kindle keyboard wa much more durable it would be nice for the ver to keep looking fresh and new but i would rather my kindle be protected than for my ver to look perfect my little knitted sleeve is helping with that but i know a lot of people would not want to use an additional ver some people mmented that the ver added too much to the size and weight of the kindle reallyread more
great tablet for the price if you re looking for a cheap and easy to use tablet this is the one
this is an excellent tablet to have if you are not looking to spend too much doe not have ton of feature however it ha the main basic music web browsing email video movie gaming and reading plus if your an amazon prime member you can get great game for free like real racing and ducktales also great a a young child is tablet
i installed the echo and linked it to my ebee thermostat and hue light it took a little time but wa not too difficult really i have it linked to pandora for music and my favorite news station for my morning news flash the speaker is not the greatest for a true audiophile but it is adequate good product overall

it is a good reading device when the price drop to dollar it is a deal you need to buy one at that level
i love this sold apple tv including th generation
good bare bone tablet for anyone if that is all you seek do not expect the performance of a tablet for i have wifi bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine no lag on a reliable network this is an amazon based o not a traditional android system so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon acunt it even asks for your credit card but can be removed afterward all apps must be obtained from their amazon app store no google play store which is nsiderably simpler there are way around this of urse if you know how one more thing that is important and it is this after more than a week i finally noticed with more use that my screen ha spot with dead pixel which show up a solid white dot and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen after searching reading online it seems there are very many report of these tablet purchased from any source having this issue even read someone who purchased a pack and had several unit with dead pixel test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen you may be fine but it pay to look i did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though i still have the receipt i already discarded the packaging i am at the day point today and uld have still returned it otherwise but honestly for all i use it for i am not overly ncerned still whether or dollar a brand new item should be free of defect again so far i find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bone tablet is all you need
i own the kindle fire hd and love it this is a christmas gift for a friend hopefully she will love it great price
i bought one for myself and it is my first kindle just love it and got a send a a birthday gift to one of my friend
my nephew love to play with my phone now a anyone who ha been around small human know they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hand however if it a rare case where they do not they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum the kindel ha me to my rescue a it ha everything they need to be entertained and best of all it lack the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kid demonstrate murphy is law in action

just needed a small tablet for video and surfing perfect
i got in on the initial deal with directv now and after the frustration of dealing with the apple tv i received for free with the service i tried this box what a difference it stream k yes i have a k tv and performs everything fast it also ha all of the service i use forget the apple junk and pick this up
this kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier some feature i do not use so cannot mment on them all in all i love it the only drawback wa that the store had no vers that fit this kindle
i love my kindle i like the fact that i can read book or go onto the internet to look up my news definitely can not beat the low price for everything it doe
you can pay a nominal monthly fee for alexa to play ton of music i also have it set up for alexa to ntrol all the lighting in the house work great
you cannot beat the price picked this one up for only from best buy i like the additional ntrol parent have with kindles it is great when you want to limit your kid is time on youtube game etc i would certainly remmend this to a friend
i like this kindle the only this is it doe not read the book a good a my older amazon kindle fire

this wa a graduation gift to my son who is going to the th grade he love it and so do i he had a samsung galaxy tab and he love the speed of the kindle tablet
i have never had a tablet other than an apple it seems to charge quite slow but i m not sure if it is because of the tablet or the rd or some setting i m not aware of but it charge ridiculously slow other than that i am very happy since it is for my son
if you like movie it is worth it had to have a friend help u set it up but it work great
capacity limit is my only gripe connects quickly and easily to wifi and remembers wifi password until you erase them book many are free especially the one that you never read in high school check email even work with bluetooth keyboard cant be beat at the price
i have one of these tablet so it wa a no brainer when it came to purchasing one for a friend is birthday this tablet is small and delivers a multitude of function
absolutely love my echo in fact this is our send one for our send home whether you need want the weather music news update or just have a random question echo is the answer already have bought two additional echo is for christmas gift
first of all is alexa understand me well especially with my diction accent not like siri google rtana and other they are all nfused due to my accent but not alexa it answer all of my question and inquiry in anything actually we now have of this amazon echo home and work
this is one of the best tablet in this price range
bought this for my mom for christmas it is her first tablet she loved it and will have no problem learning to use it very straightforward and easy to pick up great storage fantastic resolution and really good feature
we are enjoying alexa a lot she is funny at time
it is a good tablet for a young kid a little hard to navigate even for adult cant figure out how to navigate the internet
cannot beat price wish the case would fit from last one screen smaller but for the price i think gret
my mom is not mputer savvy however she ha really taken to the tablet it is easy to u and just the right size for her to handle so glad that best buy remmended this product for her

it is not my first e reader amazon kindle and last model amazon kindle paperwhite is very very good
decent product not so much if you re used to android software you cannot get your photo saved in google more than half of my music llection vanished once the memory card wa inserted basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor exchanged it for am android tablet
purchased it for my daughter she love this very much it is really good
great tablet i have a i pad and i am just a satisfied with this tablet a i am with my i pad
i bought this for a family member who ha very limited use of her hand due to a spinal rd injury she life in a nursing facility my hope wa that she uld enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcast of her favorite sport team simply by speaking to the echo alexa device my big ncern wa that she would not be able to use the voice mmands due to her weak voice happily i can report that she love it and is able to successfully use the voice mmands we have it sitting on her night stand about two foot next to her and i know that she love it not only because she tell me but because i can see using the alexa app on my smartphone each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day i can even listen to the audio of each of her interaction with the device and i am not exaggerating when i say that she often interacts with alexa echo over time throughout the day so far she u alexa echo to listen to her favorite music through my prime music subscription we recently purchased a few song that she uld not find in prime music she also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside she say the staff at the nursing facility where she life seem to be amazed by the device a well and she often demonstrates it capability asking it to tell her who the current president is currently i am helping her beme familiar with it ability to play local radio station especially the one that broadcast kentucky wildcat sport game when i reminded her that it uld read book aloud she requested a chapter of the bible i found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actor on audible this product ha been a real revolution in my aunt is day to day life and the prime music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation i am giving it five star because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the alexa app give me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day my aunt hope that a future update will allow it to ntrol her tv and make receive phone call

i have always enjoyed reading i read to quickly and eventually spend a load of money on one book series this product ha already saved me at least and i have only had it for a month yes i did the math i love this thing
if you want an inexpensive device to read kindle book or do email this is it
the amazon fire hd is a great buy very inexpensive but delivers great quality give a rating and not because there are advertisement on lock screen some may welme the ad others not overall this tablet is great battery life is several day with very minimal usage battery last to hour with average usage including video
fire tv work great for movie and tv show download the kodi app and open up is of movie and show
great tablet for everyday use my child watch his favorite youtube video on it
i saw a one day sale on this amazon echo and wa planning to buy apple version in december but many review on this echo were above par speaker sound great and alexa wake up easy or stop when yo mmand so alexa still ha a lot to learn cause she stumble across some geological question overall satisfied and i plan on integrating other smart device with echo great best buy sale i only wish best buy would have sent email stating order wa ready i told a potshot at going there hr later but wa at the customer pickup so i didnwaste the drive
grandkids each got one and they love it step up from original kindle
dont have option for password ask you before buying apps once you authorized a allow it done not a many free good apps like apple have it
i love my kindle voyage however it doe not have a speaker for audio book and change setting ie remaining time page left in book on it is own
got one for my yr old she love it it is very durable i love that i can switch acunts and use it for myself too
i got this for my kid we use the freeplay for a month we added a gb memory card it is not an hd screen but it still look good and it is faster than other quad re tablet probably because it is not running heavy graphic great for casual use and child
no live tv but most of everything else is available and much cheaper than cable we re saving over a month by canceling cable and only keeping internet
this box ha a ton of apps and feature on it a it me and it get even better once you install kodi
very satisfied with this purchase my grandson loved it
purchased a a gift it wa a good choice it is a advertised
i got to say that love it make it easier to play music without pairing any device to it and perfect sound for my need
my tablet is the best thing i have gotten from you
i m a techie i love ol product the echo is a wonderful addition to the home automation revolution besides the home automation benefit the sound quality is superb for the size i love being able to play music change the volume and get update all via voice i would like to see some additional update to how you can interact without having to say amazon or alexa to trigger remmend it highly
size brightness and nvenience are good the option to link with android product for message is a little hard
wife purchased she said doe what she need love it
it wa for my year old she love it she wa able to work it very easily
we both got one and we enjoy it very much we both can read our book and play game it is great for traveling too have no mplaints here
i have bought of these one for my yr old and one for my yr old both of them have previously broken tablet before i am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform a super deal for a tablet i likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they re smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my ipad just a forewarning the kindle store can be a little wonky and le streamlined in aligning purchase i wish there wa a restore purchase button like in the apple store since i have bought stuff in game to have the ntent disappear i m sure if i were le lazy i uld call customer support though
excellent camerakids friendly battery last longer easy to carry
i have had the old kindle but love this one more it is a little smaller so it is easier to hold while using it great for playing on apps checking stuff online and reading book easy to travel which i love
i wa hesitant at first to buy it but now i use it daily definitely remmended if you have an amazon prime acunt you can watch movie and listen to music on here i bought the fire tv instead of the stick for future use of k ntent it also ha a micro sd slot usb port and digital audio port with the support of apps you can stream ntent from your home networked pc also
all the apps you need and they keep adding more and now with the amazon echo alexa you can ntrol your smart device by saying alexa turn on my light or tv or shade or music or lock i mean it is endless even my sonos get this thing apple or chrome cannot touch this at all
the echo is not very good at answering question it is good at playing music and telling you the weather i m sure it will get better but it is more of an annoyance with a toddler in the house it doe tell cute joke but it say i m sorry i cannot find that answer more often than not the sound is quite good from this model and work well with spotify
this is a nice tablet with quality that i would expect from a higher priced unit
this is a very well made tablet if you can deal with the amazon pre loaded apps it is very fast simple to use and the best tablet for the price
awesome tablet super quick great picture and overall great quality
i picked this kindle because i wanted the option to do other thing on it besides just read it is great if you re looking for a kindle you have the option to do a few extra thing on surf the web check facebook check your email etc for the price i think it is a good value
my husband is enjoying this tablet for reading and netflix
i really like this tablet because of the awesome resolution
i love my kindle i take it everywhere with me it is lightweight fit in my purse just great deal
there are free an paid game get the stick w voice
bought this for my mother in law who is having trouble reading small print didnwant to spend a much a a kindle paperwhite so this wa a reasonable mpromise to give her the option of adjusting the light and size of the font when she is reading
great product the entire family enjoys it work without any problem
is not a cheat and easy to break tablet and ha just enough of all the apps for me
the screen is ol much better than the basic kindle very similar to the kindle voyage if you want a really reading experience you need a kindle
is part of my family we love my new amazon echo
it a good tablet with very nice screen and function a with amazon fire tablet you are stuck with apps on amazon and you may not get too many variety and good quality apps if you are ok with amazon apps this is a fine nice tablet if you need good and verity of apps go for android tablet
this product is no different than the fire stick in my opinion it doe have more memory and an option where you can add an sd card to it but other than that it is the same a a firestick no reason to pay twice the money for this box
i had a kindle year ago and decided to try one again i m so glad i did the lighting seems to make it easier for me to read and see the word without my reading glass i with i uld put my own screen saver on it and wish best buy carried the case in lors
ordered it for a friend so that he uld do his bible study n play game n read book he love it
if you are a hardre reader this is your kindle the light make a huge difference to read under any nditions it a big improvement from the standard kindle if you are unsure between one or the other go for the paperwhite it worth the extra money
it is good product i like best buy excellent service
bought this for my son for christmas he broke his tablet last year hopefully this one will last longer
it wa just a few week ago that i wa bemoaning the fact that i did not sop up an echo back when they were being released last year not only uld it be had at nearly half off the current price but it came with a voice remote and we uld have had a year longer using this amazing device well here i am a year late to the game and i can now proudly say that i own both an echo and this new little tap can i just say that i am obsessed with all thing echo and alexa these are device that you may not realize how much you ll use it until you have given them a try i have been spending the last few year getting our home automated i currently use a mbination of smartthings ifttt and logitech harmony to ntrol the home alexa fit right into the middle of all that and give u the ability to ntrol our home via voice for me this is the killer feature i can integrate all three part of our home ntrol right into echo tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup read more
the first fire hd we purchased died within week of purchase we had to go back and exchange it for a new one not a good sign so far
this is a great product and very nvenient it wa easy to set up and connect to my hue lighting the echo is ability to play music on demand is a great feature well worth the money for what it is capable of doing
work great sound good only criticism is there is no volume ntrol like the dot for manual adjustment
good product other than having to purchase additional apps for it to work
because my granddaughter is name is alexa i though it would be funny to get one for a gift i took me a few minute to figure out how to set it up but it worked well when nfigured it wa funny when somebody mentioned alexa and the halo answered when we had music playing somebody a a joke whispered alexa volume level and then we uld not the halo to hear u to shut it up i had to turn the top of the speaker to quiet it down i made for an entertaining time i will probably get one for myself
i bought this for a security camera display i downloaded the app connected the device and it is working out great
this kindle is very nvenient and ha a great display that is easy on the eye
this is a great easy to use tablet for the price
great tablet for the kid a it includes some good educational apps and ha a good case that surround it for durability
this is such a great product i am learning new thing to use my alexa for each day the game she play are fun and i especially like how she connects to all of our smart device to voice ntrol them would definitely remmend this to anyone

amazon ha been the leader in this space of voice regnition and with the aws engine behind it there is a lot of opportunity for development both from the mmunity a well a amazon naturally they favor interaction with service they sell so others will need to build link to others but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already the price of this tap wa outstanding adding it to my existing echo and now nsidering a dot
while i find myself limited at the moment to playing music and adding to my grocery list i look forward to expanding my connected home for what i use it for it is fantastic it even work great with answering question the kid have and responding quickly to need it understands fairly well and it hears me throughout the house

it is only a few week old but so far the tv is working great great picture no issue to report
i brought this for my year old granddaughter she love it she use it to do homework on play game watch video she love it
uld be faster get a little laggy sometimes but for surfing the net checking email game book etc it a great little tablet and you cannot beat the price
i upgraded from the fire stick to the fire tv and man what a difference it made way faster a lot smoother and overall just a better experience than the fire stick do not get me wrong the stick is affordable and doe the job but if you want faster and smoother transition from app to app the fire tv is the way to go
the description sounded like the base unit wa included with the ding game which it wa not
it is a little slow on some thing but otherwise i really like the tablet
the amazon fire tablet is awesome my kid love it
our young son spends hour fully engaged playing game on his tablet
i bought this for my year old grandson and it wa easy for him to learn and became his favorite christmas present
follow the instruction on youtube and you can jailbreak this item to get access to movie still in theater
still need work a it doe not always understand question and need more info installed so a to be more user friendly i got it on sale so decided to try it work very well with my wemo light switch and like telling it to play my music and set alarm for the price i got it for it will pa until they update it some more it is a work in progress
it is a great idea need some improvement lot of question asked it reply is i do not or cannot answer that
i remmend this tablet for beginner it definitely doe the job needed to keep little one entertained worth the money great price
great for kid the bumper around the tablet ha saved it several time i might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around the program are easy to access and love the parental ntrols
i bought two of these for christmas for my and year old and they love them easy to navigate and it keep them busy and interested for hour sturdy protective bumper protector keep your kid kindle safe the only mplaint i have is the charger doe not stay snug and one is already useless because it wonfit tight enough to charge this is not a problem with this kindle but maybe all of them i bought my oldest son a regular kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too not quite sure what the problem is with them
fire tv set up uld not be easier give u access to all out favortie streaming service plus additional apps
i bought for my nephew who is year old he is very happy
it wa not what i went into the store for but it is what i left with
doe what it is supposed to do
my mom wanted a tablet to read on i bought her the fire and she love it it is easy to use and inexpensive
i tried a few samsung table they were junk and i paid time the price for those this out preformed them fold and wa of the st still not quite an ipad but for the price there is probably nothing better free time for the kid is a great feature
i bought this for a family member with a disability i didnsee any review for this purpose but so far it is working well i felt the case would help if it wa accidentally dropped
i primarily use this a a medium tablet and it doe it pretty well the expandable storage is nice and it ha around hour of ntinuous local video play downside to this product are the bad external speaker and limited apps available but hey it is
this latest version of the kindle reader is great paper white is esp nice
mucch better than my previous tablet run great and fast best decision ever
battery wouldnt hold a charge but wa able to get it teplaced
my whole family u these tablet we love them and with prime it is awesome
alexa work very well and will connect to many of your automated home system there is a great amount of freestanding application a well
amazon fire tv is a must if you have amazon prime
enjoy the kindle just the right size and easy to handle
this item wa not expensive but doe a lot of more than tablet that st more i have purchased three with with two purchased last year with no issue
alexa doe what she say i have the echo and dot both are great i like the echo because of the speaker to listen to music i also appreciate the ability to check my calendar set alarm check weather etc
this tablet is better than any other tablet of the same st range my son saved up to buy his own tablet and had similar priced tablet break or have software issue this tablet ha a nice quality screen and it is nice to be able to not be forced to do everything through amazon despite it being an amazon tablet the option of a best buy replacement plan is handy when getting the tablet for kid
who knew you uld ask a smart device other than our phone sitting on your table the weather play whatever music you want last night final sport sres etc and you get a pleasant reply promptly a fun gadget for today lifestyle
the sound is not good but it wa easy to set up alexa itself his limited capability
i just wish it wa a little le easy for a toddler to get out of apps they ll be on a game or show and accidentally or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it close the app it need le sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddler and up the first one broke and i uld not tell you how it happened i think i had two of press down on it or something because i had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen wa mpletely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer since then i have not had any issue with the new one
this is my send amazon paperwhite ereader it is superb in bright sunlight or in a dimly lit room
clear reading in bright light outdoor setting long battery life
great tablet everything i wanted in a tablet thanks
nifty gadget useful and easy to carry around just enough performance and feature needed for a tablet for it price range i would remmend this item for those who wanting to try a tablet
this wa my first alexa device and until i got a dot i wa very satisfied with it after the dot i missed the voice activation no amazon ha updated the software to where it will respond to voice mmands so not problem with it at all you need to keep it on the charge stand if you are going to use voice mmands
i upgraded from a to an inch what a difference totally satisfied would remmend this to everyone i know
pretty much you get what you pay for not bad but not great but an inexpensive fix for the cause
my buddy got me this for christmas it is great to stream music my wife got me a prime acunt and we can now watch movie listen to music etc just by asking alexa
use it for taking picture of family for memory
just perfect for my child who is only year old
must have for people who have an amazon prime acunt and an echo portability and water resistant work great by the hot tub or pool and let is you access the normal alexis capability
this product is exceptional it understands voice mmands of the time it also improves over time with use
it is been prefect for my daughter to use for netflix
granddaughter love it these wa her upgrade for her birthday
i would highly remmend the kindle fire for a first time user it wa really very easy to learn to navigate
both my husband and i like to refer to alexa for information my husband especially like to have her set the morning alarm he is nstantly asking alexa to set a timer
great price easy access to apps simply love it
good if you re looking for a no frill internet experience very affordable
great for movie work better with a bluetooth mouse
the fire tablet is a good product from amazon they can be used in so many way a great educational product for a child it wa easy to setup and start using
it a great product the quality is awesome the picture is good and clear
this product is very nvenient for reading electronic book and the price is nice all in all a good product
he love to read so he will enjoy sitting down with it
i wa never able to get it to send play music from my iphone app it would only play sample of music from amazon
performs a designed got it on sale for dollar
this is a great upgrade with the touch screen but still with the perfect ability to read outside set up is idiot proof and very quick i like that you can have two acunts on it now a my husband u it also ha a very long battery life and is pretty rugged a i dropped a uple of time if you love to read outside this is the product for you
very good quality price ratio we buy this table for a little kid for a very low price and it is one of best deal for a very long time again very good for their low price
great product and for the price it is a deal you cannot pa up
great for playing music and keeping list have not tried all the fancy reorder item feature but alexa is feature keep expanding so the possibility are nstantly expanding
my alexa is so awesome while cleaning the house it is so easy just to say alexa play without having to stop and search for the song in your playlist or choose and pick which song you want my housework can get done so much quicker now and is much more enjoyable
good read with my new paperwhite kindle made my reading experience great
i have had a blast since i purchased this amazon fire tv i had issue with the remote but after calling they immediately sent me a replacement great service and i am nsidering reducing my cable now since i can do so much cheaper through this item now
i bought of the echo and gave one to my wife she really love the echo because the music
i chose this product from my daughter is this is a great product keep them from fighting and misbehaving i think everyone should have one for their child this is a great product to help them learn and really affordable the people at best buy were really helpful
i now have amazon echo unit cannot get enough of them great
kept my kid busy on road trip while i ok daily
i bought my step mom an updated kindle she read the new kindle more than her old one
i debated for over a year about getting a kindle after trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglass and sitting under an umbrella i finally bought my kindle paperwhite i uld not be happier and i have read more book in the past uple of month then i have in year it is a good a they say and easy to read in any light
very limited in capability i am used to using ok google on my phone alexa is nowhere near a helpful or intuitive it is more like siri wish it were easier to put itunes purchase in the amazon library for alexa to play that said i knew what i wa getting hoping the technology improved within a uple year
this is decent reader and netflix device lot of bug and gotchas when trying to use in going off screen random locking random performance hit while doing the same task returned buying an ipad mini the build quality is just not there
the paperwhite allows you to read in any light from the beach to a quiet night at home
i had a older version of this product the new version is far superior and a pleasure to use mpared to the old one
i got this to use directvnow and it work great
wonder product really enjoying it setup wa easy and the sound is wonderfully loud
of all the kindle reader this is the best one i love this small easy to read
great product the only problem is that my son is now staying up late to read book in his bed at midnight without light turned on
really like this tablet price is right and perfect for browsing the web and reading book the book on kindle are cheaper in digital format a well so win win all around depending on whether or not you prefer a book
i have been spoiled by apple i bought the tablet for my son so he uld have his own he still u his sister is ipod and ipad and they are year old i would only remmend this to family that do not own apple product
i bought the amazon is fire box and it is worth every dime i love this box i can watch all my movie and tv series on this box it also ha the voice search and it ha k ultra hd which show a great pic best item you can buy you will love it
i wa pleased with feature of this low st device
my year old love this tablet and i loved the price very easy to use with my amazon acunt
good for reading and surfing on the web good for game
great price bought it to work with home automation product but have not purchased those yet that is next uld not pa up the price and had point a well we bought one with multiple accessory for our son last christmas and he like using the automation product generally similar to asking siri thing in an iphone question wise i like being able to add thing to a shopping list and view then on my phone at the store still get several i do not know is so only star so far probably a learning curve on our part too also good for oking and nverting measurement quickly like being able to ntrol music and volume from my phone also glad we got it looking forward to adding the home automation product
bought for my wife she seems to love it link to internet and phone very easy easily understands voice from multiple people with different accent turn kitchen into an instant dance floor during oking
ok so when i got this tablet i wa not expecting to much from it but now that i have used it it amazing pro their is no lag at all when play high graphic game pretty easy to use very fast speedns in my opinion their is only thing that drive me insane the screen feel like plastic very unmfortable and the camera is not the best but it is good for everyday life photo overall get this tablet better deal then the galaxy tab s
i have not had such a reliable speaker before it is so easy to charge and so easy to start playing song right away with alexa you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone unlocking it and pulling up google m love it
so far so good i am absolutely loving this tablet and it durability neat feature and ability for the price
fun gift for adult child and their family bought three total for christmas gift
good size screen and clarity for the money seems fairly robust the biggest problem is putting apps on it at least free game they do not have a great selection and when i put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can llect information or they wonlet you play it
the internet server silk is not mpatible with free wifi on southwest airline and i bought it to use on the plane also i cannot hear the audio even with the sound all the way up on the plane so i do not really need it since i have a mputer iphone and kindle at home
i have had a kindle since they first came out and wa happy to get one with a backlit screen i like the wifi and the g because i like the freedom of downloading book and newspaper while in the car at the beach by the pool when another guest remmends a new book i still have not figured out some of the button and because it is smaller i am always turning the page i have adjusted the font and how far apart the line are but it still seems like i m doing more page turning
this wa a good pick for first kid tablet i just wish getting to their apps wa a little easier
the product wa fine i would definitely remmended to a friend
year old boy broke it in le than month even with the bumper guard on wonpower up when it wa working very limited on storage ran out of space in hour so the wifi would not work had go in and explain to him he uld not download more than a hand full of apps at a time doe not matter now since it woneven turn on or charge
great little tablet for the price got on sale at best buy for on black friday
very user friendly along with very low monthly st to gain access to amazon catalog
the amazon echo is a wonderful piece of technology she tell joke play music and you can play game with her too there are more practical u a well she can ntrol your wifi enabled household device like turning light on or adjusting the ac the equipment to do that is still pretty pricey but she is good just for entertainment the only bad part is she cannot push audio out to my bluetooth speaker i think the dot can but not the echo
ha been very good have watch more movie than i ever have in my life ha so much stuff on it i have not seen all of it but find something new on it everyday ha so much to explore
i will never buy this again very cheap not with a dime
love this kindle it is amazing for the price well worth it
easy to set up and use the remote is sleek and functional
it is got a lot of speed and apps my nephew love his amazon tablet
unit is nifty for some function it would be good with a prime membership i expect a little more usable ntent without additional purchase for the price tag still have not fully explored the unit
bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it
got this during christmas rush and didnthink much of it since it wa slightly open they had none in stock and needed of them for all my child upon opening item one had a small crack bearly noticeable increased useage of item cause the screen to spider web tried to return but no help with management store at fountain in el paso texas so i have perfect kindles and one cracked very disappointed star
i purchased this device because i had the stick and i loved it i knew this one ha a faster processor it would handle third party software better i enjoy this product it is really fun to use
this is a review for the echo itself since you cannot leave a review for it yet i received my echo march and i love it i requested an invitation for it back in the beginning of december i got an email from amazon a month later offering me the option to purchase it in january i am a prime member so i purchased it for right after i got that email it said it would be shipped out around the first week of april however in march i received an email saying they were able to ship it out earlier and they did so i waited month from the time i requested it i m so glad i bought it back then because the price for prime member is now anyways i personally love the echo my daughter love it more then i do i have a and a yr old and they all kno how to use it my little one try to say alexa play mimi minnie mouse so she can hear the mickey mouse clubhouse theme song i primarily got this for my daughter one of them is dyslexic and the other are on the spectrum so they need help with doing homework alexa me in so handy for this especially with spelling my dyslexic daughter mix up letter so this feature help her tremendously also being able to voice mmand alexa to play a song at any time really me in handy when i m trying to redirect my daughter when they are having a melt down my youngest is obsessed with mickey so if i say alexa play hot dog my yr old will freeze and change her focus to the music so for these feature make me happy also the music play very clear and loud in my opinion i didnhave any problem with the app until today it did seem off today however they are always updating thing so i do not know if that is what caused it to be different read more
i only use tablet for downloading book to read great for that although sometimes loses place
i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she love it so easy to use it exceeds our expectation in every way
we had a streaming movie box that had kodi pre loaded even though the box wa capable of speed up to mbps it seemed to always buffer or just stop we bought the amazon fire because it support up to mbps and support k a well i rarely have any issue now also the number of apps this will run is great
one of the best streaming device out and at a affordable price
most of the time i use the tablet for the web reading and email but when i want to work on a word doc pdf budget and a lot more i can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop the screen is not a sharp a the is model but is nice enough and it doe not lack anything else
i learn more and more every day what this product can do
have been using the black and white kindle reader for several yearsand the upgrade to the fire ha been a major surprise it ha everything i uld want and in gorgeous lor it is basically a mputer and is moderately easy to learn to use
good e reader overall i bought it for my husband and he like it i have not heard any mplaints
the integration to my home automation is transparent i hope device offered a way skill to connect to all system so i uld have running amazon google apple microsoft at the same between them amazon per what i researched wa the best at my time of purchase and it really make it simple it delivers on what they promise
trying to read a book on my ipad is next to impossible the kindle paperwhite is very easy to read outdoors even in bright sunshine
we use this all the time it is great for information and music
nice little tablet functional and easy to use fit the need that i need to use it for
it is great and always getting better i have three now i listen to audiobooks nstantly and use the white noise option while i sleep
i used a uple of the brand that are just priced under this product and well you get what you pay for this tablet wa much easier for my granddaughter to learn on she can access her camera picture video and game much better than the other brand
although not a preferable a the gaming edition that we already owned this model is also very nice if you are looking to run kodi along with whatever build you may choose ex wookie a free build info found on youtube or beausbuild a paid build info found on fb or local to okc we are running both one on this model and one on the gaming edition currently amazon show the gaming edition unavailable but we have been on a mad hunt for one more because it is faster and me with a game ntroller making operation much easier i would love for best buy to track down any remaining gaming unit and make them available but overall this unit is an excellent choice and will run very smoothly with plenty of room for other application
i love all the thing alexa can do it is very useful i put event on my calendar listen to music have alexa wake me up she cannotell rny joke and answer many question and do so much more
this is a fully functional tablet allowing you to read with mfort and in full sun i thoroughly enjoy it
we bought alexa for father is day my husband is so attach to this robot and we are too
great system give great television alternative for people of all kind
wanted one that played bejeweled blitz this one doe not
the amazon fire is an affordable alternative to some other tablet on the market a great value i like the fact that it is memory is expandable
fire tv ha great feature and if one of the best box being sold
the amazon echo ha been extremely helpful with putting together ad hoc grocery list or list for to do is around the house admittedly i am in the process of learning all the bell and whistle but it ha already been super helpful great product would remmend for anyone
best bang for the buck although it may lack the processing power of the ipad mini it ha all the feature and is of the st at the battery last at least hour of intense gameplay and video watching i bought this primarily for my wife a a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email etc she wa not android savvy but picked this up in a few day i wa very pleased to find it had bluetooth the built in speaker is what you would expect small mono and tinny although it is not listed hd at inch an sd picture is razor sharp lors are bright and the unit is light although you cannot without a hack google it wink wink get google play apps the amazon underground ha k free apps you can also upgrade to gb of external storage wongive it five star a the sound without external speaker or headphone is weak and the speaker is placed on the back but would say star
did every thing we expected i think it is like having someone to help you it ha the weather for any city i need it for play the music i want to hear
pretty basic tablet that suit me since im not really looking for something to do with it other than play or browse the internet
the voyage is easily the best kindle avaiailable the page turn button are a little wonky a time but i find the high re screen worth it
this product work great a a little helper and a a great speaker for music i purchased this for my mother in a nursing home she love it it is very easy to set up and use
they are the best choice for everybody in the family i bought for my family and they truly live it and it wa a great supper dooper deal
this product is a perfect learning tool for my daughter
bought this for my kid new tv it is very easy for them to use
i m not very electronic savvy but with a little help alexa is helpful funny fun and smart
the sound is good and it get really loud new feature are always added and it is mpatible with a growing list of product the le awesome part i have found that if i go to max volume alexa cannot hear me even if i scream right next to her
it is a great tablet for beginner it is not ran off gb so my teen have to have wifi no bill
nice tablet for child work well a a gift for the price
no need to purchase a smart tv with this device wish it came with an hdmi but i pulled one off the unused x box system i also purchased some velcro from a craft store to mount it to the back of the tv it is very light so no need to buy any kind in mounting kit for it
we have waited for the perfect android tablet for our twin grand daughter and we finally found it these are great for game play surfing learning and growing with them the display is amazing easy personalization out of the box and it is through the play store awesome
easy for my kid to use and navigate through fun for adult too
i got the echo for my elderly dad who ha poor vision and ha difficulty using his mputer it is great now he can ask alexa whatever he want to know we have an issue with his wifi though he ha dsl through frontier and it is poor at time so sometimes alexa doe not work you know she didnhear you because she ha a blue light when she hears her name dad is not patient so we ll see if he still enjoys alexa if she is not entirely dependable
i have owned several kindles over the year and this one is the best yet the ntrast and clarity is improved over the already good paperwhite i like the page turn button on the bezel a well
love the screen great price and keep my son entertained he enjoys his short video and picture
my girl love asking alexa to play specific song they want to listen too they also enjoy seeing how smart she is by asking her to figure out homework question
great purchase for the money i really just use it for facebook and game
easy to use many different feature make it fun to use
this tablet work great and my daughter love it only reason not star is because you cant access google play without rooting the tablet way to ruin android amazon
absolutely love this product best decision we have made for entertainment
when looking at kindles i wa debating between the paperwhite and the regular kindle that wa a bit cheaper so happy i spent the extra money for the paperwhite having the backlit screen ha been such a life savor and great feature i loved it while camping and is also nice when reading in bed because you do not need to have a light on waking up the other person i absolutely love this version and remmend it
all the capability of kindle and easy on the eye
fire tv is an awesome tool easy to use and designed to be quick light and filled with option
make an old tv new again wonderful if you are a prime member
we are having a great time with it and very helpful to turn light on a i am ming home so the house ha light on when i me in

i bought this tablet for my son so he uld have something to entertain him on our road trip it work great i love the child proof case that it me with my only mplaint is that the interface is slow sometimes i m honestly not surprised though because it run off of android i typically avoid android but i figured i would give it a shot after using this tablet i think i will avoid using android product again besides the slowness of the android o it is still a great tablet
having a new kindle is always nice but not much is improved
fast functional easy interface small great ntrol kodi mobdro amazon what more can i say
i also have a nook but a ton of glare i can read my kindle paper white anywhere love it
love this product it is nice looking easy to carry and the sound is amazing very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo nothing to mplain about th he speaker itself however the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also one ha to take it down just in order to charge
the product is relatively inexpensive but the performance uld be better
and kodi load fine no issue had to upgrade netflix to k
this is a good one easy to read and browsethis is a good one easy to read and browse
pro a must for amazon prime subscriber lot of medium ntent for playstation vue subscriber it is speedy and fast work great noticeably faster than st generation amazon fire stick high quality feel of the remote ntrol smartphone app work great alexa enabled n vudu app is not supported by amazon not mpatible with generic universal remote unless you buy logitech harmony remote tip price can easily fluctuate from
for the price is the go to android tablet and for a kid is the best first time tablet for sure

this is a great tablet at a great price it is very user friendly
this wa really easy to set up and it work perfectly the speaker sound great for it size i wish it had some bass

i like the size and it is user friendly i originally bought a tablet that wa bigger but it stopped working le than a year and the size wa too big and too heavy for my year old i would definitely remmend it to friend and family
i like my echo but it is taking time to get used to it and enable apps for what i want it to do it getting better but there is a learning curve
so much better than reading on an ipad mpletely worth it i guess my only mplaint is the operating system still seems a little weak in term of responsiveness and fluidity but doe not really impact regular usage of just page turning only felt while browsing the library store etc
bought one for myself then one for our yr old granddaughter who is teaching me how to use it
this is my send kindle i bought the original kindle when it came out and loved it i upgraded to this newer version only because i dropped my old one and damaged the charger port i m extremely happy with the new version and use it daily

wa looking for a tablet for my young daughter this wa on sale and had good review after nsulting with the sale associate with some question i decided to purchase item nice looking product however very little storage space after downloading a few apps the storage wa full and wa required to buy more also cannot play video unless hooked up to wifi unlike the sale associate told me very disappointing would not remmend
this is my send amazon fire tv product first i had the fire tv stick which wa great but a little under power so i went ahead and upgraded to the fire tv box and i have to say that this box is great the streaming picture is gorgeous i am using it hard wired so i cannot talk about the wifi but the video load basically instantly and it never look pixelated i installed kodi and it work great alexa is very handy and can even do shopping list for you the only thing that i do not like is that the search feature on the box it only give you result from the amazon video store it doe not give you result from netflix hulu or others it ha a microsd card slot which is very handy if you are planning to download a lot of game the remote work great and me with battery overall is a great box and if you have an amazon prime subscription is definitely a must you wonfind a better and more organized amazon instant video app
i have enjoyed having the ability to watch almost any movie that i would like to see this even includes movie that are being shown in the theater at that time occasionally we have hit some streaming that tends to pause the show but mostly we can find a go around by choosing another streaming
i d remmend this highlygreat buy for the pricegood graphic and easy to use
very easy installation and work great i d highly remmend it
amazon updated their fire tv box and this is a good option if you want a k upscale tv box
great can charge kindle e book reader without the need of mputer being on
goal get an e reader that allows one to read in any light situation goal achieved reading on the patio beach is great easy to download book lightweight good battery life are all plus
originally purchased to practice rooting android device started using it and determined that i liked it so much i did not root it it is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to amazon everything book music mp all are available through amazon underground not a many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offering notice by design the tablet downloads and store all file to an sd card if one is inserted solidly built it will withstand child is play the resolution is not super high but is very good for it size i read using this tablet and the text is very clear in fact i use text readability a the test for evaluating a tablet resolution after start up you can go through simple process to connect this device with your amazon acunt this to allow purchase on the tablet the parental ntrols are top notch you can limit or allow a little or a much website connection limit purchase also you can also load google play on this tablet with a little searching and downloading of file you can download and play all google play store apps battery life is good speaker is good single speaker only blue tooth connection easy note if you have sync microsoft installed in your vehicle the tablet will connect but ha trouble rennecting it is microsoft what can you expect you will have to unpair delete from sync then rennect to get it to work in your vehicle i use this a my beater tablet for use outside a i do yard work play music while in the shower steamy environment and when running around town it ha gb sd card expansionfor the money get more than one i have total and have given away several more a gift

i have the old kindle that is similar to this but wa alot more for the price this is a steal i will buy a uple more for gift the only real mplaint is the speaker is a little weak so invest in headphone or a plug in speaker
if you enjoy music do not buy you cannot send a bluetooth signal out to an external speaker she is not a smart a siri and answer basic basic question i deal with it because i bought the wemo fixture for light and switch and she work fine with those i would remmend the echo dot if you would like to make her louder or like music loud
this amazon fire is perfect for what i need nice screen and memory size really nice apps preinstalled and it is just ready to use the black friday price wa beyond wonderful
this tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the child
alexa is great looking forward to getting a dot for other room and other device for her still getting to know her but glad she is here
i like the functionality of the echo and how easy it is to use the major downfall for me is not being able to synchronize with apple calendar a it only allows for google calendar to sync i also like that i cannotell alexa to add thing to my shopping list or play different kind of music overall is a god purchase

your mileage may vary but i picked up both the google home and the amazon echo because i wanted to see which one wa best oddly amazon echo pair better with my work acunts gsuite google apps for biz because google home doe not do that yet for home automation echo cannot be beat for playing podcasts echo is on top of it for answering question google home allows me to get to my answer a lot faster with better source in term of audio quality echo is top dog can it hear you from across the room yeah in fact mine can hear me from outside my office room away ha it changed my routine yep i love the flash briefing the skill for now are mostly useless or add ons to the flash briefing it can read your audio book and kindle book and they do a freebie monthly but a i listen at x speed to most of my audio book it is not the most helpful thing ever because there is no speed ntrol yet is it the mputer from the enterprise not yet it cannot perform mplex task like alexa find me a or star chinese restaurant nearby and make a reservation cannot call out hey skype where are you and cannot send text message or write email there is some connecting the dot that will have to happen for this to be life changing but for now it is pretty good

sweet product beat older one by a mile i checked out others but this wa the best all around e reader hand down i read at all time very easy to read at night time with little light easy too get what ever you want to read
the amazon tablet series ha me along way since it first came out the screen on the fire hd is stunning clear and easy to read if used to android apps though may be disappointed that some of your favorite apps will not be available on this tablet
since the most recent update we really like the fire tv we like that the fire tv includes an alexa remote since we have our light connected to our dot before watching a film we can dim the light using the remote the interface of the fire tv obviously emphasizes prime video so it may be useless for those non prime user however fire tv ha a lot of apps that you can use i wa disappointed that vudu wa not on fire tv though
great little tablet i gave a a gift to my mom she is not tech savvy at all and she seems to have no real issue using it
good inexpensive device still in touch with modern technology
love this product i use it everyday to listen to my music ask alexa what time it is and how is the weather some of the thing it doe not pick up such a some of the restaurant or place that i m looking i wa not really happy about that but i m hoping there is a software upgrade or something that will fix it thats the only reason i m giving four star rating

this wa on such a good deal that i uld not resist it i purchased two of these for my and year old child they do not need anything grand but this is more than suitable for them to learn play and enjoy some technology it performs well and i hope it ntinues to last

make life easier i have several smart home product including nest device and hue light alexa let me ntrol them all with my voice and i do not even have to shout even if across the room
there is a lot of bang for you buck in this product it is not up to par with apple pad and the high end samsung pad check out the amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available the screen is adequate not hd and outside full sun hard to read the operating system is amazon is version of android audio is adequate wifi and bluetooth work well
great tablet setup wa easy and it seem to charge quickly

this fire hd is my first such device i find it to be easy to operate and very responsive the touch screen ntrol take getting used to a i often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back the alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker i shut her off since i m not a fan of nversing with mputers my main mplaint is that me with nothing but a charger and cable the wordless pictorialstart up instruction were primitive and vague there are no instruction on how to use thisdevice no sample book to test and get familiar with there is a help function thatfills in some basic of functionality but not thorough enough the wifi connectivity is great using the latest protol and encryption it ha a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery the cable can be used toattach to a window pc and transfer file book music picture etc i would also remmend buying a protective case for if it ever accidently dropped

amazon echo doe so much and fun to use i would definitely remmend this item
i mainly use this tablet to read my kindle book on but it also handle playing music and watching video fine great for social medium a well a perfect first tablet for someone who ha yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology definitely buy a decent sized micro sd card when you get it though a the real space you receive after purchase is more like gb because the o take so much space on the device
i already have kindle hdx love it so i got this cheaper one for my son he u it to watch movie etc work great

the amazon echo is a great device that ntinues to evolve not perfect yet but the fact that it ntinues to get better with new skill is enuraging setting it up and connecting to my other smart device wa easy and ha worked seamlessly ever since

we bought the fire a an easy way for our year old mother to see picture of the family from all over the untry it wa very simple to set up and learn to use she play game on it a well
never realized how useful the echo is until you start using it setting alarm timer weather traffic music you name it
i had a kindle earlier and rarely used it because the interface did not feel reading friendly this one is better i am using it for two textbook and find the interface improved the purchase came with a free month of amazon prime which wa a plus even though i decided not to renew after the month wa over
wanted to buy a reliable and st effective tablet wa afraid the screen might be too small dad loved it he is and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the internet use skype and listen to music he is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card
ha what is necessary for the average individual need
easy to load work with our local library borrow book for free
this kindle ha a decent screen and image quality the feature i miss most is the lack of capability of this tablet to automatically shut down when you close the case but understandable at the price point
uld never get into reading from a tablet like the ipad or even the amazon kindle fire it just didnfeel right this device make it feel a if you re reading actual paper print it is amazing i highly remmend it if your an avid reader
i received an email asking if i would like to give my review and i am glad that i did i purchased this le than month ago and it ha already quit working it will not charge and it will no longer power on all i have is a black screen when it did work it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several time during use i would not remmend this product

we now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share i would have no problem remmending this to a friend
alexa is a great enhancement to any home automation system you need to do some research in order to find out all you can do with it but this is part of the fun i can only remmend this to any tech geek

i bring it with me every where i read my book on it surf the web and play my favorite game on it
i really wanted to give this device a chance but i did end up returning it it is a huge upgrade though over the cheaper version honestly i do not think anyone should purchase that if your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the amazon esystem i e prime member this will make a great tablet i think it is intended more for kid though than adult having ipads in the house we tried this with our toddler a a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirk of the amazon o just were not worth the hassle will end up seeking out a used ipad mini instead of this
got this linked to my logitech harmony hub and smartthings hub now i can just say alexa turn on off tv and it work

owned roku for year bought fire tv to root to watch free tv and movie only a few apps v roku roku user friendly more apps fire tv free movie free rerded tv
run much better than the fire stick especially for some apps such a playstation vue the fire stick is more nvenient and take le room but is not a powerful if you are buying the product for playstation due then you will be returning the fire stick to buy this one

i love my echo you can ask it most everything and get an answer play music with great sound
easy to install and use the only cable not cut is internet
i love how light and nvenient it is to carry around this is beyond worth it for an avid ebook purchaser i signed up to prime for my son and none of the chapter book that he really wanted were ever available not an issue with the kindle just ntent that would be relevant for subscription ie kid magazine are not necessarily available on the paperwhite just remember it is not a tablet which is lovely if you only want some good uninterrupted reading
i liked it a lot for my four year old and it is kid proof
good price work well best buy sale associate wa very helpful in selecting this product
size make tablet easy to take with but still large enough to be easy to see
outclasses other tablet at this price point only downside is the need to use the amazon app store instead of the normal google play store great tablet for the kid though
i like everything about the voyage reader it ha a crisp display is small and lightweight i give it four star instead of five because the screen light take sometimes a while to adjust the battery life is amazing prize uld be a little le

great item for someone looking to cut the rd the selection are endless
i bought an echo tap and dot doing it over again i would buy tap sound from the echo is slightly better than the tap but i love the portability of the tap at le cant go wrong with either echo or tap
hopefully this will at least work a an e reader otherwise amazon ha it locked up so tight one cannot do much else with it and even with my fiber optic wi fi it is slower than ld molasses in january in canada well i needed a kindle e reader and for that is ok
hold charge well portable lightweight and a best we cannotell nearly indestructible perfect for kid
so far we like this we have not really had a lot of luck with linking to both of our phone i really like the grocery shopping and to do list feature very helpful i m sure there is a lot more it will do that we will figure out in time

traveling in ach is horrible so i wa looking for a small light weight dedicated device that allowed me to focus on reading this product is perfection i have read several book on various iphones including my over the year but they re nothing like the paper white display
much faster then the tradional fire stick i highly remmend it over the fire stick
i really like the tablet it wa easy to set up everything on it the only mplaint is that it is a bit slow i love that i can add storage to it when needed
took product back and wa told that in order to get assistance the geek squad would have to help me at my home and be charged for the service i decided we didnneed the product that badly so took it back for a refund
i have plenty of firesticks this is an upgrade let me stream faster because it ha a faster processor family love it it knock down the cable bill
this tablet is excellent when you are an on the go person you not only have the ability to access the internet but you have the ability to read a good book a well you will not have to lug a big book with you if youre out and about i have never had a tablet where book can be downloaded onto it and it free i am one satisfied customer
work great in my kitchen so helpful with task
excellent product excellent product excellent product a a a
i got this to play game and to be on facebook love it
fast and easy to use perfect for playstation vue and plex clear picture quick and intuitive interface
picked this up on black friday for about it work great for another tablet sitting in the living room for a quick internet search and apps to ntrol tv and sonos
a wonderfully designed device but it use is fairly limited i bought it primarily to use a a smart home ntrol device however although it allows you to turn on and off light you cannot add timer to the ntrol instruction for instance you cannot tell the echo to turn off a light in minute you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately finding that out wa incredible disappointing i do not know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature
great addition to the tv quick plug and play and very easy to use
gave this tablet to a friend a a xmas gift and they love it easy to use and the size is perfect
i wa a bit worried that i would not like the tablet i had watched the price go up and down on amazon i wish i had bought one when they were i also read all of the review and watched video review i had a trip ming up that i didnwant to take my laptop on and took the plunge i wa glad that i did i wa able to watch netflix hulu hbo go hbo now and youtube with no problem it is a great tablet for the price i also have some book loaded to read later i have been using my kindle touch for that if you do buy this tablet i would suggest getting a memory card
he love it i love it it wa the perfect birthday gift for him he ha lot of game to play and it perfect for my reading
the amazon echo is a mbination fun entertaining and helpful electronic product best buy offered the echo at a great price and reasonable shipping rate my next buy will be the mini version from the same store
i got it when my mputer broke will get a laptop later
size is a little small and hard to type because character are close together charge rd is positional so it is difficult to play with it while charging and rd is very short the price is very good and it work well i like the amazon store and added benefit of amazon in
love the safety feature for parent to protect their little one from some ntent on the internet love preloaded program
i love this product and that you cannotake alexa everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker you can connect it to your phone when away from a wifi building the speaker is great it is surrounded by cloth which i would worry about it getting dirty the one downside to the tap mpared to the echo dot or the og echo is that alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the tap you have to press the speaker button pretty self explanatory name you have to tap the tap i ended up returning it to get the dot but like i said great speaker great portable device
this is the send kindle i have purchased and i love my kindle what i do not like is that every time a device is upgraded the upgrade are annoying on this kindle the home page is changed it list my reading list and my library so you have to press my library to choose a new book then it is a list of the book why uld not they just leave the home page showing the small picture of the book you bought i have no idea what my reading list is it list book i have never heard of by author and topic of which i have no interest still i would remmend a kindle to anyone who read book the screen is easy to read you can make the font bigger or smaller i do not feel the battery last any longer than my old one did but it is easy to charge it is thin and lightweight and i pretty much carry my kindle wherever i go anyone who buy a kindle will definitely not be disappointed
bought this for my daughter tablet work amazing only thing i didnt like wa that you are required to place a cc on file with amazon in order to use it i would say if you are looking for a tablet stick to the samsung galaxy model v others
nice for all the basic would have been nice to be able to download a mp music downloader
overall this seems to be a good tablet but i wish it used the google play store a well a the amazon apps because i cannot get the target cartwheel without paying
i really like this tablet but i wa amazed by the weight of it mpared to my wife is kindle tablet the version is quite a bit heavier which make it a bear to hold for long period other than that it is great
this device is good for people trying to reduce their cable bill
great product great price great service cannot asked for anything better
the entire family enjoys this product provides music weather timer and viirtually anything you need to know great product
this echo is an addition to others we have in home we are currently trying to get one out in every room the sound quality is right there with any nose system
alexa is good for basic need weather timer streaming but lack the ability for proper search ability like google also the ability to stream book need work
my son ha the vacuuming chore he love his new toy it is light and seems to walk itself
easy setup loaded with many service ntent provider some are fee based some provide free ntent you choose which one to view from i only use the free one i would say that the quality of the streaming program definitely depends on the quality speed of your internet connection so negotiate the best deal you can get for the fastest service you can afford btw search the net to learn how to set this up with apps that allow you to stream stuff you never thought uld be free enjoy
it very easy to set up and use love to take it with me screen it large enough to read easy on it

use the kindle apps on android phone and tablet but apps do not support family sharing these kindles are great and inexpensive for that purpose
great tablet great price nice clarity would remmend to others
ok so it is super ol being able to just talk to something that is right there in the kitchen and ask question set a timer check the news or even listen to music you just have to get over the freak out of who else might be able to listen in if hacker find a way
love the feel of it and love the page turn buttton

it work good but have not used it that much would remmend
at the price of you cannot go wrong great mobile device that is bigger than trying to use phone
stopped working after only a year felt flimsy did like that i uld upload amazon book
most tablet in this price range have the quality to show for it that is not the case with this unit while only it feel more sturdy and act more responsive and capable than other bargain tablet that fit into the same price range the amazon app store ha a lot of great option and the popular apps you would expect from apple or google app store the only downside is the navigation even then it is only a personal problem a i am used to google play all in all this is a great tablet at an even greater price
i love all of my amazon product including my latest purchase the amazon fire box i have the stick o two tv is and now the box on my new k tv along with my prime acunt i am in heaven

good for streaming off internet no buffering on lodi and live tv
this tablet is a good kid tablet and or for prime user not a laptop replacement or for non amazon user
there is a good amount of value in this device particularly if you nsume ntent from amazon i bought this tablet for my daughter but her primary source of ntent is youtube and there is a dearth of quality youtube apps on the amazon app store she mostly u an old iphone for this purpose when at home on the road however i am sure she will use the fire tablet with movie and prime ntent loaded up on the microsd card it is a solid device i have not enuntered any glitch freeze or app crash but it is not used a much a our other device i would remmend it if you nsume prime ntent or you are clumsy with electronics pro good value almost disposable microsd slot underground multi user support easy access to prime ntentns amazon is fire ui amazon is app store no support for google apps such a youtube gmail etc battery life uld be better no stock ntent producing apps like imovie garageband etc

bought this a an anniversary gift for my husband so far he love it our son ha an echo and hubby really like it now to add accessory
love alexa she is very helpful and wa very easy to set up she learns new skill everyday
my previous tablet have been android so i do not care for the navigation on the home page it ha take some getting used to however it is nice to have an actual kindle when i read my book a opposed to just the app
it is affordable and it had increased storage but no backlight and the screen uld be better
wa a bit difficult to initially set up ease in operation would be great the tablet doe not hold battery well at all it seems that maybe and hour or two go by before time to re up on battery life

i love it because it give me access to all my favorite show
great tablet for reading and playing game graphic are great
my wife love this kindle the only mplaint is the charging port ha been a problem we ended up exchanging it for a new one after a week or so because the port wa loose and it wa very hard to charge it the send one ha been much better but there ha been a uple of time the charging port ha given u issue
this is my third kindle they just keep getting better
i bought this to turn the light on in the bedroom when i have to get up during the night also work good for keeping shopping list and listening to music
i am really impressed with amazon box the processor is really fast and responsive ha one of the better remote out there
gift for mom didnknow if she would use it seems to be useful and make it easy for her to listen to music also help with weather joke tend to be rny ha not used it to order anything got one for other family member and they seem to use it too
very stable system pretty much identical to fire stick only pay more money to stream limited k ntent
my primary reason for purchasing this wa to ntrol my new smart home device in particular our phillips hue light work great for off on and dimming at a percentage but cannot get the lors and scene to work ha to be so exact with the naming of the light and wording when you speak to alexa also making list is just a shopping list it would be great if i uld add to an amazon wish list instead seems like a natural great for checking weather sport and such playing music is hit or miss with my prime acunt to really get everything you apparently have to have the monthly fee enabled unlimited feature example i can listen to the police or foo fighter but no led zeppelin really then it just try to sell you the upgrade when you ask it to play something it cannot that is pretty annoying looking forward to apple is version of this more expensive and still many month away but since i have an apple music acunt and it will play my playlist the alex echo wa a great price though and a good starting home hub speaker
this is a great product at a great price i would definitely remmend this to anybody especially good for llege student or people that read book etc
amazon echo black is a powerful and versatile product bestbuy had the best price available for this product at the time of my purchase
my mother in law wa so happy to get this tablet she cried when she opened our gift at christmas it is easy to use and easy to navigate she is a first time tablet user at almost year old and ha never used a smartphone either she now spends most of her time on it great tablet for the price definitely remmend
love the kindle product have purchased several kindles and several type and this is another great product this model doesnt have the auto dimming feature that i like on previous model but still a great kindle
perfect all around reader great price and service
this thing is awesome connected my spotify and cannotell alexa to play anything i want i mainly use it for music i use the timer feature all the time when i m oking and listen some news and weather most morning it is worth every penny great product
very similar to the fire stick but it seems a bit faster when downloading
this tablet is by far one of the best purchase we have made for my son the kid feature is extra nice
got this for my wife is birthday she had an older model and wanted an upgrade she seems very happy with it and u it every day
ideal for reading book just like a hard ver book
this box is work great all the apps work and are responsive with little to no lag for buck it is a great deal i barely watch cable anymore because you can access tv show on every network from the most recent to the first episode i use this every single night since buying it and have had no problem with it at all
i would definitely remmend it is great for every day use
i love reading book this way this is my rd kindle my first wa the one with the keyboard then i got a kindle hd i wanted to be able to read outdoors so i bought the paperwhite i love it
have enjoyed this kindle especially for the price
three star due to the fact that sometimes the fire tv remote doe not work i will then use my smart tv remote other than that issue i would give five star
great little tablet after you add google play store take some research to do
this tablet is the best you can buy for the money great apps great picture
my son love this tablet he can read book and play game on one device
the amazon fire tablet doe everything that i need it to do and for the fraction of the price of other tablet on the market screen size and weight are both great
one of the best purchase or investment you uld make for technology
bought this a a gift for my aunt and she love it easy to get connected and set up she is totally non techny and wa able to do it herself great buy
worked great the first week then started to reset randomly finally had to hard reset it work fine now maybe had an update i use it for my morning alarm and play music at night
my granddaughter love this fire for al her game we also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this so many thing she will learn how to do on this tablet
i use alexia every day to turn on light zwave and change channel on my tv logitech harmony hub i have a few dot around the house too
if you do not have an echo or never played with one you will be in for a treat word cannot describe how much i love this thing it ntrols home automated device find information such a recipe can do shopping for you find review on product play music tell joke and so much more i want one for every room now it will do phone call and voice texting to people who have alexa device the phone call on my weak internet wa flawless
purchased a a gift to my wife she love the tablet easy blue tooth attachment to sound bar good solid nstruction great for so many u paying bill balancing check book writing and reading nice mpact size replace bulky home mputer and laptop so many u
amazon fire tv i use it a lot it is worth the price it st
work well for me do not need cable tv can stream all my program with fire tv
like then light easy to read outside just easier to read overall
alexa doe a great job playing music and adding item to my shopping list i have not used very many of the skill but i think this item ha great potential to ntinue to improve
bought this device to stream netflix amazon prime and to play downloaded ntent for that purpose it is sufficient i would not use a fire tablet a a productivity device a it is seriously underpowered fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when i attempted to multi task bottomline this is not an ipad replacement particularly if you like to do a variety of thing on your tablet but at on sale this wa a very good deal for my purpose
i bought it for my grandson for christmas and so far it ha been good it is him that is the problem he is not able to understand some of the stuff but will in time
i purchased one for myself and my mom to use for the word game book to help enhanse her mind
first the good news the screen is a nice brightness and the word are crisp and clear best of all it is so light and tiny esp in the origami case that it is super easy to carry around in a purse love that also it ha an amazing battery life i have never had it run out on me and i do not even have to recharge it all the time i thought this would be perfect but i am having two problem turning page is not a easy or pleasant a my much older now defunct kindle if i do not touch the screen in the right place the page wonturn and it usually ha an annoying split send black flash on the screen the ancient kindle wa easier about half the time when i return to reading the screen is frozen on the ad it say swipe to open but no amount of swiping get it going i have to reach to the rear of the kindle which mean disassembling the crimp in the origami to press the button on the back to get it to function again there is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it is about half the time perhaps i am doing something wrong regarding both flaw but there is no one to ask about it best buy staff doe not know
my husband really wanted an echo after using it at our son is house i did not realize how much we would use it i know we do not use all of the feature my favorite is the shopping list the quick access to it on my phone little thing help a lot
user friendly and overall great product camera quality is not the greatest but this is not intended to be used a a camera so i cannot mplain
i really like the sound of the tab the only mplaint is that you have to push the button every time you have to speak or listen to tab unlike the echo where you just speak and it answer without pushing any button the echo ha a cheaper sounding speaker i d wait till there is a sale in it before paying full price otherwise it is just like a bluetooth speaker
this is my th kindle fire when we go on road trip each of the kid in the back of van are occupied watching movie playing game or reading book on the kindle
i love the kindle fire i have an i pad but i love to read on my kindle the size is great i like to read at night so my kindle make it much easier my grandson also play game on it it is a great product
purchased for viewing amazon prime loaded a uple apps and set it to sleep when i returned a few hour later it wa stuck in a perpetual boot and wa not reverable i will get another a i like the feature and price point just a little soured by this first impression i m checking that i would not remmend to a friend but am hoping this will change with the send one to be ntinued
i can say that amazon fire tv is a great product for people who enjoy watching their favorite show in a easy way with out too much work do not think about it too much just buy it
my son enjoys to play with his tablet but definitely you gotta take a little time to set it up for them to be safe while they are playing with
i bought for the wife she is still using her old one do not know why
great gift for a young teen tereat price terrific
easy to setup customizable and affordable android box highly remmended for your android need
i tried giving this a chance being that i m an amazon prime member but in mparison to my th generation apple tv it fall way short i really just wish amazon would develop the app for tvos
good product
love this kindle paperwhite it is easily carried in my purse
this tablet ha all i need to enjoy using it i bought it for the low price otherwise i may have waited to buy
work great nice picture pretty fast only downfall is that you cannot access the google play store which i needed due to some specific apps that is the only reason for not star i will still keep it though great for the price
very thin and portable if i have read more i would use it
got it for my wife she love it easy to read love the fact that doe not have to carry a book with her
this tablet is great and easy to use very nvenient and handy to have around
fire tv work great and user friendly great for watching movie
picked this up on the black friday ad and it is one of the best reader i have in the house i have got nook ipad and android device which do not operate a good a this reader but it only serf that purpose in my house
so much fun and can do ton of thing great to ask question and get info can even ntrol temperature in the home a well a light with added product
buying this device i thought it uld replace my phone which my kid love to use to watch their video it is great with application but it is limited when it me to kid video outside of amazon is store
keep finding more this to do with it music is great and i like the shopping list
set up wa easy and load time and picture quality is amazing the only set back is you have to purchase pretty much anything i understand buying a movie but to have to buy tv episode is a draw back i uld just stick with my direct tv for that
me and my wife used the fire stick to stream show for over a year and recently upgraded our internet to a higher speed package to take advantage of the new speed i thought i d get the fire tv to use the ethernet port on the back not only doe it stream the show much faster and hd work much better now but just clicking through the menu is so much nicer with no hesitation if you are on the fence go with the fire tv and save yourself the upgrade later definitely worth it
bought this tablet for my daughter so far so good
it is a handy little tool to have for reading e book
my wife is enjoying her new tablet because she is able to receive free book through her kindle acunt
purchased this a an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite the backlight is greatly improved the display is of a higher quality the word are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker â â opening book and page flipping is noticeably speedier the one thing that doe annoy me about the rd generation paperwhite is the way it is manufactured â when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen you can see a small section of the display vered in the e ink used to render the word and image on the rest of the screen at first i thought this wa a manufacturing defect so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model only to find that the send model had the same issue except more visible this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process when the paperwhite first came out it wa the crown jewel of amazon is e reader line and amazon wa careful to precision craft the device now that honor fall to the more expensive voyage with the paperwhite beming the flagship but still cheaper option in the kindle lineup meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced mpared to that of the voyage this wonbe a huge annoyance for some people it is for me and it is seriously made me nsider whether it is worth contacting amazon over for everyone else though this is a great e reader and well worth the money if you re looking for an e reader this is the one to buy
i have put off buying a tablet because all the ipads i tried with friend were hypersensitive making it difficult for me to navigate easily this one is the bomb i am and not a techie but quite intelligent this kindle fire is a perfect fit for me and doe everything i want it to do and more with great speed and wonderful resolution i am new at tablet and look forward to enjoying learning all that this kindle fire will provide for me so far each step ha been a breeze i just love it
sound is crisp alexa is always on point we love it
for me this tablet is an extremely good value ipads are beautiful thing and they seem to just work really well all the time but they are expensive same thing with android tablet you can get a cheap android tablet but then you re left with a cheap tablet poor quality display questionable hardware limited support i think amazon hit the spot with their line of fire tablet this hd in particular it is good quality ha a great display it is quick and snappy ha great battery life also being an android based operating system there is flexibility like accessing storage side loading third party apps even installing google play for those who begrudge the lack of that feature it can be done much more flexibility than you get with an apple product at a much lower price than the industry standard samsung etc ming from using apple product for so long this thing is really nvincing me that there are really viable option other than apple and especially for the price it a great introduction to a different platform not only that it is genuinely a good product
hand down the best ereader available i researched several device and it came down to the paperwhite and the voyage there is a pretty hefty price premium for the voyage most people will probably be very satisfied with the paperwhite i typically need reading glass to read regular size print on an ereader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so i do not need to use the glass that mean le text on each page and many more page turn the physical button hep make the page turn easier and extra light brightness help to add ntrast to the text these were enough to sell me on the voyage it wa the right decision and i love the device
cute speaker a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capability make it worth it
i have waited to purchase a tablet when the kindle fire came on sale i decided to take advantage of the sale price so far this ha been a very good purchase for what i intend to use the tablet for e mail facebook news and book to read easy to use and have enjoyed this product
i really love my amazon echo it respond to voice really well it is nstantly updating and getting better with more and more feature it can play music tell joke ntrol light etc it is pretty awesome
it light weight i do not care for the amazon app store android is so much better i cannot get all the app i need from amazon the amazon kindle is a nice size and light weight
i like how i can u my echo for everything it is one of the best thing i brought
this is so worth it if you are tired of cable just can watch just about everything
it good to have along with cable hopefully you get one a a present and not purchase yourself
this is actually my send one in year due to my boyfriend taking ownership of the first one
work perfect
i u these for kodi and they never let me down hate seeing people pay more for item that do not need it if you interested in difference between fire tv and fire stick the tv is boat load faster than the stick i started with stick and now have tv s
bought it for the price and my mother in law ha one keep freezing up but st good
i bought this tablet a a gift for my granddaughter to play game on it is very easy for her to use and it is just the right size
i purchased this product for my yo for his birthday and it ha been perfect
excellent just a good a ipad with a fraction of the price
no regret with this device the paperwhite from amazon is a cheaper model that is worth looking into if this model is too much i used to read on various io android tablet but wanted to get something that allows me to read ebooks but also have week of battery life on a single charge all those book on such a small and thin device is still amazing to me this and the official amazon case is what i use
nice for music and home automation ntrol used ha bridge to call home genie api uri is
love this tablet everything is excellent for the price except no google play store i am not a fan of subpar apps take amazon is outdated facebook app accept google play and i will rate star
do not pay attention to their ad it say the plug is not included with the kindle and it absolutely is if they lie about this sort of thing what else do you think the lie about steer clear these guy are rip off artist
she understand almost everything she is quickly to respond and you can actually synchronize your fire stick with it a well
my wife love it great picture quality and easy to use
gave this to my year old grandson he love it learned to dl his game and love to play it
very good tablet camera not very good poor resolution
i also have a fire and like it is overall performance
i bought the fire tv for using my sling tv subscription it work great but the only thing i do not like about this product is we cannot install apps from external source i tried to install an external app which worked fine for day and stopped working later giving me message that the app wa not installed from amazon app store
very functional device take some time making alexa smarter unfortunately it need to be powered by a wall adapter so you cannot take it from room to room
luv the tablet and reading the book resolution is great
i wa iffy about choosing between this kindle and the newer one this kindle ha gotten me to read more and i love it that is why i bought it no flaw in it exactly what i wanted
i would remmend this to other grandparent for their grandkids
these tablet are a great value theyre perfect for kid or user who just want to browse the web read etc they are not the most powerful but for the price they re an amazing deal p use a search engine and learn how to sideload android apps the amazon store is a bit limited and missing some popular apps sideloading remove that problem all together
the kindle is so easy to read in all lighting situation the e ink screen is responsive and quick to touch ntrols
tablet met all her need she love it great purchase
i can see many more u for this i like the way it can be improved easily with more functionality added
first i wanna say that the amazon fire series is the best in medium streaming device out now i purchased this do to the fact that i had a best buy reward upon since i racked up a lot of point from previous purchase i wa curious to see if this worked just like the fire stick i am here to say it doe and better i wanted to try out my ethernet connection rj cable and see if it would lag or buffer so far it ha not you can install kodi tv on this just like the fire stick i just installed kodi version and i must say it work faster and the movie are more clearer a well i run it through my home audio receiver with an hdmi passthough which is more efficient for most of the smart tv on the market today the audio is way better i had to go to the setting on kodi and change from a channel to channel it also ha a sd card slot usb drive a well do not know if i will ever need that if you are an amazon prime member is also a good advantage a well because you can also stream any amazon prime video for free good job amazon
this wa a replacement for my son a he had one for about year that just got broken
a far a functionality it work well i can surf the internet match movie check social medium and anything else a tablet is supposed to do the app store ha a good variety off apps it doe not have a many a the itunes store but there is plenty of variety the reason i knock a star off is the nstant ad i know that this is an amazon product but the ad get a little annoying
many people asked why i wa getting an echo when i had siri on my iphone that basically did the same thing first you set the echo up and it is always there in the same spot no more looking for my phone in the morning holding it up to my face and asking about the weather and traffic while i am shaving in the bathroom i call out and ask about the weather and it tell me it how nvenient is that
great tablet i purchased for my nephew
very good deal when i bought it even better pricing than from amazon itself
love it best charger i ever bought quickly charge my kindle and my cell phone
i have all bought all three of my girl kindles and they have all been happy
i have been a kindle owner since the early day and when new version have me out in the past it wa usually a no brainier to upgrade the oasis wa a little challenging because the price really make you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it after a lot of thought the factor that nvinced me to switch wa the reappearance of the page turning button i missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard the paper white and the voyage were great device but i often accidentally changed page if i accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting position on the uch the oasis button have removed that issue and i am delighted the weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already the addition of the ver is interesting but after a month is use i think it is pretty clear the ver battery is there only to boost the very short lived battery in the kindle itself month of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minute a day the screen is clear and bright i cannot see any led issue others have mplained about and the interface doe seem snappier than older version ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn button and want to pay top dollar for them otherwise the existing kindles will meet your need
good for price one should not expect the quality of ipad from this product
great screen fast and responsive touch ntrols and linked to amazon for your apps overall the best tablet you can find for under
the paperwhite wa excellent at first but just yesterday feb le than month since i purchased it it froze and nothing i do will work i am taking it back to best buy and hope they can fix it
great tablet for the price got it for my daughter she love it
i wanted a low st internet device to feed internet radio choice into my stereo this fit the bill well i use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound i do not use most of the other apps that me on the device
this is the best streaming device for anyone you can use any of your streaming acunts netflix hulu kodi you will not be disappointed
love everything about it it is a handy device and is a great speaker
i have an ipad and though i can say this is no ipad it work great especially for the money never touch the ipad any more and even bought some of these for my kid
my phone note is just a little small to hold and to read book on this kindle is much better lightweight easy to read great battery life it is right on the edge of being a little big but that is probably because of what i have been used to
nvenient functional practical device i loved this product
this item is amazing it doe so much and i definitely remmend it
this firestick have made me mpletely independent from cable tv
i ordered this a i had already purchased one for myself and i found that my year old son uld use it quite easily and loved the game on it i also ha purchased the year no question asked insurance i like that i can set time limit when the device can wake and when it can sleep how much time should be spent for educational work v play or movie i like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it sts in case either of my child decide to throw it across the room i have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic device can beme air borne in a moment notice for no reason at all so i am no longer willing to spend hundred of dollar on a tablet also i had purchased a galaxy tab and found that i uld not use amazon apps on the secured profile side unless i installed the app on that side which would give my child access to purchasing apps i wa not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the galaxy tab i also found that my older son wanted the amazon apps from the amazon underground store that my youngest son wa playing when i looked on google play for them those same apps to put on the tab were a piece being they were disney apps well this tablet ha virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my child are happy i have insurance on both so i am not worried about them breaking them i do not have to match apps on another device my child read book and watch movie or play apps so the internet is not really a ncern a it is a little slow but not painful overall i definitely would buy it again and i would remmend it very happy with my purchase a it suit my need
i purchased fire tablet for my kid they love them i should have reserved the prior due to the fact that they are use to the android network so it is taking some getting use to but the work and function just fine no problem yet especially for the price
you can ask alexa almost anything kid love it play all my music
i wa really surprised with this tablet i m glad i made the purchase i am able to do a much and more with it a a tablet i paid much more for i also love the size the mobility make it much easier to carry around better than my laptop great buy
love the ease to use the back light and the size previous kindle died after year wa worried i would not like the change but now i read even more because of the ease of using and light
bought this tablet at my local store the nephew love it
super light the paper white is a huge success and the battery life is a advertised however it is so light and small it mandate a protective case but they are never in stock or otherwise available
good tablet for general use easy to add apps good battery lifetime
love how easy it is to train very nvenient to use
love the echo for everything from music to weather
my girlfriend and i have essentially beme rd cutter so we had to find a box top set so that we uld watch our netflix directtv and hbo we got this because it wa remmended by a friend the user interface is simple and it work great if you have amazon prime the main issue we have is when we forget to put it to sleep which i remmend you do is that the apps stall and do not start up right away i m not sure if it is the apps or the fire tv itself it bothersome at time but it is nothing that we have to get replaced
great price for the amazon tablet it is def worth the money just do not like that you cannot get real version of the google apps
had a kid fire and switched to this with a kid case and tempered glass this time work really well for kid
it is wa on sale on this lor put the play store and made it real android tablet

great product needed something i uld travel with
slower than my last kindle the power button is not easy accesible when in a case
i have been enjoying using my amazon echo it is very satisfying

nephew loved to play game and listen to music he never put it down very good buy
have a fire stick and it is ok but after using this is would not even nsider getting the stick due to the performance of this
now all of my child have a kindle this one is by far the best one
i work in natural speech and language processing so i m quite familiar with the technology behind the echo i purchased my echo to test an alexa skill that i d written while the process of connecting it to wifi is clunky the echo is otherwise quite easy to use i m often impressed at how well the farfield asr doe a regnizing my speech even when i m yelling from another room my wife and i soon found ourselves wanting another one to put downstairs
got this on black friday for buck for my year old for youtube viewing for my year old it is amazing doe the job decent battery it is not that fast or the screen ainthat great but for buck you get what you pay fori think it is great for kid if you need to do serious stuff on tablet and thinking you can get away with it with this tablet definitely do not buy it
i purchased this tablet for a yr old and it is very easy for him to use
great tablet for someone to start out with i have never personally owned a tablet before this but i have used other family member tablet this one feel like it is missing something some of the apps do not work on it i still enjoy it though
the echo is a really fun handy device to have around i always start my day with alexa good morning for a fun fact about the day my wife and i use her in njunction with our philip hue light and nest thermostat which make you really feel like you have a smart home asking question and taking advantage of prime music are a few additional thing we use alexa for on a regular basis overall i think a long a you purchase the echo when it is on sale it is a worthy investment especially if you have other connected device but it is not an essential device that you cannot live without
it is the perfect tablet for a kid to watch cartoon and play game the protection is awesome
this is so great love it and looking forward to ditching my cable mpany
i love hear reader i had to replace mine because i destroyed the last but it is awesome

i really love both amazon tv and apple tv a product i do wish amazon tv ha a simplified airplay ability for io i m sure with apps you buy and other method you can acmplish it but if it wa just standard like apple tv airplay i would give this product star for cheap easy price it make a great gift where it beat apple tv is k streaming so if you want k get amazon fire tv

great way to get rid of cable easy to setup an de use
i saw that best buy had a great deal on this and i wa looking for a smaller sized tablet for all the kindle book i have bought or ordered the item shipped pretty quickly and i did have issue setting it up but once i got through that i fell in love i quickly downloaded my book to the kindle and surfed online with ease this wa a great deal
i have the send generation kindle paperwhite and the new voyage is far superior to it the resolution is much sharper the back light is much brighter and the power button location is much more nvenient i highly remmend it
i had the fire stick before buying this and though i liked the fire stick i thought it uld be faster the fire tv definitely bump up the performance a bit and having the voice search really help a lot and make it better
this tablet is great for trip just make sure you download game and show on it first since it doe not have internet the case is great for kid who are rough with technology it really take a beating
love shopping at best buy better deal than walmart
this is a good alternative to the amazon echo i like that supposedly it is not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to alexa
meet or exceeds all my need simple and fun for game looking forward to reading my first book
if you like the old kindle fire it just like the new one but better better screen and more space
great device i did exchange it for a white one it would work better if i had better internet connection at my house
allows me to decide if i want to stop using tv provider
this product is great for child easy to use and very inexpensive allows for enough storage and very durable
i bought the amazon fire tablet while walking around and saw the price at the time got home and set it up immediately and added the play store app by google a bit tricky the device is nice to hold battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at my kid started using it and after that i uld not even get a turn to play with it it is a great device for the even at regular price of dollar it still is a good purchase my only ncern about it is that i wish it had another gig of ram totalling instead of just gb ram enjoy

a great value for the money you can save instead of a ipad from apple
excellent tablet for my grandkids durable awsome year free replacement if damaged for any reason
i have both amaxon echo and google home i do not find but little between the two
let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot or at least what i would nsider to be a lot which is about decently long book a month up until buying the paperwhite i wa doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app long story short i ended up returning the paperwhite after about week why because i realized just how sporadic my reading wa i read when i m out and about waiting at a doctor is office or in line at a restaurant etc it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best e reader is the one you have with you at all time for me that is my iphone the actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite however if you re an on the go reader like me then it just mean you have to carry around another device dedicated e reader are for people who either truly read a ton or have a set routine for reading if that is not you then stick with your phone
my son liked it it a great tablet for kid i remmend it
bought this a a gift for my mom is birthday she really enjoys it
i love just saying to play a particular album or song from a particular artist or specific music such a jazz
i like the ease of setup and the apps available in fire tv
this is a great tablet without the steep st of an ipad i have not used it too much so far but the picture and sound is pretty good and being able to stream movie show is quite nice
this wa replacement for my wife is original ipad and broken kindle paperwhite she love it a it doe basically everything both of the previous device did in one unit that is easy to use ha good battery life very nice screen resolution and good size for her great value especially mpared to an ipad
it is amazing what it can do for the family a lot of fun
picked this up for a spare tablet and at it wa a no brainer video game book music work great lot of capability screen look great and it doe feel a lot sturdier a it wa a more expensive tablet if you cannot find an app you can install google play store have to search for it online for instruction i did return this tablet a we specifically bought this to be use while on the treadmill and you cannot access bravo or e tv they only make apps for io ipad ipod iphone other than that it not a problem with amazon or their tablet i blame it on bravo excellent tablet otherwise i will definitely buy it again in the future just do not need it at this moment
i bought the original kindle fire table to get a newer one due such a great price is awesome
the clarity of the screen and the back lit text make this an improvement from my old tablet i now can read this in low light and enjoy the lor a well i am enjoying my new kindle but it did present some challenge in it set up i would remmend getting help in the store to get you started
i love my amazon fire i purchased one for my year ol and she u it to view netflix hulu and you tube i shop email surf the net and pay bill with mine i bought an extra and downloaded my fire now i have a fire and a fire my fire my husband u so for back up i have a fire it take nice pic a well the fire will make a very nice gift for someone oh do not forget your free book you can download
this tablet is great for kid and adult who have little to no knowledge of mputers it handle easily and ha plenty of storage
if u have kid or just need a basic tablet this is a good for starter only thing i dont like are the ad that show when u unlock it
it wa great for my year old mother she u it for the bible
exceeds all expectation and perfect fit for my year old
bought for my son work great great tablet for the
grandson wanted this for birthday and he loved it
love my echo great skill and more ming online every day
surpassed my expectation it charge faster than the one that me with kindle fire when new so i would purchase another if i ever need a new one
i had an older kindle fire and had to upgrade a it eventually died i love the nvenience of book when i travel along with any apps i want
this is the right device to play with puzzle you can avoid samsung verizon nstant advertisement only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster
great for rd cutting just need a little cleaning up to do sorting through the ntent can be a little nfusing
amazon tv is a great item i love the fact that it can stream in k
i have had a nook for year and had a difficult time switching over to kindle despite the amazing review but i uld not pa up the price of this product i wa very pleasantly surprised with how great it is and i now use it all the time i m even thinking about getting my toddler one for christmas
purchased this for my granddaughter she is and love it
i did not think i would prefer an ereader to an actual book but i do it is easy to read easy to pause east to start back i do feel that it is a little awkward to hold and ill be ordering a leather ver case
bought this for my mother in law a her first tablet she love it great value
my granddaughter love this tablet it is durable
there are ton of apps and everyone can watch what they want with the micro sd card you never run out of space in my opinion is better than the apple tv i have both
it is very nvenient for reader and online use it work quickly and is great
initially it ha a hard time regnizing your voice but then it adapts and make everything so much easier it give me the daily news and tell bedtime story
i got this for my daughter a a gift but after seeing it action i think i need one for myself i think it almost like having an assistant
i purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which wa to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight i expected to hand it to my year old after my exam the surprise wa that really enjoy the device and in particular i like the amazon acunt integration on my next flight i wa delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my video for offline viewing the best part is that i upgraded the memory with a gb sd card so now my available ntent is awesome truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but best buy replaced my unit right away and i expect great thing with this new device my son also u it on long trip
i mostly use this for reading book and it just awesome easy to carry and nice clarity worth the amount spent

i m a longtime kindle user and jumped at the opportunity to bring my granddaughter into the fold with this gift she loved it
good product great price big improvement over my first tablet
my sister in law is in love with this best gift ever for her
verygood low end tablet rival some of the more expensive doe everything it say
so far it is a nice toy in the kitchen and it appears that there is a lot of up and ming apps that will be nice once they are all working right now it can only do basic stuff the speaker on it is just ok they uld improve that on the next upgrade i do not even think it is stereo
decent
worked right out of the box if i need another one i will buy one of these
seamless transition from old device easy to use mpletely happy
this gadget is amazing you can watch movie from if you are into that era
got this tablet for dollar perfect for travel and kid
this purchase replaced another kindle paperwhite that broke when dropped paperwhite is a great reader
you can read in the sun it hold more book than i can carry and you can read your own pdf file
the echo is great i use it every day great for music while doing the dish all i have to do is give a voice mmand and do not even have to dry off my hand every morning i wake up and cannot open my eye because i m so tired so instead of looking for the weather i just ask alexa and plan my day acrdingly
great quality for the price great for kid a it is not a huge loss if it break though i still remmend getting a protective ver for it
such a great product i have no mplaints i broughts this product for my family also and they love it
great product to watch show online only downside is that you cannot stream cast mputer screen easily like a chrome cast can being able to talk into the app or remote make it really easy to navigate the system to find thing fast
like i said it is very gimmicky unless you plan on turning the house into full automation tilt just gimmicky
the echo wa easy to set up and work wonderfully in the bedroom so far i have only used it to play music and check the weather i m looking forward to exploring all of alexa is capability
i bought this tablet and used it for two day and felt like returning it it didnhave play store amazon is version of android literally kill the processor and make it too slow web browsing through silk browser wa a pain it took for ever to load even simple page like google apps were all useless and the only thing you uld do is listen to preloaded music not streaming music and read ebooks anyway i changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it installed slimlp and got rid of amazon is junk and it made a huge difference the performance is way better and it actually work like a decent tablet now it is a great tablet for the price only if it rooted if you have no idea of rooting or do not like to risk it it not worth a penny it a good buy if you plan on rooting it
i purchased this tab a a gift for a family member they are very happy with this product and it is feature the application that me with this product are great happy to be a part of the amazon fire family
work great with our k tv upgraded from firestick and can really see the difference
screen is very clear and battery last a long time very good substitute if you can afford a ipad
it a great product easy to use and so easy to carry anywhere
it is great for reading in bed or anywhere for that matter
this is much better product than the fire stick itself i wa able to connect it via wifi or via the ethernet port fast easy and watching tv in le than min out of the box also you can download the remote to the fire tv for io me in handy when someone misplaced the remote
good affordable tablet my daughter love it buying at best buy wa easy and painless
wish it uld do more without subscribing to amazion prime bought this for my year old daughter she like it a lot but i think it uld be improved by not tying it to a monthly subscription service
once you get the amazon box you do not need to pay for cable again
work well setup is extremely easy replaced my directv subscription and we are very happy with it
echo is a fun device music sound good you can ask basic question nothing that apple is siri cannot already answer one big downfall is that the device is not rechargeable so the device is not portable you are tethered to the wall that is unless you buy the portable battery base for echo which will add another to an already price other than that it is easy to install
easy to read with a variety of ntent long battery duration
i cannot live without the kindle paper white it changed my reading habit and the kindle getting better and better highly remmended
perfect tablet for my grandkids easy for them to use a the parent can set up ntrols on this tablet abc mouse can be downloaded for preschool kid which is a plus purchased one for each of my grandchild so there is no more fighting of tablet great find thank you best buy also i purchased the insurance for these tablet because you know how little one are overall everyone wa very happy at christmas
i am still learning about my amazon fire tablet it wa easy for my to download book i wanted i think i am going to really like it once i have learned more about it
great price it is good for game play and great tablet with this price
i gave this a a gift a took a bit to get used to because it is not an android all and all a good buy
bought amazon fire tv this is not the replacement rd for my model be aware of what you are purchasing this is not a fit for the older fire model alternate non amazon power rds are available for the older version of fire tv on amazon
got for my year old the parental ntrols are nice i wish the netflix app wa registered a video so i uld give him minute of game and minute of video i m sure this work with purchased video maybe prime but not netflix he play star war angry bird and star war mmander and love them it is a good size for little hand it is great that a the parent i can buy a book or game and all device can use it even with each other if it is a multiplayer game i bought a cheap case elsewhere that also prop it up for hand free video watching
i got this for my mum and she wanted it to watch movie in bed or download a book it work well for this but a manual would have been a boon a she is older and not tech savvy it is not always easy or nvenient for an older person to use new tech without a struggle this wa not too bad in the end and she is enjoying it
i have received great feedback re how easy to use the size of it is perfect for kid easy to use
my wife treated me for my birthday and i love it would highly remmend took a little while to get used to buying book on amazon though overall excellent
it fit easily into smallest purse so it is always at hand when waiting in line while traveling lightweight especially without the case shape of back provides easy grip accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate but that is a minor thing
it wa a christmas gift for mom and dad they both love them and use them all the time it processor is pretty accurate but not too slow i would remmend a a gift
i wanted to give something to my younger brother without being precarious
work well probably best android tablet you can get for the money
i miss some of the feature that my nook e ink had specifically the home key however this ha served me well so far and the backlight is a nice feature
purchased to replace old kindle wa surprised at st difference though
i love this tablet this is the third one i have given out because i liked mine so much the price is just right and value is out of sight
i got this tablet for my son work good enough for his age i remmend this tab for kid
very good purchase for the price and back lit option is really usefult o read at night without having to have the light on
amazon fire tv doe a good job a a streamer the app market ha a good selection of apps i like the remote when you use the service they do a good job of making you want to be a prime member
i like the tablet this is my and tablet the first wa a zeepad zeepad wa a piece of you know what i like the fire though
i owned the last generation of kindle and i can say that this is a very nice update the screen is better backlighting remove the need for a book light and the reading experience is very delightful i would remmend this to anyone that want the best ereader in the market
this is a very responsive device for the amount paid
i bought this for my daughter for christmas they love it
this tablet is inexpensive and user friendly for my toddler he love it and u great educational apps
meet my need but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the oasis e reader
it work fine and is easy to use i would remmend it
the lighting of the paperwhite did not present any issue with glare easy on eye even while wearing sunglass outdoors
the amazon tap is a great mobile bluetooth speaker if you are invested in the amazon e system the produce good sound at all level play music stored in your associated cloud acunts and doe everything else the echo can do just with mobility added to it a opposed to the echo that always ha to be plugged into the wall to work
it freeze up a lot but it is great for reading not meant for other apps
tablet is great i am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle we started her at month on an ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost not so she is struggling to navigate in the kindle i am not able to transfer her game and movie
bought this a a gift for my year old nephew it is easy for him to use downloaded educational game for him to play great buy
easy to use page load fast i use it for e book
this is my nd tablet purchase at best buy and i am very satisfied with everything
reat product would greatly remmend this to my freinds
you have to purchase the power outlet light switch and other thing for alexa to mmunicate with once you do and setup them up it work pretty well you have to be careful if you put it near the tv where they might do a mmercial or a story about it on the news alexa ha pretty good hearing and perk up when she hears her name over all easy to set up with the app and work pretty well take some time getting used to asking alexa to turn on or off the light and not just reaching for the light switch
great product amazon doe a real good job giving you big bang for your buck the tablet is rapid and battery life is good
super easy to use with great video quality love it
easy to install get up and running easy to use work great
ha many function app or voice ntrolled great speaker qualit
watch what i want when i want no more cable bill
i do a lot of reading and it is just right for that
love alexa i have echo now and dot i have not played with them a lot but i love them it is nvenient to ask about the weather when you are getting ready for work or going out
like the tablet but didnrealize you had to put up with the ad also do not like how amazon block a lot of apps you can get around that though
this gift wa given to a relative who is hospitalized for an indefinite period of time perfect way to stay connected great alternative to purchasing hard py book
i bought this mostly to read the walking dead mics on and a book here and there it work great for that a slightly bigger screen would be better for the mics but bigger screen do not me for under i cannot speak to quality of video streaming or anything but it performs well for reading
great product but need to learn more it would be nice if it uld connect to tv sound
this wa a christmas present for the nephew work good he love it
great way to listen to music and great question answered
i bought this tablet on black friday and went home to test it out and it wa very slow and not worth the money
this wa a christmas gift andmy son is pleased with it
cheap and best product from amazon almost tab bought recently this show how i am inspired with table
thought this would be perfect for my two child the case warranty and pa to download unlimited apps seemed great however the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate which can be frustrating for child the case is a little too bulky and it can be nfusing for child who want to push an in to play but it instead downloads there is a definite learning curve that they will overme in time but it uld be more user friendly for younger user
this wa a gift for my parent they love using it for pandora and asking it about weather traffic etc very easy to use and very loud and clear speaker
i love my amazon tap i wa in the market for a portable speaker and i saw these one on sale so i decided to pick it up i only wanted it for a bluetooth speaker but alexa is amazing i use it everyday alexa wa a huge plus
this tablet is great not the best but it wa only
myself and my two kid have these tablet the do exactly what i need them for to read and watch streaming show they have game for my kid and they are cheap so if they break them i m not to worried
this kindle is much faster than my old one great buy
i love using alexa she will play music when asked play game answer question and start my day with a good morning and end each evening with a good night
work very well i do ish it had some of the feature of the google picked this one cause it can have three acunts at one time
good but not overall a capable or mprehensive a i wa hoping will ntinue to explore capability and apps
this is perfect cause my nephew is more calm this tablet is awesome he love it
i really enjoy the echo and the power of alexa there are so many different skill that is ha something for everyone and while it is used for home automation there are many thing you can do with it if you do not have any other connected home device the only reason i give it a out of is that the speaker quality uld be a little better for music i mpetes in quality with bluetooth product in the range but system like the bose sound link mini are still superior in sound quality
this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hand free mode work just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on project making shopping list playing game to turning on the light i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didnseem very mobile
the sole purpose of purchasing the kindle fire tablet wa reading i own a samsung tablet and when attempting to read i beme distracted with social medium and game right now my fire table only ha apps utilized for reading and video and i have been able to stay focused i love the portability of the fire
great box for playstation vue and kodi work great and easy to set up
i absolutely love my echo i greet her in the morning and she greets me back and sometimes ha an occasion to talk about i love that she play music too
work great with everything thing i use battery last long but get hot with game
work flawlessly most of the time would be star if amazon would stop fighting against people rooting their device it is our streaming box let u do what we want with it
i love my amazon echo i use it for my lighting to play music shopping list timer information and the list go on make simple task a little more fun love getting my shopping list on my phone
very good for kid to use play game and watch kid video
it is more lightweight than my keyboard kindle love it
excellent price good quality you cannot ask more for so little money
i would remmend this streaming device for anyone trying to cut rds and save money
mostly just use it for the speaker still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding
screen wa cracked but the package did arrive earlier than expected
i love my fire and the fact that i now have a place for my library that is not taking up space on my phone
small and look good on end table good sound wireless is great
got fort my kid had christmas and birthday money wanted their own tablet and worked good a we are prime member

we bought this for my father is tv he is so happy with it he can easily navigate throught all the apps and play what he want i can only say this product work really good
easy to carry in purse or pocket but doe not do anything better than the cheapest kindle reader

i m not sure this device would have gotten much use if i didnhave any home automation device it is very ntinent to ask alexa to turn off certain light set my thermostat to a certain temp and trigger event through ifttt i really do not use any of the other feature like creating list or scheduling event but i do use the timer function while i am in the kitchen the reason i gave it star instead of other device cannot utilize my echo is speaker i would like for smartthings to be able to integrate with my echo to announce when someone walk through a main entry door or if my garage door open which i know other wi fi connected speaker are capable of doing echo to echo connectivity would also be a nice feature being able to say play music in all room or while standing in the kitchen play music in the living room
bought this for my son who is in llege he ha most of his class book online and wanted this tablet to read his urse book versus having to tote around his laptop all the time he u it almost exclusively and love the small light option to carrying his laptop all the time

a great buy a a send wife to my husband she ha all the answer without the smart mouth she listen and most of all she shut is her mouth
the echo is easy to use and lot of fun i even bought one for my parent they love it too
this is an ok device decent speaker for casual listening the voice regnition is not good though when you have to yell and repeat mmands over and over it get frustrating
cheap tablet but solid built weak audio and poor camera
got this a a gift formy son a he wanted to have netflix in his room
great product would have given star only problem is that it kinda freeze at time after having it on standby for a few hour so i have to restart it from the menu setting other than that it is an awesome product
i bought this tablet a bestbuy wa closing them out i find the screen is okay but not ipad quality the speed is fine for my intended use but i would not be happy if i needed to use a my primary tablet the operating system is lower then the current android build and i have not found a upgrade path
now that this support hand free access and amazon ha disntinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device
if you re expecting something like an ipad leave your expectation at the door this is a great little tablet for losing track of time while you read play a game connect with family friend or watch a show i have had ipads for year and have loved using them just getting tired of the price tag that me with them
the tablet work great and charge with in on hour boight for my kid

this kindle is by far the best one i have had i have zero mplaints
i bought of them a gift for my nephew it wa really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my amazon acunt i started getting notice everything is they downloaded something i had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my acunt before they made a big purchase which they did purchase amazon prime which i cancelled because i wa not ready for a purchase
upgraded to this unit from a paperwhite that i left on a plane somewhere i find this unit to be a lot crisper a lot speedier and overall more pleasurable to use i purchased the amazon brand leather type case with stand up foot it add a bit of girth to hold on to while reading the unit is incredibly slim battery life is excellent even when using the backlight

my granddaughter love it u it a lot help with her homework
tablet need an extra storage card quickly if kid are downloading game but otherwise it is a very good buy for kid that have never had a tablet before
this version ha some advantage and upgrade mpared to the previous version but it is missing the optical audio out outside of that the device work fine just not a fan of amazon is version of android still a good deal for what it is
this wa a great buy for my son he needed something that he uld easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various form of medium this wa a perfect choice since he also ha a amazon prime acunt
i wa not overly impressed with this system i didnrealize you have to buy amazon prime in order to use the function it didnnnect easily to my phone it would not just stream music saved on my iphone i had to download a music app and then load my music into the app it would not work way too much work and added expense in order to use wa not happy with that so i returned it and purchased a jbl portable bluetooth speaker
this is a great little tablet for the money and doe nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet i plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive ipad air home i wa impressed with the resolution when viewing photo and it work well for reading email and internet surfing it is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit probably the major drawback is the camera which doe not take a very good picture when mpared to cell phone and other tablet again for the money it is a great value for a small tablet
i would say that it is not for kid is because my kid have been downloading game after game even with a gig sd card the main operating system only allows about gig of game that cannot be transferred to the data card so storage is very limited
i wish i didnwait to get this it is so much faster than using a dvd player for apps like hulu and netfliz plus the voice serach is handy
my granddaughter love it it wa a perfect gift for her long airplane trip
excellent sound and great value used every day by entire family
i m a big outdoor reader so the paperwhite is perfect for me

this is great for when you link your acunts and ask alex to play them for you however her ai and speech regnition still need some improvement pairing your mobile device to the echo is great a well for all those service not yet supported by amazon
fantastic tablet fire one is great small and portable

it is great this wa a gift but my son love it remmending it
i purchased of the kindle tablet for our grandchild i wa pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tablet nsidering the price the grandchild would always head for my kindle when they came over now that they have their own they never ask for mine they use them nstantly mostly to play game but they also stream video and even use them to help with school work it wa a great buy
this work very well for a reader but if you want to browse online it is not so good the default silk browser is slow side loaded opera and it is slow chrome is slow and firefox is slow so i have to assume that it is the fire that is slow wifi browsing but then it wa an inexpensive piece of hardware
it is a very good one for my child to play with so
love the blue tooth remote doe freeze up from time to time
i love it portability the speaker are phenomenal
my kid is enjoying the product it serf the need for her wish she uld watch some of the prime movie when she is on freetme
it is little slow at start up but once it up it work great for the price it is a great device i play basic game they run smoothly
amazon echo alexa is great the echo ha a fantastic speaker so when you want to hear some is hit or modern jazz or relaxing background music just ask it is really helpful for those little trivia bit of info you wonder about when you re watching tv and usually look up on your phone then end up checking your email facebook etc and miss half of the show we have hue light in room of our house which operate with a phone app they are great i definitely remmend them also but it is wonderful to be able to ask to have the light turned on when you need to go to the kitchen in the dark or when your hand are full or at night when you need all the light off it is very user friendly just one app and about minute set the whole thing up i gave it to my husband for christmas it is the best gift ever

i love this kindle i had one of the first fire hd kindles that is still kicking and awesome but when i saw this in the store i just had to have it i think it is more user friendly and feel like it offer so many more option and function than the fire hd i have not to mention it dwarf my last kindle in size if i had to make one mplaint it is that there is not an auto brightness function or at least i have not found it and you cannot make your page a cream lor rather than stark white both those option were easier on my eye but i am testing out the blue shade mode to see if that help a much a it is supposed to with night time bed time reading all in all i am extremely happy with this purchase
purchased this a a christmas gift for my girlfriend she absolutely love it and u it every day she is very picky about electronics and she love her tablet so it must be good
i purchased this because i can add memory to it and it is the best kindle i have bought so far this is about the fifth one i have purchased i like it so much that i bought one for my kid a well
this tablet is fantastic for the price it is a good or better than my first fire the only difference are this one ha only gb is of storage but ha front and rear camera it run a fast a the other and the resolution is a good
alexa is great she play music she can answer question and tell you the weather i am still learning all that she can do
work very well easy to use and straightforward would remmend it to anyone
i use this every day on my mmute great battery life no backlight but very readable with normal lighting i like the built in dictionary email yourself pdf or mobi file for easy transfer
i honestly didncare for it the newest version of this tablet are by far much better you have a bit more freedom with it than you do the older version
it is a very solid e reader nothing wrong with it at all
my daughter is totally enjoying her tablet recently though it is not charging rrectly i will me to store to have it looked at
it function well and meet all my need a an entry level tablet the only downside is that everything on it is geared toward amazon but the price make up for it
work great without having to startup your laptop to look up item on amazon
i had a kindle paperwhite that i d bought in summer and by summer something had gone funky it wa not charging anymore so i upgraded to one with a higher ppi a uple month ago the difference is slight in fact i have not noticed it at all if i went back to my old kindle i d probably notice that the quality had changed but really it is a very minor upgrade but that doe not matter because the paperwhite is awesome anyway i am a woman and i can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jean so dude definitely can it slip into small purse and it hold a charge for week i have a pretty big llection of physical book but i really enjoy having a library on a tablet that i can bring with me too i buy physical book when i want to linger around a book store or for poetry or book that i want to high light or share with people or that i like the vers of i buy kindle book that i really want for the story or that are on sale on the kindle store or classic that are cheap a uple buck or free the vocabulary builder is really nice i just highlight and lookup word that i want to know more about then it provides a definition for me and save the word a a flash card so that i can practice later at my nvenience i use my kindle at night the back light is perfect for reading right before bed i wholeheartedly remmend this device if you just want a reading tablet i might get another tablet for watching tv or playing game but i just wanted a dedicated reading one and this is perfect for me
one of the best purchase i have ever made it is tie into my whole home network and work with all of my phone and other product
purchased this for my son for organization purpose which ended up beming the family personal assistant love the apps and the capability this nifty gadget ha
this speaker is forte is it is drop and charge ability it doe connect with no issue to whatever you have it paired with the sound quality though is ok def not very loud and lack the low but for a small portable speaker which is not expensive i would remmend it
the display is not great but can be used a a back up device for rough use
gotten for my granddaughter and she u it all the time other than having to charge so much because of frequent use there have been no problem with it good purchase
ol item for a great price purchased when on sale so wa like great little tablet

have you nsidered buying a kindle for your kid this is the one to get anything else and you re over spending pro great app selectiongreat free apps due to undergroundextremely affordablesd card supportns bad storage management when you run out of internal space the device stop functioning rrectly

it really doe a good job of replacing my old tablet market uld be better but that is about it
when you first turn on the kindle the home screen doe not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book
great for accessing satellite radio information search weather report etc

amazon echo doe a lot of thing keep todo and shopping list for you play music just by asking keep your schedule using google calendar ha some great game including trivia game i would buy it again in a send
great tablet for the price i would remmend this to friend and family
the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drop frequently and even when it show it connected can fail to download any data perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later sw update but for now i have to say the performance is underwhelming the backlight also ha some serious bleed issue which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship the fire hd which i also own ha none of these issue get what you pay for ring true again
i have wanted a kindle for a while and decided to get it when bb put it on sale i am not disappointed
it is really great and i like the lor but there is a crack on the screen protector i do not know it is the shipment or i squeezed it
black friday deal for regularly worth it at too not a replacement for a laptop but good battery life and perfect for surfing the net e mail amazon ntent etc bought a ver for it on amazon
great price for a tablet i got two of them one for each if my child ranging from and year old only down part i cannothink of is the charging port going bad it is super ooose and hard to charge
i think it is a awesome device if you like tok stream
i loved my book vers and the feeling of a book in my hand but after reading untless review i gave in and bought a kindle now i cannot imagine reading without it after ton of booklights that died on me and heavy book that never fit in my bag i can read anywhere anytime and in any lighting i only wish the kindle store wa not so biased to kindle unlimited it doe not list the top book it list people who pay the be on there so you do not get genuine remmendations still i will never read the same again if you want to look up the mean of the word merely click it if you want to make the font bigger you can do so and if you want to see better raise the brightness it is so much easier on the eye than reading on my ipad
apple orange they re both fruit both tasty but they are different at the same time when thinking about the new fire tablet keep in mind that this is not a high end samsung or ipad mini it doe a lot of the same thing but it is different it sts a fraction of the st with that perspective in mind this is a fantastic value in fact short of finding a nice nd tier asus lg or lenovo tablet being pushed on disunt site probably a refurbs you re not going to find anything that me close in value to this new fire tablet prior to getting it i had my ncerns particularly with the screen given the lower resolution i have a dozen tablet and have tried about a dozen others and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on amazon got this right it is not a crisp a my older kindle fire hd or my galaxy note or my ipad mini but for casual reading gaming video viewing email etc the screen is just fine world beyond most low end budget tablet i have tried especially anything sting under new my daughter who ha been using a kindle fire hd ha not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution the new fire o operating system look feel much more like android or io which is nice overall it still is not perfect but overall i think it make for a much better user experience than the version on older kindle fire tablet the gb of internal storage is of urse paltry but with the very welme addition of a microsd slot carrying load of medium with you for offline nsumption is not an issue what remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if when the little bit of available internal storage get filled with apps and other ntent so far this ha not been a problem the inclusion of both front and rear facing camera is a nice bonus no you re not going to capture great shot but both camera are usable and add value the speaker are ok volume and quality is not great but is acceptable for general use and of urse you can also use headphone or an external speaker to kick thing up a notch or several notch if you have or more to spend on a tablet and plan on using it quite a bit then you can definitely find something a bit nicer if you re getting this for just occasional use or for a kid and are not accustomed to using a high end tablet then this is a fantastic buy i have tested over tablet and for a sub tablet this is absolutely a great value at it current price of it is a no brainer kudos to amazon for raising the bar on budget tablet and making quality tablet available to the mass
a an amazon prime member i figured this would be ol to play my amazon prime music but it is also a bluetooth speaker that i can play my xm radio or itunes through alexa is getting smarter and know my voice better with every question she ha my appointment and traffic and weather vered every morning great item here and great sounding speaker
i have amazon prime and this is a must for it very happy with it
still learning all that the amazon echo can do keep my calendar my to do list and entertains me she help with my budget with you need a budget and much more with all the available apps love the amazon echo cannot wait to find out all she can do
alexa is really awesome she doe all kind of ol thing to make life easier my only remmendation to amazon is that they try to make her more intuitive and remember habit or repeated phrase
i am currently using this item it is very good product
my kid love theirs no problem out of this tablet
i bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he uld use it at school and play game on the kindle he love it
excellent grandchild love them they were so excited to receive this and have not put it down since even my year old is having a ball
i brought this for my nephew he love it doe everything that the high dollar tablet do but at a fraction of the the st a very good buy
loved the fire hd but the latest hd is sharper faster and still handle great
e reader battery doe not hold up a long a stated
this came in the remmended bundle and work well
easy to set up very responsive excellent sound quality
tablet is great for the price not a fast a my is but pretty darn good for the price
while most avid reader will say that you cannot match the physical quality of a book a part of the overall reading experience this is pretty nvenient the soft glow of the screen doe not assault your eye after an extended reading session and it fit nicely in the hand too
this is a great tablet for my gra d kid christmas present
i love this kindle and bought it for the upgrade to replace my original kindle fire i would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the picture me out grainy and not very clear great for watching show and video and these are very clear love playing game on it and of urse reading the latest book

great tablet for my kid to use plenty of apps to choose easy to set up and add parental ntrols cheap enough a well for what my kid use it for game and video instead of spending time a much on a different tablet
i bought this tablet during black friday for dollar and it is well worth the price definitely an upgrade from the first gen tablet
had to buy sims card for more storage but good choice for kid
this is easy to set up we love the music and looking up info
the price is really attractive and kindle is good to use
i bought this to fill my life with music the first two week were fantastic i got amazon music and needed only to say alexa play insert artist name song name or album name and it would play music the speaker quality is great day after christmas it went into a christmas music and hymn default whatever artist i requested it would play the first song and then default to religious music i d switch artist and it d happen again i contacted amazon and wa told not to request artist i needed to specify album and song i do not have this info memorized i bought it to say artist name someone responding to my poor review on amazon suggested trying different music service i dumped amazon music and started requesting music on pandora alexa misunderstood my granddaughter request and played christmas music on pandora although we were now well into jan i m no longer having the christmas music problem but alexa is just ok playing music from pandora sometimes it get it right sometimes not i am so disappointed in it that i plug it in when i want to hear music and unplug it and ignore it most of the time when it worked the first two week i raved about it after witnessing my problem people who me over do not want one
i love so far process at decent speed i have been able to do what i need without problem i only wish all the apps on screen didnhave to be visible cannot enjoiy a screen saver if it vered with in

cheap good always dependable tablet now just useless word to take up minimum
this inch fire is definitely better than the cheaper inch it work fine enough for teen to play game and watch movie
we bought this because we thought it would be great for reading book and playing a few game however awkward size make the device very weird to hold and generally not enjoyable the fire hd share the exact same spec and ha a higher battery life there is almost no reason to take this device over the
really smart and quick with answer reminder and alarm are great have to be careful on how loud you say alexia when talking because it is very sensitive great product
cumbersome mplicated and not kid friendly went with apple suggesting you do too
bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working i found all my cloud item already available being prime member

before i bought this i had a blue tooth speaker and an ipod touch both of which had to be charged and turned on etc now i just tell alexa to play music

i love my kindles this is the th one the others i wore out i enjoy this one the most easier researching thing lot more option etc
the spec are good feel solid cannot stand the o too many ad you cannot get rid of not a customizable a i d like if that doe not bother you it is a good tablet for the price do not expect to run game on it not powerful enough for that

the speaker is very good i have had no problem with it understanding my mmands i enjoy having alexa around the house
it is a really good tablet for child good parental ntrols expandable up to gig i like that so it allowed me to download a many thing for the child to utilize separate from the internet all around is a good device

this tablet doe a great deal from surfing the net to watching movie and using all of the music channel this is an affordable way to stay in touch also i use it for ebooks for school
love reading so this is very nveniet after all
this fire box is the best you can get for a cheap price it run surprising well and so far have had no issue with wifi streaming hulu amazon prime and netflix definitely even worth more if you have prime for the streaming from amazon only minor problem is restriction on most add on apps due to going through amazon and not google play but there are various work arounds
the person i bought this for really loved the product it wa mpact enough to carry to the beach yet large enough to read from the price when purchased wa amazing and you cannot beat it for speed and ease of using
pretty good at understanding what you say cannot do everything you would think or hope but for the most part get the job done
i really wanted a value item to load listen to audio book both while at home and on the road this is perfect so quick and easy to load book via an app or the free library app pleasantly surprised such a great little reader
this little device is great it ha a quick set up and easy instruction
it is just ok for a tablet it doe not have google play store of urse which limit a wide variety i would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope it is slow and browser doe not load page with flash or graphic good poor camera but it function ok for a cheap tablet i didnexpect a lot but did expect better from kindle
easy to use great gor reading easy to download book
very happy with streaming choice the firestick tv

purchased a new kindle because my original wa very out of date ha more memory larger screen and doe not freeze up love it
echo seems well engineered the voice response is very natural and usually understands what i m saying echo would not connect to my home wifi because i had two network with the same ssids one ghz and one ghz once i changed the name ssid of one of the network echo connected right up and ha not had any trouble since because of the wifi issue i took star away
i own the apple tv and i wanted to try out the fire tv and am glad i did
the touch ntrol page change ntrols are a little to sensitive web browser too experimental
good product for listening to and reading book also work well when u do not want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop
i really wa pleasantly surprised by how well alexa is able to understand the mmands
this is the best streaming device to watch movie on or even netflix
great speaker and alexa is so awesome great price
the amazon fire tv is a great way to watch your favorite show and movie it is easy to use and the best part it wa not too expensive
i have been trying to cut the rd on cable dish for a while now this definitely make it much easier and i m saving a few buck however it doe have some glitch every once and while it will freeze but it is very unmmon and uld be my internet and not the box i cannot dock it too many star would still remmend

i purchased a amazon fire tablet for my husband who ha never used one it wa easy to set up to help him get started i moved the apps that he wanted to use to the top of the screen in no time he wa taking and storing his picture and searching the internet the only thing we wish it would do better is turn on faster
easy to set it up and it is paying for itself because i m cancelling some cable channel

i purchased the kindle fire a a replacement for my nook tablet my hope wa that it would be a reasonable replacement for what i essentially wa primarily using a an e reader it ha surpassed all of my expectation at a much more reasonable st
i own in my household to me no other streaming box me close a definite must buy
best streaming device by far easy set up and easy to nfigure
my kid love them very good and they enjoy playing there game and music
the screen flush with the side is great the glass feeling is really nice i do not use the side button for page turning but only because of habit they are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing page but the price is painful it is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about a good in nearly every respect
my wife love the tablet it is light weight
when they first announced the kindle oasis i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my st generation kindle paperwhite just a i felt when they announced the voyage i read a lot so my kindle travel with me throughout the day most of the time i have never had an issue with battery life i have only had it get really low a few time typically when i wa traveling so again i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasis a the review for the oasis came out i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot especially when i wa in a seated position this slight reduction in weight made it much more mfortable to hold for longer reading session i had some other minor issue with my paperwhite like when reading in the dark i uld not find an adjustment for the light that i preferred wa a little too dim and wa a brighter than i needed i decided to pa on the voyage because i really did not like the case option and the pressure sensitive page turn option now that i have the oasis i definitely think it wa worth it for me i really appreciate the reduced weight when the ver is off not to mention the ease of removing the ver mpared to the paperwhite it provides the same reading experience although i did get a resolution upgrade mpared to my older paperwhite which is a plus the oasis is really mfortable in my hand which help me forget that it is there when i wa holding my paperwhite with my left hand at time i would accidentally go back a page which drove me crazy even though it just a minor innvenience i have the black model because it wa the only option available unless i wa willing to wait a few more month the build quality of the oasis and it case is very nice just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it the only ncern i have is how well it will protect the kindle i will update the review if i find this to be a problem i loved my paperwhite and i will remmend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time it definitely is great and the better buy but i am glad i decided to order the oasis the reduced weight ergonomic design and page turn button make it worth the added st
omg who need a personal assistant when you have alexa love it
i like the fun we have with it but i wish it wa a better quality speaker system for music
good tablet for the price only drawback is the limited apps for the fire mpared to android tablet
the tablet is very light and stream well i only use it to stream movie and it is much ligher then an ipad so make mobility that much better
this is great for ur tv if an amazon customer only thing alexa need improvement
light backlight make it easy to read easy to operate reasonably priced
love my amazon fire tablet because it is not too small and not too big it is just the right size it is light weight and the resolution is very good i remmend it highly
i have been wanting to give these little tablet a try for some time now i went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale i m originally an apple guy but my ipad ha seen better day the tablet is nestled in mpact packaging inside you will find the sync cable charger and the tablet itself it me wrapped in a protective plastic bag it look pretty good quality and feel great in my hand it is very easy to grasp with one hand leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do the setup is really straight forward with a few simple question if you are already an amazon customer you will be asked to input your information during setup making it even easier to get started the picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet it is not hd but the quality is still pretty good for everyday task amazon is app store is packed with ton of apps movie book etc there is definitely plenty to choose i have access to amazon video store and everything amazon at the palm of my hand the only downside to the tablet is that amazon u it own silk browser which i am not a very big fan of i tried to see if i uld download chrome but that is still not an option hopefully it will be some time in the future the browser is a bit slow in certain web page but functional another thing that i found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e mail acunt to the tablet the only thing that i notice wa that it took a while to load my acunt but the setup is very easy you have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hand overall this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low st tablet it may take some folk a some time to get use to amazon is o but it should not take very long to do so

satisfied customer with product for small child very durable amazon fire rock
you need gooooood wifi for this if the wifi is not good like it is in and out this will not work that good you also need the app to set up alexa i would only remmend this if you have great wifi
i like that you can set parental setting so the kid cannot purchase without you knowing about it great warranty also a a separated for the kid and the parent
work excellent with playstation is vue service push amazon ntent pretty hard so if you do not have a prime membership it may get annoying ditched cable and picked up the firetv box uld not be happier
like the product a lot mostly use it for playing music not very useful though if you have a bad isp
i like this fun to play someone did a great job
when i bought the echo back in my wife hated it and said she will never talk to inanimate object fast forward and we use it to turn off light turn on the tv set the thermostat listen to music and even a an interm system the echo are the center of our home automation the only negative i can see is that sometimes i do feel that it is always listening to every nversation but i guess there is a mute button for that
excellent tablet for kid doe everything that an i pad can do

i am very happy with my e reader it is so practical for reading along with my daughter she ha one a well and we use them to read every night a required by her th grade class curriculum
it is one of the best tablet in the market for the price
the better choice from the others especially if you are a prime member easy to set up and to use voice remote and now with alexa built in the better choice
have not personally used this tablet but my niece like it
i have used other e reader and picked this a a early christmas present for myself while i primarily use it for book i have used it a a tablet i would remmend it for anyone
the echo wa very easy to setup but took a little time to figure out proper phrase to ntrol device what amazon downplays though is that this is more of a gateway and doe not ntrol device without network
this amazon echo mplements the other home automation product i currently have it work great with my wemo light and my nest thermostat i highly remmend this for anyone wanting to automate their home
no issue whatsoever work well best e reader there is

it is the right size to throw into a purse because it is light weighteasy set up enter your wifi password and amazon login info then wooo the display is bright no dead pixel on mine and responsive touch sensitivity is very good the fire good design and slim in sizegood product with money
this product doe exactly what i wanted it to do and is good value for the purchase price
i bought one for myself and a uple a gift it is cute but still have not figured out what is so great about it i will say that it doe pick up your voice throughout a huge room
easy to use lot of book obviously but also lot of apps
simple set up range of activity make for something new each interaction
amazon echo is so incredibly ol the only thing that would make it better would be if i uld call it jarvis when i speak to it i would totally feel like iron man once you setup your iheart radio pandora jam and amazon prime your music possibility are endless it will also give you news headline weather wake up alarm etc you cannoteach it skill such a telling joke random pick up line or even pootering on demand my kid love that it ha a quite extensive poot library something i never thought i d say one warning it get expensive quick i had it two day and wa already back at best buy buying a phillips hue starter kit so i uld ntrol my bedroom light by voice not mention that you can order using amazon prime by voice although some setup to do so is required a far a the overall initial nfiguration is very easy the sound is very good and it make a great blue tooth speaker a well
awesome love how easy it is to read and use even when i amat the beach
great tab purchased a a give for a christmas party
the kindle paperwhite is light and i love the backlight it is great for basic reading
i like it but can get more info i use google cannot answer very many question the music feature is work well
i d say for the price it wa a decent tablet it did what i needed it to do but the support i d say through the app side wa a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet amazon also doe a lot of advertisement on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple page on your home screen which can be rather annoying and unremoveable otherwise i used it to watch video surf the web and use a few social medium apps good for kid too both video and game side so i d say in general for the price it is a decent tablet but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better
the parental ntrols are amazing super easy for my daughter to operate
use it often for alarm and music would remmend for everyone
just ok even for the low price of it is more like a toy than a tablet
seriously it is great and you should have one

these were ordered one for year old and then ordered send one for year old they are easy to use and age appropriate apps for each of them
i have had an ipad and iphone for year which also allow me to read my kindle library but the paperwhite ha three advantage you can see it in bright sunlight the charge will last for week and because it is much cheaper it is le vulnerable to theft and le of a loss if it is damaged i bought the internet version but it is also available with a connection to the kindle net which enables you to download book anywhere even where there is no access to internet
like most androd device ha slowed down nsiderably over time since purchase nice for video watching but browsing the internet is slow at time apps take awhile to load good for the price
my son love this tablet i love all the child security i can put on it
the amazon kindle fire is great for amazon shopping it offer game music movie and more that only the kindle fire with amazon can offer it truely meet a star rating from me the kindle fire ha a very mpetitive price when nsidering other device

all of our kid age and have had their own kindle fire for almost two year they re generally pretty careful with them since they have been told that broken kindles will not be replaced in one case the kindle simply stopped working it would no longer turn on there wa a great deal going on so we did replace it what a perfect product for a child so many apps are available and they can learn new thing while thinking they re just having fun
he love to play game and watch video and take pic

every time i ask alexa for something my year old grandson run over and try to pronounce her name he is almost there hopefully he ll have a question for her a well he like dancing to the nursery rhyme that i ask her to play for him
you get what you pay for it is and that is about the quality you get overall work great but slow and crash occasionally not the best battery
i do not know much about tablet but the sale associate remmended this one for me it doe what i need and more but i just do not know how to use it yet
gifted to kid and they liked it screen resolution is not great but sufficient
amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e book it is also nice to get a six month subscription to the washington post their claim to have gigabyte of storage is misleading because it only give you and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage another problem is that you cannot flag something a being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablet
got it for my son and he love it definitely would remmend it
this device work great and is capable of so much
i had a firestick and moved it to my wife tv decided to get this for the replacement it is much more fluid and integrates with my alexa via the voice remote you will like it

it ha some learning to do but it great to have it play my amazon music anywhere
i thing is ol too can listen to radio get news from cnn fox but if you do not have amazon prime it is dumb a a brick
it is a nice cheap small tablet to keep around for vids fire tv remote etc
we love playing music and radio with it or kid ask question and it is quite entertaining
love it i use it for reading and netflix and hulu
the fire is a decent pad for basic u the only downside is the way the fire automatically link with your amazon acunt also the ad are annoying and clearly designed to increase your amazon purchase more than anything else

this replaced a kindle hdx with gb of ram the older tablet had a charging port that wa not functioning anymore had the geek squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the hd a his new tablet other than the screen resolution being lower and le memory great tablet my son didncare about the resolution and the new kindles let you pop in an sd card for more storage popped in a gb sd card and he is a happy camper now
this amazon fire tablet is a nice little tablet picture is sufficient for the price audio output is on back so if it is in a case the sound is muted but otherwise nice tablet for the price

i m so glad i purchased this i did have the older version with the smaller screen and what a difference it make having the larger screen it is volume clarity are great it is light and easy to use i would absolutely remmend this to anyone who is on the fence and thinking about purchasing it
alexa is exactly what i expected it to be best father is day gift
i think it is a good starter tablet for a child it make it a lot easier to monitor your child while online
it ha helped me not need the cable mpany and their many unnecessary channel
we got this for my mom for christmas so she can play game it is absolutely perfect for her a it is bigger than her phone she can see it much better
we love the echo we are having fun learning all of the possibility of option it can do we have even traveled with it and it work fine great speaker excellent sound
echo is fun for the family you can play music game get news and weather
ideal for nvenient music playback when walking in at the end of the day
a bit mplicated the process of loading book bought in different store to amazon it should be more user friendly for new user we do not me from amazon
purchased this for a gift for a year old who is enjoying it a she learns all of the amazing thing it can do she love playing solitaire and downloading current book to read before she go to bed at night easy fun inexpensive tablet for even the least tech savvy people
i am still learning what all the echo can do but it is awesome i love the shopping list the timer just being silly with game working on getting plug and light switch to ntrol the house
it is ok i love that i can set up my year old on his own with the child is setting the battery dy really fast though we cannot even make it through a long car ride without having to plug it in
we bought these tablet for our child age through for gameplay so they uld stay off of my samsung tablet hallelujah they absolutely love them the only problem that i have with tablet is the length of the rd on the charger it is too short if you want to ntinue play while it is charging you have to literally sit right next to the electrical source we remedied this problem by exchanging the rd for a longer one that we had around the house
i love the ability to make my shopping list by just telling alexa to add the item the shopping list is always with me on the phone app when my kid use the last of something they can add it to the list no more forgotten item it is the easiest way to find out the forecast for your day just ask no more getting on the mputer or checking your phone really good sound for playing amazon music too just ask for a song and it play
it make reading at night much easier easy access to book that are of interest

if you re already fully mmitted to the amazon esystem a in you have a prime acunt then this is a decent buy i found it hard to get used to having advertisement in your face and all the amazon branding you see everywhere aside from those annoyance the device itself is quite sleek and work fine for netflix hulu amazon video streaming playing file directly from a usb drive or micsosd card wa a bit clunky but still do able an active internet connection is required to use most feature of the device
the grandkids needed some research help for school i researched and found that the amazon tablet wa the the best for any age best but wa the best place to go for the best buy and price
great buy for the price we currently own of them buying my grandson one for christmas too
amazon alexa is amazing doe more then i imagined easy to install and quick to learn how to use alexa is used each and everyday
the accuracy it ha understanding the word is really good and clear small thing i didnlike is to make her higher to max volume you need to repeat it like to time also in max volume is you must be really close to it so it uld listen to you planning on buying the remote ntrol soon
