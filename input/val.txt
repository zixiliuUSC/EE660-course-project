just what you need for an ereader front lighting is very natural and doe not give me a headache like trying to read on backlight screen like my ipad
good intro tablet gb is not much space but it is a good starter for someone new to a tablet for those that cannot afford an ipad or similar this is a step down of urse but it a good introduction
i replaced my roku box with the fire tv a i prefer it interface
good tablet for the price it quick and easy to use
it all of a sudden ha stoped charging i have only used it a few time in the short time off purchase can i get a replacement or how best can i be helped
we use this everyday of the week all the option it ha make it perfect for everyone setup wa easy a is using it everyone should have one
i purchased this tablet because i saw that it wa at an affordable price point for me with this it is really not that bad the only thing i have found to be able a little bit annoying is that it is a little awkward to hold handle when i m playing my game the send issue i have found with this type of tablet is that it is made out of plastic it noisy the overall performance is quite impressive though good price point with good intention just a little cheap feeling a little big in the hand to hold
i have loved kindles from the first time i turned one on i now read about book a year that is a lot for me i finally upgraded to the paperwhite for the backlight feature i take it with me everywhere in case i have an extended wait time somewhere but i mostly use it in bed the size make it easy to hold it is a lot better then holding a cumbersome book and doe not hurt a much when i start to doze off and drop it on my face i have set the text size big enough to read without my glass get in bed turn on the backlight and read in the dark good for reading in sunlight too i only read book with my kindle so i didnsee the need to buy the fire and i only needed the wi fi version no g desired i also didnsee the need to pay more for the voyage
cannot beat the price awesome for kid and doe not break the bank
doe the job kid are kinda of rough with it holding up well
i m very happy with this it is easy to use and i d remmend this
i bought this for my daughter and she absolutely love this kindle it is a good size and the price wa right
it is a good product if you use amazon apps for movie and music i myself use google and cromecast so i found that the google home worked better for me
funny thing since steve job ha passed away techie have been waiting for the next great thing from apple and sadly it more of the same well amazon did all techie a favor with this invention something apple should have done with siri but didnhands free alexa who hears your mmand percent of the time instead of haha aka siri team this up with a smart hub like phillip lightbulb and a nest system and a harmony hub and you living like ironman

have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time it an extra for u we keep it in the living room
replaced my wife is standard kindle with the paper white edition she love the backlit screen
this thing is awesome good volume blend in with the room and is easy to setup
very easy to set up sound is really good the microphone work well and alexa is responsive great assistant
not good hate it never buy it again suck done
such a high dpi look like printed the book are much cheaper
i am very happy with my purchase of the kindle paper white i wanted a device for reading at night that would allow me to turn the light off in the room work well is lightweight and really a joy to read on very limited and dissappointing selection of protective vers at best buy had to purchase elsewhere
this is the perfect product for listening to internet radio at the gym without having to buy a smart phone and an expensive data plan i selected the gym is wireless signal downloaded the sirius xm app put in my earphone purchased separately and began listening since this item wa part of a black friday sale my total st wa well under it is small enough to carry with me and the screen is easy to read
very good picture quality performs a advertised and worth the prize paid for
the e alexa is an amazing piece of technology design is sleek and unnoticeable
it is great since you can plug into an rj connector it is much faster than the fire stick
the amazon firestick with voice remote is very easy to set up and very easy to use the voice remote make finding what you want to watch very easy
i observe my year old granddaughter using this tablet with ease she is able to play some of the game and upload movie her mom had to put a secret password for the movie because she downloaded some that you had to pay for
the paperwhite wa the perfect upgrade to my older kindle that required a light in order to read in low light nditions
i wa initially excited to get the kindle i am extremely disappointed with all the ad even more disappointed to find out that i uld pay amazon more money to remove the ad it is frustrating that best buy and more specifically amazon do not let the nsumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you re buying is a mini advertising billboard why uld not there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the low price is subsidized by all the ad on the device would this have changed my purchase absolutely i would have spent a uple buck more and probably got a samsung tablet
not a substitute for an ipad but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage
what can i say if you enjoy book and magazine it is hard to beat not backlit but not an issue for me i take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much
the fire tv fill my need for a streaming device i m able to access p vue netflix amazon prime and other channel apps the remote and interface are intuitive and simple and alexa is a nice add on feature much remmended for anyone looking for a streaming device
santa got this for my y o it work well on wi fi can link to our movie library via dma app add educational apps and can expand memory via sd card she cannot put it down much to our chagrin
it ha been a great product for our son easy to use and excellent for learning and playing game video quality is very good a well
we love this product and enjoy streaming movie and such
good one to nfigure everything ina easy way thanks
purchased for book reading but work well a a tablet wa not thinking that it would be a full replacement for my old ipad but working well a one
bought for my yr old they absolutely love it clear display and durable
if you can afford to get the hd version i would go for those however this is a great starter kindle love all the parent ntrols
i initially wanted to buy a kindle but uld not pa up the great deal and thought i uld exchange it if i changed my mind it work great and ha plenty of memory for what i needed which wa strictly to read i liked that i uld also watch netflix on it the only downside for me is that unlike the kindle i cannot read it in the sun but that is not that much of an innvenience so far overall i have been very happy with it
this is my the kindle and is well worth the price
echo ha a better than expected speaker that play music well hook it up to spotify through the alexa app and tell it what you want to hear
we bought this tablet for my four year old nephew and it work great we love how it can be set up for different user
got this to replace my son is cheaper tablet it is well worth the extra money he love it
very easy to use and i like the voice search the bluetooth headphone me in handy at night we get to enjoy all the feature with our prime acunt
i am amazed how much fun and help this is even great a a timer
it is everything i needed in a reader the light is perfectly balanced and the text is so easy on the eye and brain to read uld not be happier
it work great if you have a chance to get one i would remmend it
purchased for my wife so she can play game and not tie up her phone seems to play her game alright it is a bit slow when opening thing like the internet facebook or netflix still a decent little tablet for also limited to amazon app store so a lot of android apps are not available like dice with buddy
i would and have told people to get one if they have a k tv
i would not buy again had trouble w shutting off all the time we would have it reset back to the factory reset status and it would lock up and freeze actually replaced with send thinking that wa just a bad one however sad to report same problem not a favorite purchase
we actually bought these for our summer camp program and the kid love them they small enough for their hand to carry and they work like a charm the staff wa super helpful
i didnrealize what i wa missing until i bought one love this thing make being in my kitchen so much more pleasant because answer are right at my fingertip and i have access to so much music buying several a xmas present
this is a lot faster then the fire tv i have both and love the fire tv because how much faster it is
my grandson used my old i phone to play on got him this tablet and he love it great deal
this wa a christmas present for my niece she loved it
bought both the echo dot and the echo home the tech responds to mmands from everyone in the house including the kid but the echo search engine need a lot of work
this is an amazing tablet for the price i bought at christmas for the grand and one for me
it is a ton of fun we enjoy the ease of use our house is not automated so we do not get full use of it i do wish it used google instead of bing but it work
my only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps i use in my phone
his product is exactly what we thought it would be no mplaints
this amazon fire table is a great bargain it not a top of the line table and you cannotell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price doe a whole lot day to day regular use or just for kid and people that dont really care about some extra feature that flagship tablet bring it amazon
got it for my daughter and she love it and i love the child age range usage
i bought this for my wife is birthday present she absolutely love it it is easy to use easy on her eye and she prefers it to paper best present i have given her this year
my fiance really enjoyes it i would definitely remmend
there is no doubt that this is the best kindle device available the battery life is astonishing and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience it fit like a glove so what are the n you may ask for one the battery life depends on the provided case it act like a travel charger in a sense why a n well it limit your customization option and there is no way to purchase other lors or replacement for it at this time so you best be cautious with it and two the price obviously but if you take into acunt that you basically are given a premium case the device itself is a premium device and you have a traveling charge inside the case it may almost even out but a device is hard to justify when it is just for reading still would remmend to any fan of e reader reading
have the amazon fire stick and box the box is alot faster worth the price love it have of them
really a nice item work wonderfully for the st it is a bargain
bought for my daughter so far she is very pleased
this item is so great i love it i bought of this before and gave it to my family member and they loved it too

solid device that delivers on all advertised specification easy to use both with amazon and calibre
great for outdoors while seating in the sun reading
love the fire tv it is is fast and very responsive if you have amazon prime this is a must
i really like the kindle it so much easier to care around to read

great purchase good for entertainment and it talk
easy to set up and durable grandpa dropped it and no issue
it great
if you want a tap to make use of amazon is alexa voice service then dont get one the tap is a fine enough bluetooth speaker for wireless music but the need to touch a button for voice service render it far le valuable
great for family time hd is awesome great product
great product at a great price so glad i bought this
this is a great reader indoor or out no light to full light in landscape mode it fit my small hand just great battery life is excellent also i would remmend getting a soft ver to protect the book in transport

alexa is so amazing this is a wonderful new member of our family she is so smart and nstantly update her self now i would be lost without her
best e reader for now eye feel mfortable for reading
this product ha been so thoroughly reviewed that i wonrepeat the obvious in any detail it is great for reading under all nditions sharp typeface and of urse illuminated two small issue in dim light nditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven there are slightly darker area just above each of the four light that illuminate the screen this doe not bother me and it is not noticeable in a brightly lit environment more annoying is the fact that the search function doe not work with some book for those searching brings up no result no matter what i enter i have the same book on my kindle keyboard and have to use that to find what i m looking for i have not contacted amazon about this but it seems odd on other book it work a expected one other thing to keep in mind if you have an older kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently given that it is illuminated overall i like this reader a the display is excellent it is easy to hold and page turn and other navigation feature all work well if it were notfor the problem with searching i d give it five star
love the fact that you ask for a song and it play it almost instantly

my dauther love the tablet and i can get the sd to get more storage and load up all the disney movie that i purchased it is a great purchase
at first i thought it would be just another one of the voice interface that are on a lot of device it only me with a few function wow i never wa so happy to be proved wrong the omni directional microphone and excellent sound alone make it a great choice to add to your home because of it open source de you can add skill that other user have developed or download a sdk and make your own it read me bedtime story filter my ntent for news source acrding to my whim add mplex sum spell and is an all around good sport but the best thing is i had a few remote ntrol hub around wink nest the house because i hoped they would make my life easier only to find the they cell phone user interface made it much more cumbersome than mpleting the task myself echo changed all that it unified my security lock my light and more through an easy voice interface i uld not be more happy it gave me more than a smart house it gave me a smart home i even bought a send unit to take on vacation definitely will change your life for the better

great stuff for reading i have been taking it everywhere with me reading is never more simple
this work great if you use amazon a lot and watch movie from amazon
hey alexa hey alexa night and day it is hey alexa make the fire fix the breakfast wash the dish do the mopping ok so i have not figured out how to make alexa clean my house like cinderella yet but i m working on it in the meantime i have figured out that she is much more than a glorified alarm clock or dj although you should know that alarm are not currently supported on this device like they are on the echo this is a more basic version of alexa it doe not have her full functionality about mei m not sure what the target demographic for this product is but i am a professional female in my early thirty who is in a mmitted relationship that is a nice way of saying that my partying day are behind me and my boyfriend and i spend a lot of time binge watching stuff on the sofa yes we are suburban uch potato no shame here also i am an amazon prime member but do not have a k tv i used to have a roku that i used for netflix and hulu however i wa more interested in free shipping so i moved to prime and got a fire tv stick when it wa offered for for me the stick is a glorified hdml cable you uld get the same benefit by connecting your laptop to your tv it is le cumbersome but that is about it i wanted it because it said it uld mirror your device is screen onto your tv it didnexplain clearly enough that the only device it uld do that with wa a kindle although this ha since changed and can now be done that is why i didnorder the echo when it came out it sounded ol but i uld not figure out what it actually did since then my father got one for my mother who had a stroke and it is awesome read more
nice and mpact better than the older model
great price for a lot of fun this is my rd amazon fire great for game movie i installed kodi on it for extra programing and life tv i loved my amazon fire tv
great for toddler i remmend anyone to purchase a protective case
this product is the greatest thing not only is it a speaker but it is also a little mputer at the palm of your hand you can do so much with the echo that we are having so much fun talking to her there are little game you can play with her and she also ha a variety of other thing she can do if you are on the fence about getting an echo i would not hesitate and run to the closest best buy and pick it up now you will not regret it
this ha been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it
we bought this for our yr old daughter and it is great for most of what she doe but it is not good for playing a lot of game because it lock up sometimes or it run a little slower so if we had to do it again we d probably buy something with a bigger processor
it is a vert good item
buy this amazon box and side load kodi so you can get free tv box office movie and more google kodi and watch a video
alexa is a great product and i would highly remmend this product
since the fire tv stick wa announced i have heard a lot of people wonder if it wa something worth picking up essentially asking what doe this thing do that my tv doe not do already the answer is going to be different for different people but here is an easy way to think about it amazon fire tv stick is an excellent purchase if your tv is not a smart tv meaning your tv or dvd player did not me pre loaded with apps such a netflix youtube pandora etc your tv is a smart tv but apps do not perform well some smart tv have painful performance when streaming video apps can be difficult to update wifi connection can be spotty etc you want to access youtube netflix amazon prime pandora and other such apps on your tv you are an amazon prime member and want to access your prime video prime music and prime photo acunts you want to participate in casual gaming on your television you want to listen to music on your tv you want to have portability in other word television access to the above service while you are travelling amazon say the capability to use in hotel dorm etc with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is ming soon so the bottom line is that the fire tv stick allows you to access your movie music and photo a well a game and more via your television if your tv already doe these thing well or you re already doing them via other device such a a game nsole then this may not be worth your while so how easy is it to use i m telling you you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minute read more

the battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge i bought the fire in july and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it i am not impressed and would not repurchase it
i love it take a little getting use too alexa is very nice she your own personal assistant ask her anything but first u have to give her skill which are in the app

everyv in my home is running on this great technology reliability and ease of use amazon owns this market without a doubt had to move my appl tv to the loft needle to say
the kindle wa bought for my grandchild that also have ipads i do not have to worry so much about them breaking it and being out all the money for an ipad
the echo work well it wa easy to setup function a advertised very good response and reacts well to our voice good device
after setting up the amazon fire it froze on me and i had to return it
having not used android before i found this tablet very easy to use
needed speaker system for office music and the echo is very easy to set up syncing with my iphone by adding the alexa app took maybe minute from opening box to playing pandora on it have built in speaker in our house but they connect to cd player radio or cable music channel but i wanted something that i uld easily ntrol the genre and this is it
overall i think the heart is in an excellent product i am still learning how to make the most of it i need reading glass to read so if your like me you may want to nsider that
more positive than negative on this one battery is great readability is great the backlight make low light reading super the only thing that would make this even better would be water resistance
love it easy to navigate even my toddler can do it
the parental option need some work you cannot even log in to a child acunt until you have apps loaded for them to use also a kid is login doe not have access to pre loaded apps like the calculator seems really odd to me that you cannot give them access to basic functionality of the tablet otherwise the tablet itself work great
i bought two of the amazon fire tablet for my year old and i have had no problem with them they do not have some of the game that you can download on an android market but other then that the tablet overall are great especially for kid sense they have a child is browsing adult browsing with parental lock

k quad re gb ram usb and microsd voice remote this box is a monster bonus if you are part of the amazon prime world if not still get one it run circle around appletv plus these can be modded if you are savvy enough
the good great for music playing and lighting ntrol if you have bought hue light or smart switch i have the wemo switch and they work pretty wellgreat for some ntrol of amazon is fire stick tv ok at answering general question but not amazing alexa is often stumped still it is pretty ol to speak and have your house react around you

my younger grandson love this it go wherever he go
it is great i cannot imagine life without it i love the built in dictionary
i got the amazon echo and the dot to supplement it although they say that the echo can hear from all over it really cannot it depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are ie television or stereo on or even if the echo is playing loud music itself so i got the dot for my bedroom and it work just fine it is a little mplicated to setup to the wifi but once i figured it out i needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone it worked like a charm after the echo is connected to the wifi you cannoturn the automatic wifi back onto your phone i m just getting started to using it with my smart home automation so far i cannoturn on off dim my light in my living room with just my voice love it once i get more bulb for my bedroom and hallway i ll add those too it just get expensive at per bulb also i wish you uld re name call it something other than alexa amazon or echo nothing personal but it doe not make sense since there is a box to enter the name so for now she is alexa
perfect for anyone who love to watch any type of movie always available at anytime
i purchased this for my mother a a gift because she wa always watching me play game surf the internet check my email and message friend she asked if the one she had uld do all that and i new it would not she love her new fire

love the choice of lors have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift
i believe it uld be a little faster screen is not very tough broke in a few month
i or a family member have owned every version of the kindle since it came out this version ha finally taken all of the best element of the previous kindles and mbined them into one unit it is small and light ha both touch screen and button functionality depending on which you prefer i m a fan of the button and an excellent back light kindle battery life ha always been excellent and is no different here i use my kindle daily often for at least an hour at a time the only downside is that i m not sure what other feature amazon uld add to improve this version other than perhaps making it lighter weight by far the best e reader out there and a worthy upgrade from a previous version
i m very glad having this with me in my untry there are lot of book in spanish that i m not able to get so this wa perfect solution it is incredible how similar to paper is battery super long
my only ncern is that after only having the kindle open and useable is that it tends to freeze up otherwise this it is a great tablet to have
bought a a gift for mom i have seen one before nothing spectacular but they work fixed a screen for a friend last year it took maybe minute so that is a plus
amazon kindle pleased my lady she is very happy with the kindle and with the gsp added im not worried about it crabbing out either

echo is fun to have but doe not offer all i thought it would difficult to get answer to simple question
i wanted a kindle that i uld use to view movie on when traveling and this item wa the perfect choice it is my go to device

a always great job very easy to use and it is always with me only problem i have is the button on the bottom is touchy but not really an issue keep up the good work
like the function a a prime member easy access to prime movie book etc it a tad slow and every time you turn it on or unlock there an ad oh well
young kid love it easy to use and take a beating but still cheap enough that if it doe happen to break you do not break the bank too
this is the best e reader on market i have had previous one but love that i can adjust brightness for night time reading without killing my eye on a tablet
i had purchased an apple tv most recent generation and hated it the touch screen wa too touchy and ultimately it just never functioned properly so i returned it to st instead i bought this product because it had all of the online channel except apple tv but who care and it ha alexa which frankly is better than siri and i say that despite being very pro apple
have heard so much about echo i had to try it out setting up with my router wa a little hard but finally got it and when disnects again it back up on it own nice to ask about weather or what ever and not have to grab my phone need to get prime music acunt so can listen to any or all music on there but for now really happy glad i got it good price too
purchased two of these tablet both of them had dead pixel all over the screen read a lot of online review which stated same problem the screen resolution is pretty bad but what can you expect for

work just like it say it doe would remend this to anybody

outstanding item to have and own when family and friend are visiting
i do like the camera sorry that is all i have to say
it wa everything we expected it wa smaller and brighter than our previous kindle

pretty good work great and is very easy to install
amazon fire tv is so easy to use and it a great way to watch everything you want
the kindle voyage is always with my in my purse it is light mpact and easy to hold i still love hard ver book but now i do not have to carry around the book from my book club some of the book i would rather not have to keep up with anyway and i can jump back and forth between story
great product i bought both the fire tv and the fire stick the stick is going back and i m going to buy more of these for the rest of the house
everyone need to stop reading review and go out and buy the echo i used to ask myself the most random thing what is half of do alien exist and how tall is khloe kardashian well no more awkward silence to my own question alexa ha been a massive help in answering my question alexa ha made my life so much easier and i do not even have to push any button alexa is a mputer and not a human so you have to ask alexa question a if you were typing it in google but you have to say alexa followed by your question definitely some kink to work out but a a gen product the amazon echo is awesome literally stop reading this review and just purchase it
my daughter love her new kindle it ha all of her favorite game i love the parental ntrols of the kindle fire v standard android tablet
picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone it is small enough i can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind
purchased this tablet for a yr old and it is perfect easy to use and very durable he is very happy
great tablet for kid le than half the price of an ipad
installation wa quick and i wa watching in no time love the voice search and alexa integration amazon integration is perfect unfortunately the voice search only search amazon video and not netflix like the roku for k this device support fps and the roku support fps i do not know if that is a big deal yet or not until i get my k tv i bought this because of the price point and i already had two roku stick i also found that amazon doe not support certain movie on certain device i e i uld not stream apocalypse now or full metal jacket on the roku stick but it wa available on the p you have to look at supported device in each movie to determine when i started mmenting on it in the amazon forum they all of a sudden showed up
i read a lot check email and shop that is all i want and need from a tablet and this one is awesome
quite simple it is a kindle fire tablet it doe exactly what it should do a a tablet attached to a reader i like that i can send thing from my desktop to my kindle it stream well and it work well with my bluetooth keyboard this is actually what nvinced me to do a year of prime next year we ll see how it go if i renew but so far so good the lock screen show a different advert but that is not so bad it is only a lock screen
fine for child but a bit difficult to handle with the apps
great for the person who love technology and the sound of their own voice mmand price is right too
first and foremost the echo is a good bluetooth connected speaker it is no sonos but i wa not expecting it to be it is really ol to ask her question like you would a real person and get some good result when is the cub game how are they doing and what are show time for star trek beyond yielded great result to be honest though that novelty while very good and nsistent wear off a little i would not remmend this to anyone who ha not invested in smart home tech because that is where the echo shine i currently have an ebee phillips hue sonos august lock and harmony hub right now the echo work with hue sonos and ebee with the harmony hub being tested currently there is no way to make the august work but there are way to make other thing work using apps like iftt and yonomi i suggest anyone who want one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing thing you can do with this awesome little device i cannoturn on and off my light turn on and off my different activity with harmony play music lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web it is really ol and we are closer to star trek than ever it is worth the money if you want to talk to your house i love it there are some failing it doe not understand some mplex wordy question while others it ha no problem with the list of mpatible device are limited but with those two apps i spoke of iftt and yonomi that list is greatly increased and the skill you can get are not good at all limited and poor but the potential is there and it look like amazon is working on it
this tablet is simple to set up and it is worth the price it is perfect for beginner
got this a a birthday gift fun for the whole family
perfect simple device for reading ebooks doe exactly what you d expect it to do hold a charge for a really long time easy to use and set up light and nvenient for reading on the go
bought the original kindle fire and wa impressed with the latest updated version better software camera and more apps make this all the more worth the small price i guess that amazon take a loss on the production of this unit to gain your interest in buying their merchandise and using their service in any case it work and i would remmend this to anyone interested in an inexpensive internet access device
the dot doe everything this doe and most people already have blue tooth speaker to hook up to it
great tablet for my kid not a many feature a an ipad but also of the price

bought a kindle fire for my wife several year ago our son is now and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife so we decided he wa responsible enough and bought this for him for christmas i cannot believe the improvement over the previous kindle fire we own the screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed apps load faster it connects to the internet faster for the they currently sell for i would say it is an excellent value if you can wait we paid le at christmas so a lower price uld be seen again
the amazon echo is a very easy device to use it make it easy to ntrol all of your smart device like music on your mputer cell phone smart tv is light bulb and many other device all you do is tell it what to do and it doe the rest
the voyage is worth the extra money it is a wonderful device very responsive and easy to use i would highly remmend
i already had two dot one connected to my main stereo via the aux line but i wanted a stand alone alexa device for a large bathroom suite no real mplaints other than value i think this should be more like a device the speaker quality is pretty good but i expected something closer to a high end stand alone bluetooth speaker for still i do not regret the purchase and i would make it again one other factor that didnaffect the way i am using it unlike the dot the echo cannot be used with earbuds because it doe not have bluethooth sending capability
product is very intuitive and easy to use work well with the phillips light system
bought this a a gift so i do not know much about it seems nice though
my daughter love it so much and she love caring it around with her
fun and easy to use must be very specfic when asking question music not a good a music played on sirius ha good sound and can hear you speak from across the room i would buy again and remmend to a friend
the amazon echo work well so well in fact that i have not felt the need to use the remote very often however there are a few occasion when it is great when listening to music getting the volume just right using voice mmands can get annoying the remote is quick easy and allows greater fine tuning when there is a lot of background noise the echo is good but sometimes ha difficulty hearing rrectly when i have my kitchen fan on or there is a lot of other background noise speaking into the remote never fails and also doe not require you to say the wake word when in another room i often listen to music on my echo even when in another room yelling across the house is disturbing and doe not always work but the remote allows me to skip pause or turn off the music from my office or bedroom it is also great for adding item to the shopping and to do list if i lost my remote or more likely dropped it in the kitchen sink i d buy another without hesitation
the echo is a great product to play hard to find music and keep you updated on weather current event and trivia information
have enjoyed using the touch screen to operate the page light adjustment ha been very useful especially when reading in bed with my wife sleeping
this product should get product of the year award it is the most amazing piece of technology i have purchased this year it can ntrol your schedule play music from pandora and i heart radio ntrolled the light in my home turned the tv on and off with voice mmands so far i have not seen anything else quite like this it is absolutely amazing
wa a gift for year old a far a i know they like them
this is bleeding edge technology it is not a google search but with new skill being added all the time it is a great way to use technology
this is actually my send kindle a i left on a trip and forgot mine at home and i didnwant to be without it the paper white wihich can be used outside in the glaring sun make it a huge winner for me
my daughter had been asking for a tablet she loved it and since like to watch movie and play game and take a bunch of picture i like that you can expand the memory up to gig
this is awesome for reading much better to read than my ipad mini the refresh from page to page or when you set a bookmark is more annoying than using the kindle app on the ipad mini but for reading book it is easy on my eye and it cannot be beat i read in bed before going to sleep and i can fall asleep easier after using my kindle than the ipad
the fire tablet allows you to get a lot of free apps it run fast even with the amount of apps you have on there
this tablet is a good for small child it ha a good ver
we got this for my son to use a a reader and also do audio book with read along it ha been great he had a laptop but that is too large to be practical this work perfectly for him
my grandchild are home schooled and utilize the table for many learning apps they love using them a it make them feel so grown up the tablet are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefit from them
used it for watching television show the picture wa clear and the audio wa decent for the location of the speaker
i think everyone know by now that this is a must have item if you find it on sale and do not already have one then you should probably buy it it is a great product
cannot connect to bluetooth for this price it is a nice item

work well and i would highly remmend this product
this product is excellent would remmend to other people keep all my stuff in on unit
i have more fun with this thing i m much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news because alexia is nstantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go there is no pairing required so i simply call out her name and she responds there is always a battle between me and my teenager trying to outshout alexa instruction so we can hear the music that we like best
minimum setup required glossary of term is somewhat limited design is attractive and fit into any dã r sound is good not bose but acceptable easy to add feature calendar to do list reminder etc
you cannot beat the price this is the best tabet under easy to upgrade from one amazon tablet to another a long a you have an amazon acunt and back up your information
this is amazon cheapest tablet and probably oldest in the market good for the price

my wife went on a cruise and when she came back found out she wa replaced by alexa just kidding great sound for music help kid with homework make grocery list weather and traffic lot it can do i got it for on a surprise day sale thru best buy

great product just uld not get my international chanels
i got it to store all my llege book without checking to see if they would even be mpatible they were notit is my fault for not checking this the three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for le and use the kindle app which is what i did i can now read my book and have a fully functional tablet
the kindle amazon fire hd tablet is not a high priced item but it is everything i want from a tablet easy to use easy to read and easy to pay for a great tablet
the fact that it ha parental ntrol so i can verify what they are downloading is great
better loading longer battery life clearer picture more space still just a durable

i received this a a birthday gift and i love it the auto brightness is amazing the battery life is incredible and the page turning feature is very useful my only mplaints are that it doe not mpletely turn off because it display ad instead of showing a blank screen and that the sorting and navigation uld be more organized other than those two thing which are a minor to a whole this product is wonderful
good deal i remmended this tablet to several family member
nice and lightweight the screen is easy to read i do not like that half the screen on the menu page is taken up by promos instead of my library
look at this product a a portable speaker first and an echo replacement send the big reason to buy this over standard bluetooth speaker is this ha wifi streaming enabled when you are at home you can stream music with ease to it voice regnition is top notch and it really shine when using it with other smart home accessory the only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice if you want bigger sound and always listening feature spend the extra money on the amazon echo
i got this to replace a sony reader cannot get book for it anymore that is all i really wanted it for but i have played around with it to go on line or check e mail pretty easy to use but it me with next to no instruction if anything it me preloaded with too much stuff but they are all freebie so i do not care i like being able to adjust the type face size turning the page with a flick of my finger and always ming back to where i am in my book if i put the system to sleep it ha a back lit screen so i can read in bed or in the dark even without disturbing my husband i m very happy with it

i bought this to replace a fire hd tablet that broke amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out i set this up for my son with special need i tried to make it a simple a possible for him it is a little bigger the sound is not a good a the previous fire tablet it also seems very slippery i got a rubber honeymb type ver for it that seems to help u to grip it better over all it is a good tablet for a child just use parental ntrols and get a good ver for it
excellent in all light nditions easy to use just what wa required
used with playstation vue this box rock it is fast plus when fast forwarding to skip mmercials you actually get to see what rresponds to the timeline unlike the roku streaming stick which only show the current image plus how many minute ahead or back you can go not the image just the increment with the fire tv you actually see the exact minute and send on the timeline along with the image at that time plus fire tv let you fast forward up to x actual speed
i love the box lot of feature can use on any tv home and vacation
set up wa easy plug it in turn on the tv learning what channel i can see or not see is a learning curve so far i am liking it but have to adjust to the change moving away from cable
this unit work great we ditched cable and this is a great alternative we have had no problem with this unit
i can make a grocery list request my favorite song turn my light on off all with my amazon echo
i bought this fire tv month ago one day out of the blue it stopped working power is on but a soon after i see the amazon logo the screen go black i google the problem and it seems that the only way to reset it to the factory mode is by the on screen menu so there is no way for me to do it i just emailed the mpany and waiting for a response since it is unacceptable that this thing only lasted month before it became useless not a happy camper here
we love our echo music news and basic info it is great
we got the alexa on sale for my wife enjoys putting music on whenever she want i enjoy the information i can get
if you are looking for a tablet to read book play game watch netflix or amazon and to travel with look no further this tablet ha everything you need it doe not have the greatest camera but you have a phone for that no reason to spend more money on anything else
so much more screen size than previously kindles fast charging longer battery life
it is not bad for the novelty of alexa might a well get the echo sound it not bad and i m no audiophile might be good when my echo dot me in is it worth it there are better bluetooth speaker out there
i wa looking for a table that felt right for my child love to read book they already have an app for book and we can browse easily
a great place to start in tablet market good value
i have been very satisfied with my new kindle and use it almost every day
i would highly remmend this item great home speaker play anything you ask also give you weather info and about anything else you want to know
you never feel alone when alexa is around she is like another member of the family
ol little device that tell you almost anything you want to know music sound good a well
had high expectation alexa cannot answer many of my question setting up music hard a heck
i bought this for my niece and she love it we take it everywhere
i bought this device to use with child in my therapy practice it is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it it took over and set up thing with amazon i did not approve such a charging my acunt and registering me with prime before i uld figure out the setting the picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photo are very pixelated
at first wa not so sure about getting the echo finally after reading review and the thing it uld do i bought one so far it ha worked great and looking forward to being able to ntinue to expand it capability and help smart wire my house
somewhat substandard ipads are certainly better but it get the job done for
i wa impressed how clear the word on the screen are
this is my favorite set top box you have all the same function a the others but you can also side load apps a well such a kodi and emulator to play old school game like super mario and zelda if you have amazon prime the alexa feature is pretty awesome a well finding music on prime and getting random information
tablet is nice and light and durable great for my nreices and nephew
great budget tablet just need good sized microsd card
this is just the right size for someone who doe not want to always use their phone while on the go must have wifi but that is not a problem the response to the touch is not bad at all it is not an ipad but it doe the job fo rmusic book youtube facebook and other small application

this amazon tv wa very easy to set up i really enjoy all the feature that it ha to offer i find myself not watching cable tv a much because now i can pick and choose the type of program i prefer to watch the problem with cable tv other than the outrage high price is that you are paying for channel that you never watch
i love my new amazon fire i wa very easy to use
easy to install just requires internet connection if you have an amazon prime acunt you have access to all kind of movie and show like a hulu or netflix acunt would work there are also apps that you can download and purchase that will alllow you to watch other show and even play game since installing the firestick we have gotten rid of one cable box because we can just watch so many other thing on the firestick and have helped cut down on our bill who doe not like saving money
i wish i had purchased this a earlier fun for the whole family
thanks child are help but changed do not work good
excellent product fast shipping for electronics bestbuy is number one
so happy with this kindle it is very easy to use lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book except here you have an entire library with you

so far fire tv ha been just what i expected work well give me what i wanted
this kindle is much lighter than my old nd generation kindle the ad are no problem at all a they only appear when the kindle is in sleep mode the back light is great so is the price
k on fire if you want a k streaming with amazon
i am very happy with my fire tv it is make me want to buy another to go in my son is room
i wa truly happy with the product however i also purchased gift card each tablet since i wa not sure a to what brand to purchase one of your sell staff advised me that i should purchase google play gift card which i did to my surprise on christmas morning my grand child were not able to use them because a your staff should have known they are not mpatible i took them to the store to exchange them and i learned that not only that best buy would not exchange refund them but that you do not carry the amazon card you have just last a good customer when it me to purchasing some item that i can purchase online at amazon or another store i purchased an hp pc and a apple ipad at another store just to make a point i wa and still are very disappointed with your sale staff and your sell practice i will remmend the table to a friend but stay way from asking assistance when purchasing the right gift card
the echo is a gateway drug first i just wanted a bluetooth speaker with some novelty feature then i got smart outlet then hue light now i m looking at smart lock beware
purchased to replace the one i bought for my brother in august physical damage this time bought the extended warranty no issue or claim so far
great product i have two of these and a uple of the pod is these are great for listening to music solid built in speaker and the pod with bose bluetooth speaker is only a slight improvement i m already buying two more of these for christmas gift
great tablet for beginner especially with wifi function and ebook purpose
alexa is handy but doe not always work we have two light outside and sometimes both with turn on or off when mmanded and sometimes only one will turn on or off
wish tablet wa voice capable only problem wa how long it took for the merrillville in store to restock they ran out at christmas it took about month before they were available again
this is the best streaming device i have purchased yet hook to ethernet and is lightning fast
this is a great price point for this tablet i bought of them for my family to use to supplement their iphones youtube and netflix are easier to watch on the tablet is larger screen
work great with a k tv better quality than my other streaming device
fast and easy to use i watch prime movie on it and also play game on it also best part you can add apps to it
i bought this for my grandkids it is easy to use and they love it
the wide wide world of tv at your finger tip we love this
still feeling my way but if i have any more question will check with the geek squad
so at first i wa not sold on this i bought it mainly to act a voice ntrol for my lutron light on our first floor and i already had pi remote throughout so it didnget used that much then it kind of clicked with some simple thing like setting timer and playing podcast then it got more natural when i connected the alexa app and the logitech harmony app with ifttt next thing you know my wife and my son are both using it a we re ming and going to turn the light off and on turning on the tv turning off when it is time for dinner etc etc really excited for the upming sonos integration all in all this wa a very worthwhile purchase a it is beme a really strong platform for home automation and it only look like it is going to get better i think it is safe to say that the echo mean different thing to different people if you re into ha then do not hesitate
great for streaming kodi and much faster than firestick
always ntent with best buy and their product i would definitely remmend
i wa using a kindle paperwhite and when i saw this on sale for black friday i figure why not i have been very pleased so far
i enjoy using this product but doe not get a many apps and game a the android
debated between firetv and apple tv and ultimately went with firetv due to price work great easy set up and easy navigation i have not had any buffering issue
i purchased the amazon fire tablet because i have had one for about or year i wanted a tablet that wa sturdy and would last because i purchased it for of my grandchild
bought this for my daughter and she u it all the time i highly remmend it dd
the product wa just what i wa looking for got it on sale made it a deal i uld not pa on enjoy having alexa in the living room
work very well video quality is very good it is easy to navigate
i like the definition but the software ha bug i had to return mine
a real neat gadget that really work great tool for the kitchen too
much better interface than roku love the k feature
i like my amazon echo because it cannotie in with my nest thermostat and i can ntrol the temperature both at my house and at my store with a simple voice mmand i also like asking alexa random question to see what she know i like the fact that she learns more the longer you have her there are some thing that it seems like she should know but doe not yet i know she is still learning heck so am i
this is a great streaming box and i enjoy the voice search option however i wish that the amazon fire tv when doing a search on the main screen would provide you the option of a movie or tv show from apps that you have a subscription with and not just amazon of urse i can go into each and every app that i have a paid subscription with but it would be nice to do a search from the main screen and display result across the board
my kid love asking random question and it is been alot of fun
wa looking at some more expensive android tablet to replace a year old device and saw this one on sale despite the relatively much lower price i wa originally very worried that the amazon app esystem wa going to be sorely lacking mpared to the full google play catalog but it turn out that while it is missing some important apps not just game but productivity apps too the more than adequate spec good enough screen gb of ram decent processor are enough for of what i need from a tablet and if you can get it on sale you cannot go wrong lastly if you re deciding between the and this fire splurge a little bit and get this one instead
i needed a tablet to use in a classroom setting and the amazon fire worked great
great tablet for the price however the battery drain quickly
it is good for the low st good one to gift doe the basic job
the old one would not hold a charge but my new one go day before running out of juice
great product would remmend to a friend love it love it love it
better than i expected alexa is my new best friend
plugged it in connected to wifi and wa ready to roll k capability and p better than cable box
i have been using the amazon echo for a few week now i have to say it much more responsive then the google home when using home automation a must have for any home
we purchased of these for our child they find them easy to use
uld not go wrong with the amazon tablet for best deal there is only at best buy
my year old love his tablet he know how to utilize it very well it need a better camera
i purchased this table for my year old mom and she wa able to navigate with little assistance
this is a great little system for listening to music and simple mmands
alexa is very responsive to question request and play music also work a an alarm clock and play game
it really amazing device i really like it it working flow le
i just use this to watch hulu and amazonprime video and hbo the one mplaint i have is that there is no hdmi output so when i travel i cannot hook it up to the hotel tv to watch
it is a near a the public can enjoy towards artificial intelligence
these kindle fire tablet simply cannot be beat in term of value and bang for your buck if you have an amazon prime acunt it would be a crime not to have a fire tablet good strong build quality very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution they are pretty responsive have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kid use it a well
i love everything about this reader the book advertising on the lock screen is so ol in my house it such a small thing but it make u smile every time i do think it kinda weird that it flicker sometimes but after watching product video i see that it not abnormal maybe if i looked it up i d understand but it not bothersome enough to do so overall i would buy this item again no question asked
once set up is mpleted it is very easy to use many option available i wa able to link my iphone to echo and it ha made my experience much more enjoyable
i purchased this for my yr old who love reading but also love the apps and game available this ha a fast load time and i remmend a sd card to go with it we needed it after a few day of downloading book and apps
i m not normally a techie person but i read so many positive thing about amazon is echo and alexa i splurged and gave it a try i absolutely love it of urse asking question about traffic weather recipe etc can be a blast but i have to admit that my favorite part is being able to request any type of music i m in the mood for and even change my mind a few minute later without having to sort through cd is or putz around with the various play or radio station on my phone or laptop definitely a gadget worth the money
bought for my yr old a a christmas present i turned it on and set it up pretty sure she will love it
salesperson did a good job remmending this item after we explained what we would use it for
not really much to say here but it doe the job i m not use to the amazon store a i am with the google store but i can live with it this wa a spur of the moment but where i wanted something to take on the plane and not spend a lot and so far it ha been my traveling buddy for the price it is good and doe what it should without to many mpromises ad if your not looking for a lot nice stop
bought it for myself and then bought two more for my kid they approved it
i bought this for my niece and nephew and they love it
echo is a great product wish it had better understanding i find myself having to repeat often but other than that i love it great product

i love this thing work great with wifi enabled smart home product
great for all round entertainment i connected it to my amazon acunt and even my phone so o uld view my picture on the tv i unfortunately had to return it because one of the purpose for which i bought it wa not fulfiled

my yo mother love to be able to adjust lighting level with voice mmands through integration with philip hue device and my yo dad laugh every time alexa doe a she is told and say ok
good basic tablet for checking email web browsing and reading ebooks
is very easy to operate bought a an extra for when grandchild visit because i love to use mine to read and uld not if they wanted to play with my reader
fantastic price large amount of app to choose from good parental ntrols helpful technical support of urse do not expect this tablet to not getting slow when multiple apps are running in the background
i would remmend to others great playing game reading surfing the internet camera work very good and easy upload photo when needed
fun for the kid to play with in their spare time
i love alexa she can make me laugh keep up with my grocery list play lullaby for my baby and minion song for my toddler her weather forcasts are awesome the only thing i wish she knew a well is how to speak other language if you ask her she say she only speaks english right now but is always learning so i cant wait until that update happens so ol
i love this kindle work great for me i will be ordering another one today for my wife
i like alexa but limited cannot connect with i tune acunt yet can only set a one time alarm with hour and cannot make it recurring i see improvement weekly but still a long way to go
i am enjoying it so far great for reading had the original fire since the fire used to make my eye hurt if i read too long have not experienced that with the paperwhite yet
i love the size and portability of this keep me in touch and having fun

i like the product work vey well and i am very happy with it
i love my new amazon fire tablet it so easy to use and stay charged for a nice amount of time
i didnknow how well he would do with a full blown tablet but i am shocked at how well he navigates it on his own he doe get stuck from time to time but a few time and key word and he can pull up apps close them pause and play movie etc by himself his vocal skill have improved and he is saying and identifying letter and it ha to be because of the tablet i m impressed at how well it hold his attention his letter understanding he is ha transferred off screen to the physical material we use plus it is a great motivation tool i love it and he doe too
i love the tablet everything work perfect for my boy
bought this tablet for a relative for christmas who wanted access to audiobooks my only issue is that the tablet need a wifi connection in order for the audio to work with certain apps not a problem if you have nstant access to wifi but my relative doe not nice tablet otherwise
the fire box is very well made work great with amazon prime video and kodi the only mplaint i have is the remote doe not have a on or off button you have to buy a separate attachment for that
you get what you pay for with this product there are better tablet but this is a wonderful product for the low price
year old son u with ease older son already had a kindle and i also own on very good product
i got this on black friday for even at the regular price of it is a steal it is a basic tablet that will download apps and go on the internet while the internet browser is not that great it is mparable to a phone system which sts a lot more
love that it is interactive a long a i m connected to the wifi or via bluetooth to my phone the sound is pretty good tends to get a little tinny sounding if you turn it up too loud but overall a good sound i m still trying to find alexa is limit on what she can and cannot do
my son wa excited to get this and it kept closing on him returned it but they do not have any in stock to exchange frustrated and my son is upset
i brought this product and love it it is much faster than the fire stick and work great wit my home automation
for a tablet good price and function wa tired of working a lot on smart phone this is a good substitute will even order book
it is light and easy to carry i can read book everywhere now
i received this a a christmas gift i wa excited about this new product and downloaded the alexa app i am not an amazon prime member and i did not joined the free trial i asked question to my alexa and it usually did not provide any answer or uld not understand my question despite giving simple mmands the device look good and the led light on top that turn on when you speak to it is great sound is good for music however i did not feel that it wa a good assistant i did not like that you have to download skill to make alexa have more function you always had to speak alexa and then ask the skill you downloaded it then get to a point that you do not even remember what skill you downloaded so you always had to look at your phone or mobile device to see what you had i exchanged it for the google home and it ha been a better device it play music from google music and not only music that you have purchased it answer a lot of question and give you great news briefing instead of downloading the particular skill it also provides more answer to question and i wa surprise by the detail of the answer at time i highly remmend to google home device i have not tested it with chromecast smart tv or with smart home appliance such a nest etc
the amazon echo ha very good voice regnition it work just a advertised and is quick with the response i wa glad to see it at best buy so i uld touch it and try it before i bought it the setup wa easy and quick
the product is easy to understand and use if you have already viewed a series from plex hulu or another provider the remote will take you to where you left off if you want to view something from amazon prime you press the button and speak the name and it find it for you
this is a great product at a great price they will make great first time tablet for kid
my family love our amazon echo and alexa she is used mostly for playing just about any song available a well a weather report creating shopping and todo list and learning bit of trivia too
this tablet wa affordable and it is pretty decent
this wa a gift for my boyfriend he usually ha apple product but i bought him this tablet and he love it it is easy to watch his video browse the web and even download book
the echo is pretty great news in a snap and music at your fingertip get most voice prompt accurately even when my kid are yelling different thing at her at the same time and she never loses her temper
my kid love their new kindle fire no issue and we bought these in august highly remmend
this wa purchased for a nd tv no issue love it
i have had other kindles and when my current one storage became low i knew i wanted to purchase another one it can be used for a variety of u
full disclosure i have only had ipads in the past i needed an android based tablet a a rd party app that i needed wa yet io supported you get what you pay for build quality touch and feel yes it is equal to the price nstant add urging you to make various amazon based purchase not my cup of tea but i guess fill a price point and need
although this wonbe mpeting with the ipad or some higher end android tablet this easily outperforms any other tablet in this price range i also love the fact that although this is made of plastic it ha a unibody design and great build quality not flimsy like many other tablet at this price
i love my echo and have gotten more for family best thing ever
battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good alexa is not a smart a the marketing would like you to think i get a lot of i do not know the answer to that
just got the echo last month and i just love it i plan on getting another one soon and would remmend it to anyone
love this product work great so far i would remmend this to others
before buying the firetv i had the firetv stick in an effort to cancel my cable i signed up for playstation vue vue worked on the firetv stick and got the job done but when a sale came for the firetv i thought why not boy night and day difference in speed of menu transition and buffering of show everything is just snappier and faster going back to a firetv stick wa so painful because of the lag in menu transition if you uld afford it go for the firetv over the stick also i own a roku and the firetv is much more useful because of the ability to sideload apps
initially bought the amazon echo dot liked it it wa fun and entertaining sound wa not bad for a small unit but upgraded to echo touch sound wa much better quality then upped it again to echo we gave our dot to our daughter but kept the echo touch to pair it the echo so we can hear same music in multiple room or living room and one outside patio etc work great that way we also have the bose wifi and sound link mini cannot beat bose sound but they need to address some technical issue i e cannot pair those two together yuh really
love amazon however their tablet limit you to using their browser and their apps go online and you can get around them and download google and the playstore made my fire into regular android tablet much happier now
this tablet is a good size for year old for their first one after i bought and downloaded a few aps i realized that i should have gotten the tablet with more memory otherwise a good product the table ver is a must to protect tablet

i purchased the kindle fire for my mom a a mother day present and she love it
software can be clunky to navigate certain apps are not available at this time for amazon fire tv only saving grace is my subscription to playstation vue

the kindle ntinues to freeze up when watching a movie it will also freeze randomly
bought on black friday for add a trifold case portable tv while i do dish ok anything
i didnsee that much of an improvement from the fire stick so i do not think it worth the extra cash decided to go with fire stick to save a bit
amazon make such a good ereader that no other mpany even try to make one there are very few product in the world where that is true the paperwhite is worth the extra money for the lighting
i got a great price on this item it wa a gift and my mom love it easy to start using on day

knowledgeable urtesy out of way helpful professional
nice reader good screen easy to use and the camera is a nice bonus

i bought the product a a gift for a family member who wa able to set uo and start using the product with minimal or no instruction this is so important for those who might be le mputer savvy
i love this it is very good to have it different
work a lot better than the fire stick love that there is an sd card slot
for the price it is tough to mplain but it doe occasionally stutter or get slow down overall you cannot find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money i would use it for the new fire hd instead
clear screen lor and size grandson love to play game on it and i like to have it with me to view email during mmercials while watching tv
my daughter is google tablet had run it urse so i purchased this i miss the simplicity of android
i just use it a a new phone charger for my android you need to buy this if you buy a kindle because the usb they me with doe not have this attached
mpared to the rest this is amazing especially the price
ha many educational apps i would definitely go into the setting if you re a mother like me who is a very strict of what your child watch on tv or what game and apps they download i would definitely remmend setting the parental ntrols before giving it to them in my personal opinion a a mother i feel it help by setting the restriction ntent on it help keep their mind away from the gutter bcuz most apps and internet website have inappropriate site child should not be watching we cannot ntrol what they put on the internet but we can ntrol what our child watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps read book most of these apps are free to i also remmend not putting a payment method option other than that my kid loved it
gave a a gift along with the ver person seemed to like it
this thing is awesome next best thing to having cable the tv show and movie ntent is great with the download of kodi app i would highly remmend this to anyone it even ha the built in alexa which can give you local weather traffic report etc
easy hook up no fuse no hassle just plane easy play music nice and loud the speaker are nice no distortion i enjoy it very must im glade i purchase this item
purchased this for my wife so she can read in bed at night without disturbing me while i try to sleep because of it design it is more like a book with adjustable lighting font and shading she absolutely love it
this is a very solid device for under the screen quality is great and performance is hard to beat for most typical use i needed more power to run some very intense apps like litchi for ntrolling a dji mavic so if you are looking for a powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast gb ram
take a while to get used to talking to an inanimate object lot of third party apps
we have an ipad but bought this for the kid unlimited prime ntent we have enjoyed it and it ha a lot that the ipad doe not the menu uld be more friendly but i like the parental limit it ha
i enjoy using this kindle fire the apps are easy to install the screen is a great size i can even use it without my glass

i have to get a case for him but i wa able to set this one up for free time i have it set for time frame of the week and weekend he can play i also wa able to make it where he cannot play game until he ha mpleted min of reading
such a very good tablet with great apps and very easy to use bought for an year old grandson who is very happy with it
lot of fun but also very useful have it connected to my nest thermostat and going to connect it to my casta wireless switch the speaker ha great bass for it size search youtube video for tip and trick it doe more then you think
brought this from qvc due to value payment i love it i use it to listen to the radio yes you can listen to radio station local from all over the untry by using one of the free apps i get my weather movie time tell is me where a zip de or area de is turn my light on off i can order thing from amazon check my capitol one credit card balance even pay on it etc what more can a lazy person ask for

easy to set up play movie from amazon prime with no problem great tablet for the price
i have been and apple tv guy from the start but wa disappointed they chose not to include k on there latest model so i thought i would see what amazon had to offer wow the k ntent available is awesome and growing everyday all the menu is are easy to use and set up very very happy with this purchase
love these so much we now have echo kitchen living room basement and outdoor area and dot for bedroom now that they can play everywhere together it is great going from one room to another with music playing in all room when we are entertaining highly remmend
this is the best kindle ereader yet the size and weight make it perfect for mfortable reading you will find yourself reading more book than ever with it
wa easy to set up easy to use somethings are limited like music unless you have a prime acunt like music however i did find out you can use pandora or music saved on your phone overall a great product still learning new stuff everyday
i thought this would be a fun toy to have around but it ha beme much more i have a home automation system in my home and i ntiniasly need to find my ntrol panel or bust out my phone which to be honest is somewhat fustrating via alexa i wa able to ntrol everything in my home including my nest which is awesome only drawback is price it somewhat pricy for what it is
many feature packed into a low price good a an ereader or light tablet u to surf internet email and game easy to use memory is expandable too
easy to use and navigate purchasing book is fast and simple and i love the fact that i can password protect this device
i have not used it a lot yet but the few time i did it work great it wa easy to set up looking forward to be able to bring this with u on trip
this is my sendvalexa one at home one at beach great for playing music without searching for station
i bought this product back in september and have loved every moment of it setup wa easy the amazon store and search bar make it easy to narrow down the thousand of book available and the battery is long lasting so that i do not have to worry about nstantly charging in month i have only had to charge it twice best part are the backlit screen with easy adjustment and ample storage
for the kindle fire is a bargain i had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day the only minus is amazon prime is now a year and it is hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot but still overall a great deal
go for a google if you want proper answer to any of your question
this is something i bought for a gift they wanted this and a of now she love it i am nsidering buying one for myself

it is good for reading book it is great for playing game yeah

good product just disappointed i can use the music off my phone i have to pay for a app with in the product which suck
cannot expect too much at out of the box it ha pixel damage already have it set up too much of hassle to return or exchange now
it is smaller than i one i had and it hold battery life good

i picked up the tablet black friday intending it a a gift for my daughter i knew beforehand that it had a crippled android o i also knew that it would not be top of the line for the price paid however for a sub hundred dollar tablet it is pretty good after a little tweaking custom rom with a few kernel adjustment

the alexa accessory is very accurate and handy for music and searching very good option for movie tv series and child is programming

great product easy integration with samsung smartthings hub and music apps such a spotify it also delivers great sound with the size of the speaker
i took advantage of the for one and bought of them really like amazon music and alexa
i have seriously enjoyed having alexa she make it a breeze to reorder any supply i may need for my home such a toilet paper or trash bag i also love playing jeopardy with her and listening to music she is also an awesome smart home hub and wa so easy to sync with my hue light and speaker definitely a purchase i m glad i made
it is a little bit heavier then i expected especially if you hold it for long and i do not really like the flash when changing page yet it is much better then ipad or mini if you are reading an e book i bought it for my pregnancy cause i can read book while breast feeding
bought this item cause it wa bigger than my phone and i uld put all my book on it with a larger screen
this tablet is great because it is from amazon you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kid finally put it down i have year old twin and it is hard to get them to sit down with the kid is kindle fire they are more than happy to settle down on the uch and play i highly remmend buying one it is a life saver
great for kid bought it for my daughter for christmas and she love it for the st it is a great tablet

after purchasing different brand x charge at a lower st and having both of them fail after a uple week of use i purchased this oem charger made by amazon for our kindle fire not only doe it work well ntinuously but it fully charge the unit in a matter of hour instead of overnight charging being required still work great and well worth the few dollar extra in price
fun product to own not much guidance from store staff on product feature
bought for my year old i remmend using a third party case the kindle one is great for impact but it pop out with a simple twist
the echo responds surprisingly well to my mmands great for music on prime and pandora

i love my amazon echo i love that i can ask it question and it will give me the answer plus i love to using it with my other smart home product
this would be my only ereader perfect for day outside in sun or at beach etc
really great product it is pretty good did what i needed
easiest money ever spent with instant gratification and still portable if necessary
excellent product work really well love it
wanted a simple tablet and this ended up meeting our expectation
bought for a kid and cannot be beat at the sale price
our first one wa defective but wa replaced by amazon our replacement work great
very easy to use for our seven year old will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capability and more memory she had an ipad lost it and miss that but this is the mpromise until we see more responsibility in how it is treated seems durable thus far
i bought this for my toddler and it perfect he is rough with it and it still work i wanted something that i use to teach him the basic of using a tablet and this worked great it me with a yr warranty
what a difference it make to read from the paperwhite instead of iphone
everything i thought it would be and more you need amazon prime to really unlock the potential it ha but it is a great buy for a great price
it awesome to be able to set certain feature to ensure that the child user get work done prior to free play
i originally bought the echo dot and took it back immediately to get the bigger speaker it take some time getting used to giving mmands word for word or it will not understand you use it play music and run multiple activity by voice mmands would def get and or remmend if you can get one when if they go on sale again
work but ha a tendency to freeze or get slow probably would not purchase again
amazon echo is a really ol device to have around the house especially if you have a smart home
a great entry level tablet all other tablet at that price do not stack up
purchased for an year old that wanted this badly appears to be rugged link up with my amazon acunt for ntent and access year warranty win
we bought this kindle fire for our autistic grandson he seemed to fight with it trying to connect to the internet after adult tried and tried to connect it to the internet it finally connected every time he me to our house we have to fight again to get it connected we decided this wa not the unit for him or any other kid so it back to the mini i pad
i decided to get an echo when i kept reading about everything alexa uld do not disappointed she now ntrols our tv security front door and shopping list with ease and she understands me unlike siri love her
cannot say anything bad about it great price and a great deal doe everything that my grandfather need such a reading internet and fun game to pa time
the fire tv give me everything i need from a medium ntent perspective to watch show and movie with several streaming medium mpanies netflix you tube etc user interface is very easy going to be giving these a gift for the family
kid love it i do not get to use it they take it over really want the other thing to me with it but to expensive they should have bundle for them
another classic from amazon would definitely remmend
silk is painfully slow and doe not work on many website had to install mozilla to use bestbuy m ironically i cannot put in order with silk the default fire browser if using silk make sure to disable the caching to amazon server with caching on the browser is almost unusable ad are really annoying only me on when you first turn it on but i do not even really notice what they are usually thing i d never purchase like makeup i m a guy or other junk these make decent device for the kid for playing game on too this is not a quality device like a galaxy tab but for the price it good enough because you know they re going to break it at some point
this is a great purchase it is easy to use i will definitely remmend it to other people
love how many possibility there are with this product
the whole family like talking to alexa it provides lot of tip answer song etc of urse it get much better after you train it and download more skill great product
i had the opportunity to cut my cable am having a wonderful experience
light and easy to read battery last a good while the built in light make it a pleasure to use at night in bed
best electronic reader the base kindle is hard to read because the lack of light and the other reader and apps just do not offer the quality experience and feel of the kindle paperwhite
the alexa ha been a nice addition to our home overall we have instant music weather a joke and best of all the ability to set a timer work a expected nothing more or le
easy to set up and use great tablet for a non techy
faster and better than any roku or apple tv great buy for the price
great ebook reader with ambient light page press and sharp text it is thin and light
i bought this product to replace my nvidia sheild i m glad that i did i have noticed that while streaming video that buffering is almost non existent in my opinion this is the best platform available for running the kodi app
i can ntrol light music shopping list and i am able to get my news read to me get the weather and order item from amazon without ever touching my mputer so much fun
i definitely love using the echo and it make certain task a lot easier
my daughter love this tablet hard to get her to put it down strong battery and a full tablet for her a she age
i like this tablet for the price i paid it is easy to use setup and i like the way it look
great product for home improvement and also playing music a a bluetooth speaker
the kindle fire ha exceeded my expectation especially given the price tag easy to use for someone like me who is not tech savvy lot of awesome free apps and i am finding new way to play with it every day would definitely remmend this device to others
bought this for my yr old son cannot get him off of it gave it star because it doe not support google play store and doe not load most pic on pinterest sometimes you might need a memory card if you purchase gb tablet
great simple to use light weight and love that is it wireless

very nvenient item to use easy to read ebooks and came with one month of amazon prime

volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear
gave to mother for mother is day to upgrade her older kindle she love it and enjoys the light since it doe not cause a glare while reading at night in bed
eady enough for my year old to use by herself cannoturn it on and choose her app me with is protective case great product for kid to learn on
we absolutely love our echo not only do the adult enjoy it but so so the kid the various reminder you can set are really ol not to mention you can keep track of your grocery list have it tell you joke the weather and so much more
it is affordable and a great product it a great ereader a well a a great tablet just the right size to play game and watch movie on
have been using this kindle paperwhite and it is a lot lot better from reading in tablet not eye stressing and really very handy nice product
the echo is a great product you can ask it anything i can not even to begin to list everything it doe if you have a tech savvy house the sky is the limit
i have not paid much attention to the fire since the very first one out year back but recently i purchased an amazon echo which i am thoroughly enjoying and i disvered that my echo wa capable of voice casting this basically mean that whatever alexa is saying can show up a text or picture on a screen recipe or weather map for example and you cannothen print it out so i wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an amazon fire what a deal for the most recent version that boast all manner of thing i even get free movie so i purchased a case for the fire that would work a an easel stand set it up a a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photo and whenever i want to i can voice cast from my amazon echo playing a music album i can see the album ver and list of song on my fire checking what is playing at which movie theater when i can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote and we have not even talked about using the fire a an easy go to for email or game
you give an amazing â tablet with front and rear facing camera a nice interface fairly snappy performance and durability all for under buck i canâimagine not buying these for your kid but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any mean i f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that doe most of the thing people want this little tablet definitely delivers the value
this doe not have the ability to ntrol volume or turn off and on the tv liked the programming didnlike the feature
bought on black friday for at a decent disunt would be a really nice product if i were an amazon prome member
i had an older kindle but it got a virus the only thing i have against this one is that it get very hot best buy did not carry vers for it
the fire tv ha been very easy to setup and use i have not missed cable one bit
first let me say that i only took one star away because even after getting i touch installed my little girl cannoturn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing button not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kid edition aside from that one single item this ha been an excellent purchase
i replaced an older tablet with this new version all of my e book transferred to the new one and i love it
i received my first echo a a gift and enjoy using it every day from briefing on news weather mmute traffic and access to whatever music i want to hear the echo ha a vast skill library which allows owner to do thing like play learn entertain and ntrol household device like light and appliance by voice ability far beyond the spe of this review new skill and product that can be ntrolled using the echo me along almost daily i have given the echo to friend and they have all loved it it ha a real wow factor
quickly charge kindle so son can use it worked great right out of the package

i enjoy reading in many different situation that is on an airplane at the airport the beach pool at home or in the dentist office and almost everywhere else i happen to be this product is easy to use easy to read and easy to carry with me
i wanted a simple reader for east of transportability and use although i still occasionally use my tablet to read i wanted something more light weight i have not tested this in the sunlight but so far i love it is smaller size and simplicity
what a great ereader amazon ntinues it dominance in the ereader field with this entry light and mfortable to hold perfect mbination of hepatic feedback button and adaptive back lighting seems to stay charged forever even with regular use i would definitely remmend this and would buy again
i love being able to download book and read them whenever i want i carry it in my purse and can read it anytime i m in a situation where i m waiting on the bus etc it is much more nvenient than carrying a book around the only thing that i d improve is making it easier to get the homepage toolbar to display

my granddaughter bella love this alexa so i got her another one for easter
i bought this for my daughter and i have no mplaints it is a little slow mpared to my ipad but it is perfect for a child
this product work very well and represents an extremely useful piece of artificial intelligence
like the fact that this is backlit but ha more of the ntrast like in the early version of the kindle that were not backlit
easy to teach my mom how to work camera not good
i have had no problem with the amazon tv it stream fast and ha a clear signal and ha a clear picture
exactly what i orederd a great product i have ordered of these from best buy
great product great customer service can stream almost anything
i love my amazon tv it work great for my need and i can also enjoy playing game on it
the device is excellent and you program is easy and your price is very enomic
this is a very good tablet nsidering the price while it is locked down a bit through amazon it wa primarily purchased for a senior citizen i felt much better buying this rather than other similarly priced tablet
bought this for my year old nephew and he love it
excellent for kid and safe ver so if dropped it survives
i m loving the tablet so far i really like the amazon underground and the fire o just updated so it ha alexa on it now
perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my ipad
extremely satisfied with the value and performance of the fire kid edition highly remmend for age and up
work fine charge a described
we had no customer support we returned the item to the store
read lot and lot of review before purchasing glad we did the whole family love echo music work great better than expected sound given the small footprint we do not have a connected home yet but look forward to adding these feature
love the amazon fire i definitely remmend this product
my son love his kindle great product for the money
this product is a total entertainer from being a bluetooth speaker to like a siri where you can ask all sort of question it is very informative like the weather of the day traffic info it can also tell joke which my kid find hilarious it is always updating to do more stuff like the recent news break
purchased for my grand child they love it they play and add gamehis
i use it to ntrol the smart device it work well no problem about disvering the device the loudness is more than enough for my living room furthermore it allows the bluetooth device to connect to it
this speaker is a must have the amazon echo ha wonderful sound and can ntrol a lot of electronics it cannotell you joke and even start your car
so far i am enjoying it and adding other mpatible device with it make it amazing
it is a decent tablet but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kid to share your amazon prime acunt for video and game apps you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchase problem is that this prevents free app and video purchase and you have to okay every thing they do if you allow them access to apps and video then that can purchase anything without limit on top of this they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive while you can hack it to add these basic feature you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so so it is useful but a pain too your need may vary
great for reading book onlinei would remmend to friend
i love the fire tv ncept i had the roku before and didnlike it so that went back to the store i have played with the fire tv for a uple of day and fell in love with it all my amazon ntents are on here i m trying to cut my cable tv provider out and i think i found a good solution when my fios ntract end i m moving over to the fire tv and i ll just get a hd antenna for the house this unit is very fast and very capable based on the android environment you can do almost anything on here entertainment wise
it is great thing to use i use it for everything even working out
thought this would be too advanced for my year old but she love it easy for her to navigate and learn patience game book and apps are great for the age range parental ntrols have kept her honest
the last model of kindle hdx have been terrible we have purchased of each model of kindle and up until the last model they have been great last year had to be replaced or time and for the same problem the slot for the sd card is defective i gave up and bought the newest model it shuts mpletely down if you try to plug it in to external speaker and sometimes it shuts down for no reason it is going back after the first of the year this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality a before phooey
just okay product wa for my girlfriend doe not appear she u it much except to steam music most of the question i ask it i get nothing i like siri better
great kindle very clear reading would forsure remmend
nice easy to obtain my nephew love it he ha yet to break it
this is a newer version of the fire i had previously and i love it i like the camera this version is lighter than the other it is taking me a while to learn the difference but most of them are improvement
it is great for reading but that is about it there are ad that are quite annoying a well a the slow speed of the device
run nice and smooth in long run overall great buy
this wa a gift for my daughter she wanted it to catch up on reading some book being able to browse the web wa an added plus
i would like to buy this because it caught my attention
this devise is much faster and easy to use highly remmended
love my amazon echo use it everyday also like echo dot for telling me the weather everyday
got this for my wife and she love it mpact library on the go for an avid reader
bought for uhd but not really worth the extra money
i wa a bit uncertain on whether or not we would actually use this enough to warrant the purchase after having it for two week i can definitively state that we do it is such a great speaker that doe not require linking to a phone and that make me listen to music far more often the assistant feature are also quite nice overall very worth buying and keeping in your main room
purchased two of these when they were on sale one for myself and one for my sister this device is awesome i had the hue lighting system prior to and had to have my iphone or ipad around in order to ntrol the light now with alexa i can let her handle that just by speaking to her now anyone in my mancave cannotalk to her and ntrol the light a well a the music amazon music unlimited is just with alexa great deal give it a try you wonbe disappointed
asked her to play a neil diamond song and she played for an hour
if you want to read anytime where there is a light source this is thereafter for you if you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper nsidering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model
i love the amazon fire tv and other amazon product i have purchased the gentleman who helped me at the store wa very gracious and patient in spending time explaining to me
love this tablet i purchased one for my elderly mother and she is able to use it real easy set up and ha many apps already ready to go when you turn it on
the sale people are really nice and knowledgeable to me i will me back again
i love my my fire tv it ha everything you need to stream show movie to your tv
this is by far one of the best investment ever i got rid of my tv service
work way faster than my android box and is just awsome
good for reading in low light situation it is also very easy to hold due to it size
i love my echo and the ease in using it i may buy another one
i replaced a lost e reader on the plane with a new one
my six year old turned this tablet on immediately on christmas day he knew how to operate it easily
i bought this for my daughter who wanted an ipad but for about half the price she is mpletely happy with it she even call it her ipad i think i may even buy one for myself to replace my aging ipad
it is great to watch all your movie and stream
very nice and efficient gadget that is so user friendly that even our young kid love to use
upgraded from a kindle paperwhite i love the brighter screen and increased resolution i am a book addict and the saving over printed material allows me to buy more book the availability of reference text is increasing which is a big plus
good tablet for a beginner easy to navigate and get more apps
wife is happy a they say happy wife happy life
easy to use just plug in and search for your favorite movie and tv show
i got this a a gift for a student and they loved it very responsive and easy to add apps to just buy expandable memory and it wa good to go
great tablet for many u purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple time just browsing the web and social medium
you cannot beat the amazon fire tablet especially for only i bought one of these for each of the kiddos and one for myself with the amazon prime membership these tablet are on fire
very impressive work just a advertised so very easy to set up
very satisfied with it a wellbas the servce received form sale person
very fun and useful product that can only get better with time kind of similar to siri or google assistant on steroid but ha the potential to be so much better
this is a excellent item for kid and better then spending for another tablet
i bought the echo based on a suggestion from a relative it is got some nice feature and the easter egg are fun to find sometimes i feel like i have to yell at it for the echo to hear me and there is a large amount of stuff that it doe not know amazon is working on that i would definitely remmend getting a dot a well if you are placing the echo more than foot from where you d normally be talking to it from
replaced my year old kindle reader with this nice and light much faster than my old one too
i have several of these tablet and they are still my favorite mpared to my expensive ipad best buy ship pretty fast and i am pleased with their online store
i bought this for my mom and she love it she said it is really easy to use and love the lighting it is easy for her to read
paperwhite feature is perfect for intended u outside on the beach at night
we purchase this amazon fire tv for one of my tv that is not smart and e are very happy with it we used to watch hulu amazon tv it is very fast and we have not had any problem
i bought it over kindle hd for my kid to enurage his reading instead of internet game addiction he mpleted harry potter series in week what a good decision to but it
most definitely worth the money i bought the fire tv box after owning a firestick and it is a great device especially if you are an amazon prime member twice the speed of the firestick with availability to add external hard drive and memory card bluetooth enables you to add keyboard and game ntrollers if you wish also ha an ethernet port so you do not have to use wifi i absolutely love it and if i had the choice i would buy a fire tv box rather than a firestick
great tablet it came loaded with a lot of good apps just for kid our daughter is and she had no problem learning to navigate and use the apps also the case keep the tablet protected and it is pretty tough with good grip well worth the money
i got myself the newest big kindle fire though my old one still work got this for the grandkids and they love it too
the whole family enjoys using alexa my son even ask alexa for his assignment lol
i bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trip or at appointment and she wa not too fond of it it is kinda slow and limited to what you can do one feature i did like is that you can set a profile for kid and they ll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use
we have had kindle for a while in our family so it just seemed natural to stick with it for my grandson is birthday gift
the amazon fire tablet is a great starter or mpanion tablet for watching video reading internet browsing and the like if you have amazon prime then you better get this
bought this for my dad he absolutely love it it is easy to set up and very user friendly
from what i am told it is excellent wa a gift

great tablet no problem at all excellent price
reading on the voyage is such a pleasure it so much more nvenient than carrying around an actual book i love that i can read in bed without disturbing my partner the backlight make reading a pleasure whether in the dark or outside in the sun truly well worth the price if you are a serious reader i love having several book available so i never run out of reading material while at the doctor or on a plane
generally it is good sometimes the touch screen doe not respond well
the tablet is good for a child between the age of great purchase
they are making update to the unit but it currently in a good spot the main issue currently is you cant hear netflix surround mode without cracking you must change the audio setting in netflix to stereo mode amazon is aware and they should fix it by the end of the november scrolling through the menu is quick i bought total a i have cut the cable at my house i bought an off air antenna and placed it inside ht my attic i used sling a month and you get the main channel we watched cnn a e history tnt and others and netflix if your a prime member you get more movie to watch also

this tablet is great for game and music my son enjoys playing game and music on this device
this is great for reading it is light and easy to read i love it
this fire ha a lot more option than the previous one i had purchased
it is a charger what else can i say
i bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening she had a huuuge portable speaker that didnsound very good and used many double d battery this one sound better and last all day i wa ncerned she would not be able to figure it out but it is so user friendly she ha no issue with it she love it and that is a good thing

love that it integrates with product like spotify and smart thing we use it on a daily basis
it is really amazing to know that when i think of a task i can ask and it be acmplished looking forward to integrating the echo into my lifestyle
it is good budget tablet for someone who want to use light apps video streaming and internet gb ram is enough for most apps g memory and sd card slot give enough space

several friend suggested i buy the kindle fire i love it great for traveling i can check my email update my facebook status and read all from one device
best thing to buy if your tired of having to pay high cable price very easy to install will be buying one for my parent a well
in my experience the amazon firestick is by far the best streaming device currently available
bought this for my yr and she love it we are still learning how to work it together but so far so good
the amazon tap is a perfect mplement to our amazon echo put this in our office space ha all the advantage of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is a good a any bluetooth speaker on the market and it is extremely portable
for all it can do at this price level is amazing make great gift too

i read a lot this tablet make it nvenient for me to carry many book without all the weight the screen lighting is adjustable for different light situation
it awsome work beautifully it is awesome perfect video quality doe what it say i m packaging best buy service wa nice
i love my tablet would shop at best buy again no matter what i need
now i know amazon price their tablet at their manufacturing price ie the price it sts them to make it they do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchase made on the device then they would having it be a mpetitive tablet on the market other tablet may have better spec but i bought this a a send around the house tablet and it doe it job very well picture quality is more than enjoyable the screen is bright lors are vibrant there is a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing i love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have add the expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lot of medium amazon is app store ha an underground feature so a lot of paid apps in the google or samsung store are free to download here they have free cloud storage connected to your amazon acunt so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing item this also mean if you want to transfer item between device it is no probbem at all they have a reading library that give you access to many popular title for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself ha many free or very affordable book aswell with no monthly fee this device can mirror a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all setting and apps onto your new one also over the year amazon ha been doing free update for device to make them run the current o this is a nice feature when it me to always having the newest technology but from what i cannotell it is not optional my old tablet ran with the black carousel type o but wa automatically updated overnight to the current more visually pleasing o it did give me many notice stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device wa connected to wifi it may be something to keep in mind if this bother you overall i like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you re getting
very nice tablet with many new feature would highly remmend this tablet my wife is very pleased with it
i purchased this for my wife her old kindle fire bite the dust this unit ha better ntrast and is easier to use she love it
i love my kindle paperwhite in white the battery last a long time without recharging your book are all in one mpact location you can add your own personal touch with lor case to protect your kindle i take mine everywhere i go

amazon echo is easy to use and provides a fun aspect to it application am looking forward to expanding to it use with home smart device only downside is with a grandchild named alexis not being able to rename is a bit problematic
the kindle paperwhite is my first ereader and i love it it work a advertised and is very easy to navigate i have not tried it in bright sunlight yet but have had no difficulty seeing the screen in all other situation it is lightweight and easy to hold i have a ver on it which i find increase the grip

amazon echopros amazing speaker and voice regnition i can be plus foot away and mmunicate with the echo speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated i mpare it with the ueboom device the amazon echo app is very easy to manage and add in different function to access so many different programed mmands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin the design of the unit is very nice solid from top to bottom quick summary of pro if you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather playlist talk radio and reading of non audio book back to you you will love this unit i wa not a believer prior to purchasing the device alexa is much more then just a novelty n the amazon echo is stationary if you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place so if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension rd or an outdoor plug if you do not subscribe to amazon prime then half of the unit greatest option are nonexistent with amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the amazon music store also if you have book you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those book on the echo and have them played back to you you can use spotify a a sendary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlist the voice mmands are clumsy what i mean by this is you have to ask the question exactly like it say in the echo app some example are alexa what is the weather like in manchester england alexa ask pga tour for the round leader or alexa play the best of the is play list from amazon music if you miss the ask blank she will me back with i do not understand the question n summary these may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the mmands exactly will limit the echo is capacity the unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic question overall if you have or plan to subscribe to amazon prime then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moment my family doe and the echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime to finding out the weather to seeing if our mmute to work ha any traffic to worry about if is not a lot of money to you for a more hand free toy then this is the unit for you i hope this help
a above but interface is nfusing and swipe are sometimes not regnized
my mother in law love her kindle she play her game on it and can use it without glass
this is a good product but the one i bought stop working after three or four typed sentence and the geek squad guy told me when i brought it back that i had to go into setting and clear the data when it doe that wrong answer that should never have to be done he had no idea what he wa doing and north haven best buy didnoffer to fix or replace my kindle this is the third product i have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wa not working properly or at all one manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if i understand best buy doe not actually manufacture these product if that is the best they can do to explain why they a the point of sale keep selling defective product the north haven store ha a big problem
bought this model to use in addition to my current year old kindle fire hd inch model so far i am very pleased with the quality of this unit the slightly larger screen make watching movie much better i didnwant the larger screen yet
worker told me about this device and the price so i checked it out and wa very happy
very nvenient enjoy having alexa around the house
bought for a year old granddaughter but our year old daughter love hers also
i wa not sure weather alexa would be a real help and flexible enough to be useful it is great fun and great info if it only wa able to play my music pandora and iheart music it would be worth it but it doe so much more every day we learn how ask the right question to get the best answer and info the weather and timer are always helpful daily bible verse is great her programmed answer to regular interaction is great i highly remmend this product
this wa such an awesome purchase i m nstantly asking her to play different music sending message set timer and even use her just a a speaker for my ipad she even ha learned the music i like and make suggestion i plan on purchasing the addition for light switch to utilize it even more
i really like the large echo by amazon the speaker are clear i bought mine at best buy they will stand behind their merchandise
my year old u it at school to scan qr de and do his online math
this is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing game
ok tablet from amazon added google play to device for more apps google how to do this
alexa wa the perfect gift for a recently widowed relative she love that she can have music playing or ask about the weather nditions or the current news a fabulous gift and almost like a new roommate
bough the tablet for my year old nephew love it great for online game and video
i have really enjoyed my tap alexa responds well and i love the charging dock on my desk the only downside is the app used for setup is not very good
this work really well and is very easy to set up and use
this product doe more than i thought outstanding
i bought this to test before i bought more a christmas gift for my grand kid seems to work fine
it is a good tablet but is a little slow downloading apps
who need a radio when you got alexa great product
i would remmend this to anyone who want a portable device like this it is well worth the price
we do not have the fancy tv or light alexa can ntrol but we love the music weather adding stuff to our list and calendar there are a few game my husband play jeopardy magic door etc the trivia and daily news are also awesome
great gift for my daughter she is a big time reader it save a lot of space and money
if you just want to watch movie or shop it doe the job not enough memory to do much else but for the price it great for kid
for the price it is so worth it we have about device on our wifi and this is the fastest one out of the bunch lightning speed and no wait time to download anything you get movie tv show music netflix get amazon prime too so worth it
i m a big fan of kindle tablet so i got one for all the kid for christmas
speedy delivery item arrived a promised great gift for someone who ha everything and want a little fun
amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e book it is also nice to get a six month subscription to the washington post their claim to have gigabyte of storage is misleading because it only give you and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage another problem is that you cannot flag something a being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablet
bought a gift for my granddaughter who is she love it play game watch video and listens to music
i gave this tablet to my yr old for christmas she is enjoying it very much i wa surprised how good the quality wa for the price i would definitely remmend it
work better than i anticipated now i do not need ambient light easy to use and read
i use my kindle fire hd in way for reading kindle book for streaming tv show or movie while riding my exercise bike to surf the internet
i love the idea of alexa and the next step to home automation alexa is fun and helpful at the same time update on the weather and news a well a some fact how to spell etc sometimes it doe not have an answer like when did nasa land on the moon i can ntrol my thermostat play all sort of music radio station ntrol it all from my phone and more there is a third party software mpany ifttt that ha appellate to allow you to acmplish much more with alexa
great easy to set up great gift item small and fit in purse
easy to read great for travel ha been an excellent purchase
great purchase would definitely remmend it to anyone
smaller than i expected but easy to hold very difficult to figure out how to access library delete book no user instruction came with it
echo is not just fun but useful to a small degree it is fun with apps like jeopardy and joke somewhat useful is the flash briefing with news and finding out the weather and the traffic for the drive to work somewhat more useful but still really just fun are the light you can buy and turn on and off by voice the most practical for me is the ability to add to the shopping list by multiple family member which then go to the alexa app that everyone ha which they can check while out shopping it is not star trek quality but i m still glad i got it
the tablet wa a great price i have recently brought expensive tablet but this one doe the same job a the others
it is tough to use these tablet if you are use to apple product internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the amazon program it is running everytime my kid play a game the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory i would not remmend these tablet for anything more that an e book reader
having a and year old kid help a lot it provides music for the kid while they are playing and my kid can ask alexa everything especially asking vocabs
bought these for my classroom on black friday the great deal wa what motivated the purchase but i m thrilled with them even if they had been more can connect to the internet so student can use apps easily make learning fun

we started with the nabi the nd edition when my son wa then came a few other rca tablet that ran out of memory or quit charging in month but i just cannot justify the st of the ipad for my year old that dropped my work ipad and i had to pay the amazon fire tablet is the perfect fit for his video game playing since i am a prime member he love that he can download music book and video for free being a prime member is almost necessary to make this tablet worth anything you can only buy amazon gift card no google play or itunes for this so let the grandparent know i like that it ha multiple user so i can restrict the time and what he is able to view play

allows me to watch netflix hulu or amazon video from any tv that doe not have internet access
i love my kindle it is light and i have not experienced nnby problem with it thus far i just wish i uld upload my music from google play on here
the paper white kindle is great make reading in the dark is so much easier
we had two appletvs one in the master bedroom and one in the living room we uld not watch both simultaneously because the signal permeated the shared wall and changed the channel of the other tv we got the amazontv to remedy this while it did rectify this problem we find we prefer the ease and simplicity of the appletv over the amazontv the amazon is cumbersome and difficult to navigate
it wa easy to use very nice picture and the quality is out standing it is a little hard to hold but if you put it on the table it is a lot easier to use i would like to buy another one some day maybe upgrade to a different kind but overall it is worth the money that you pay for it

before the inch kindle we the old inch one which both tablet are great but this one so much nicer the screen is bigger more storage amd love the lor on the back great tablet
use my echo daily easy to set up and use great for background music weather and traffic in the morning
pretty much that had to connect straight to router so side loading would be faster also video quality can drop with wifi ethernet is the way to get every little cent that this device ha to offer
i love my fire the game and the picture great
i really like this product i can access the internet with the fire tv and watch my show via netflix it is also user friendly
i had a previous model one with button around the case not the screen itself the screen on the one i purchased is brighter slightly clearer and the touch screen is far easier to navigate well worth purchase price if you want to read without the bulk of a book different font and word spacing is great something that will never be available on book i gave the nook a try but did not like it the back light wa terrible

a great ebook reader which is easy to read in sunlight and can be dimmed right down at night so it doe not disturb my wife top menu can be a bit nfusing but on the whole all user friendly
replaced an older kindle that wa stepped on and love the new kindle the lighted screen is perfect for night reading and the screen never wash out in bright sun light
i have the chromecast a well a the amazon fire stick the fire tv is a nice upgrade with a good remote i have read that the newer remote with the rubber button wa not a good a the plastic button but i have had no problem with it so far the tv is faster than the stick and the voice search function is very nvenient overall i am satisfied with the upgrade and even more so at the sale price

amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great
this is a really great upgrade from the regular kindle however it is not such an appealing product after amazon updated the base kindle to the same hi resolution screen may be worth waiting to see if amazon upgrade the voyage over the ming month
love it it fast the visual is great it ha plenty of room to download game and book on it i love the mayday feature on it because it helped is when we got stuck my year old can use it very easily a can my elderly parent the processor is fast and that make doing anything on it
this device is great for my year old it doe have a lot of preloaded apps and advertisement that we do not like though

i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it it been a nstant mpanion and i suppose ive read on average a book every three day for the past however many year on it i wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my ld dead finger for sundry logistical reason ive also made good use of amazon kindle app on my iphone no paperwhite screen naturally and all the ol usability that delivers but it work well and ha it own attraction a a mpanion to the kindle of urse there are aspect of the paperwhite which i would like to critique ah you knew that wa ming somewhere didnt you a a member of bookbub i get a daily list of alert and book deal in my chosen genre i take on many of them however ive found that even with the best will in the world i cant keep up some day it seems that for every book i read ive bought two there just so much good stuff out there the accumulative effect of this is that the number of book actually on my paperwhite ha been creeping ever upward for some time it now at about with this in mind ive noticed that while page turning ha remained exactly the same just about every other action on the kindle ha beme positively glacial not just very slow but so slow you think it malfunctioning the general nsensus appears to be that it to be expected once one ha that many book downloaded onto a kindle it will begin to behave in a flakey manner this drive me mad amazon state it can hold thousand of book i believe them but i figure i would need a send paperwhite to read while im waiting for action to mplete on the first one read more

the amazon echo is a good product the speaker system for playing music is good it is not very load but it doe fill the area with enough sound the microphone on the system can pick up your voice from anywhere within range a there a multiple speaker on the system once you have all your application setup for amazon echo it is a very handy tool to have

she ha dropped it a few time and the case is just great
i researched about tablet and based on my interest i choose the amazon fire tablet and protector i wanted reading and game mostly
simple and easy to use the wife take it everywhere
the only regret i have is that the price went down the week after i purchased it it is much easier to use than a phone because of it is screen size and it is capability
my year old love her kindle netflix and an abundance of game for her to learn from exceptionally easy to set up and use
good table good resoultion it better than the old table version my kid love it

this wa a great tablet but i downgraded to the gb because it wa cheaper and i uld expand the memory at any time
this tablet is so great it is easy to use the price tag is amazing the app store ha a great selection i would remmend to just about anyone
if you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchase you uld not ask for a better tablet
we bought the tablet for my year old who normally u my ipad and samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we uld have ours he wa very disengaged i believe it is because it didnhave the home and back button like our tablet do over all it is an amazing device it just didnkeep our little one entertained
excellent product for what it doe spouse love it nough said
i love the ease of setup and the accuracy of the voice regnition my new favorite aspect of the product is building all of the rule and iftt solution that are available what a great flexible product that is way more than a music speaker
great performing little device easy installation and great picture quality
easy to use crystal clear display two finger operation took some getting used to kept all my setting from previous model book already purchased were still available
we wanted to have echo to join our alexa experience and also to help out with our grandchild a they love soothing music a well a enjoy talking with alexa love the design and white lor of the unit

i bought alexa for my husband for father day since he is always looking up the daily weather forecast i think i use it a much a he doe i love the music choice and the speaker sound great
i use it mostly for listening to music a i learn more i m sure alexa will get smarter too i am year old and even i can use it way too much fun
i think i downloaded new apps i wait to surf the web this thing is so slow to respond my old refurbished ipad is better i really only bought it to stream hulu and netflix i m not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisement every day but i guess you get what you pay for i wanted inexpensive i got it do not buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics
this is a great tablet there are thousand of book and movie and music to choose from the amazon store it is very easy to navigate
i bought the fire tv because a much a i liked my fire stick i found it wa not great at buffering and i found that often the image on the screen would freeze the fire tv doe not have that issue and the ntrols and action and responsiveness to the remote are very smooth also the voice ntrol work wonderfully
bought these while they were on sale for the kid they loved it
doe a good job answering your question easy set up
i love this product so nice to have for trip
before the echo we played music often for our toddler via pandora on the amazon firestick i am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology but with a music use case in mind and to experiment i pulled the trigger and bought one within a week i subscribed to the single device option for amazon music unlimited at a st of month after a free day trial now we rarely use pandora due to the expansive amazon selection i also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into philip hue lor lighting my experience ha been positive enough to also buy an echo dot with harman kardon onyx mini speaker for my parent while great however there are opportunity for improvement sometimes alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before i made sure my mmand wa identical and clear the suite of skill is weak and mostly pointless i only use the news flash weather and traffic search functionality for fact answer is limited and based on review is likely worse than google home there is no integration with the firestick fire tv which is surprising currently one must buy a logitech harmony hub to do so alexa struggle to find certain classical piece even though i have nfirmed them to be available on amazon music part of the problem might be the many version which exist for a given piece a well a the distinction between mposer and performing artist overall i would remmend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music but do not expect perfection quite yet
love this product great for entertaining purpose
no bad for the price the bad is the got too many add an you cannot take it out
upgraded my year old kindle same old doesnt seem that great of a difference the graphical interface still suck but it decent for reading
this is a great item to own in your home so you can entertain friend family and yourself
i bought this for my husband for christmas got it for uld not beat the price we found this wa a greal alternative to pricier tablet and clunkier item such a laptop and chromebooks when all you wanted to to is check email or do surfing display is great definitely remmend
i have purchased kindle fire in the past for our girl and they loved them literally to piece they lasted year before cracked screen meant replacement wa necessary these new kindles at such a great price point meant a no hassle replacement wa easy they work great and the girl are happy
you are not going to find a better tablet for this price loading non amazon apps can be a pain and the o is not the best but it is great for game and reading
i love my kindle i bring it everywhere with me great for the price
bought these for my child they love the camera on them the last one they had didnhave is camera
wanted a cheap tablet to read book and mics i found the lack of apps to be disappointing it seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy book from amazon or to buy apps
but you do get what you pay for charging cable doe not work anymore and charging port is messed up other than that good device
this is my rd fire tv so yes i am a proud owner i am able to watch any program that is on cable television with a simple tweak and you cannotoo if you do a little bit of research i would definitely remmend this to a friend heck i would even remmend it to charlie mix

i got this tablet for a year old it ha been serving it purpose i am please
i like to read before sleep to help me wind down from busy day i love being able to quickly download book and take them with me wherever i go also i use this kindle to play game sometimes also but it is a bit slow for that at time perfect ereader though and a great price
great picture and worth the money great for even older tv is
great kindle very good for kid and adult we have one for every member of family can play game read and use internet also ha a kid time to limit time on what kid see or how long on
i purchased this to read book online and also to check out from my local library it take a little getting used to because i also have an older ipad but the more i use it it seems pretty easy
if it wa not for my receiving an e mail advertisement from best buy is weekly deal i would not have seen kindle fire on sale i have been most pleased and satisfied with the product and the free shipping offer from best buy
it is a great tablet believe it or not it is also great for kid use parental ntrols
great tablet amazing price got it a a gift and they loved it
we switched from roku to amazon fire it ha take some getting use too but we like it several friend remmended it and i would remmend it
i find this perfect for reading it is much lighter than the mini ipad easier on the eye
i replaced this with a fire stick hoping it would be faster and it definitely is it keep apps opened to where you last left them no more loading the app every time you turn on your tv well worth the extra
my year old granddaughter carry her tablet everywhere she love it
bought this for my dad to watch netflix and it work very well easy to use which is a bonus
alexa became my new best friend along side siri i ask her anything and everything shes great
i am so impressed with all the thing this little tablet can do it is not just an ereader although that is what i purchased it for the clarity is so improved from my old kindle fire which i dearly loved for year until my puppy got it i wa flabbergasted at all the thing this little tablet can do and it wa so much le expensive than my other tablet what a deal
i got this cheap tablet a a gift for a kid they can play game watch video and surf the web at a very reasonable price the performance is pretty good for only a tablet
work good but a little cluttered display i prefer the roku
great doe all that i want it too will be getting another soon
i wanted to buy the kid edition but it st a little more so i decided to go with this one and it turn out to be exactly what i need i am not sure but i think the only difference is the rubber case
i use the email search and read book primarily my fingertip are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve i forget how to access some thing but ask those who know the kindle fire can do so many thing for the modest price i just need to keep at it
trs heureux que le livres soient sur icloud apr m tre fait voler c est bien de pouvoir retrouver tous me livres avec toutes le note que j avais prises
i purchase this product to give it away a a gift good product overall
i have had the echo for several month and love it the sound is excellent the device regnizes my voice from across the room and it is handy to use
good good good good had a lot of show on it and it is good good good
work great for my grandson had the geek squad get a security plan setup on it and him acquainted with it battery life not great but with a bright inch screen on a thin tablet is not surprising
this tablet is a thing of beauty the entire family love being on it work great
good product i will remmend this product because it is an amazing voice ntrolled item which doe way more than you can imagine the speaker are also loud for the size
about this a a present for my year old daughter and she love it because not only can she play all her apps but she can also use it to read her book
my son love it read every day now i love the fact there is no internet game to destruct him from reading small size allows to take it everywhere wonderful screen for eye just perfect
lot of enjoyment beautiful speaker great sound great listening pleasure
purchased amazon fire for my sister in law she really like it it u it for mainly reading her book
i had gotten this primarily to watch movie and run some basic internet program i have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality
this wa my send kindle and i didnrealize that it wa not paper white what a difference i took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white this wa not easy to read for me
the review on this on amazon seemed awesome little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablet we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time nothing we already loaded and paid for several apps and now we re out that money also the charging rd that came with it appears it ha been used before there is some wear at the edge of it so i went online to see if i uld find this issue and there it is everywhere this is a problem that ha been around for year but android who is the ultimate culprit ha failed to fix it at the source when you plug in the charger there is no click so you know it is in place it just slide in and out we have had apple product for several year and never had an issue then the first droid product we purchase cannot even be charged from the beginning this will be going back to bestbuy and will buy another ipad mini sts more but is much much more reliable
i love the amazon echo i use it every day for news and weather update i listen to music with it and it is sound is really good i have now purchased of them for other family member and we talk back and forth through the echo
really beautiful display is great for watching movie and playing game it is very powerful for the price and you can play lot of game from amazon for free they even remove microtransactions from lot of game only downside is you need amazon prime to get the most out of your tablet
i enjoy reading my kindle easy to buy book long battery life
it great it move fast only problem the battery do not last all that long but it a good tablet i like
excelent product it work perfectly with the others appliance in my home
great bang for your buck great for taking to meeting
overall sound is not a good a echo my primary source for amazon ntent however the tap is great for medium volume music and radio station and a an alarm clock it is portability set it apart however it is nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disnnecting recent software update now allows listening mode it doe require a brief pause after saying alexa wake word but it doe work this drain the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button the portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my echo which is fabulous
i wa fortunate to order one of these a soon a it wa announced a an amazon prime member i wa able to buy the fire tv stick for during a two day sale i figured for that price i might a well test it out set up wa easy and straight forward i find that the interface is quick and easy to use the interface and streaming on the stick is much faster than the amazon app built into my hdtv this fact alone made this a great purchase here are some more thought i have on the fire tv stick so far pro quick easy to use polished interface wireless streaming work really well amazon instant video load fast forward and rewinds really fast a dedicated prime menu allows prime member to easily see what free ntent is available unlike chromecast the fire tv stick includes a remote can stream your own video by first uploading them to your cloud disk can play quite a few casual game awesome irresistible price for amazon prime user i got it for during the two day sale better spec than chromecast and roku stick ultraportable i plan to use fire tv stick when i travel for work and to visit family stream local video and other ntent using the plex app http www amazon m plex inc dp bywcde thanks bikerider n included remote doe not support voice search that remote sts extra would be nice to have a send fire tv stick model that includes the voice search remote rather can requiring u to buy a send remote probably wonbe able to use universal remote with this unless logitech offer a mpatible device not a fast a fire tv but since the stick is so much cheaper this is not really an issue read more
this wa a gift for my granddaughter she absolutely understand how to use the tablet and totally enjoys the product excellent charging time and last her all day best buy had the best price out of the nearby store staff wa very friendly and efficient
not a huge fan of product that are not apple but this one is good have not had any problem with them at all
cannot go wrong with it my first ever tablet it is worth the price
we are very well satisfied with the fire it is everything we thought it would be and more
this tablet work just like expected great for the game i like to play it is just the right size to carry in my purse no problem
it is easier to read my book and stuff on this than my phone also had a micro sd card lying around to expand the storage
bought a a gift it wa a bit smaller then expected but measured a described good value for the price
it doe more than i thought it would i have automated many part of my home and it is more then just a gimmick
not so great unless you want to spending alot of money on amazon for everything unable to download any google are android apps
i d been looking for a decent table radio for a very long time best buy had a deal of the day on these and i thought what the heck here is a table radio you cannotalk to it doe a whole lot more than that and there is quite a learning curve not so much in how to use it but to learn what all is available for it and then how to make that functionality useful the sound quality is easily that of a good table radio and aside from telling it to play a radio station i can play ton of stuff from prime music online and add skill whenever i need them from the skill store all the skill i have seen so far are free so store is kind of a loose term it responds to your voice immediately and is easier to use than siri or rtana with all the alarm timer shipment tracker wall street report entertainment update etc it is like living with a gifted le snooty ncierge i like it and would buy another if this one ever broke
i would like to rate this and half star while the adapter itself work just fine i think it is underhanded of amazon to make you pay extra for it maybe i am not technologically up to date but it seems to me that most people charge thing at a wall socket not with a mputer usb port i think that i read that charging with usb take longer a well just like an airline charging you for taking your bag on the plane now amazon is charging you for thing you need to make the kindle work pretty soon you ll have to pay for the rd guide and update not very good customer service
great for kid easy to use great price would remmend
this is the send amazon tablet i have purchased and they both work very well my year old doe his homework on the tablet the screen is bright and clear build quality is good and he is delighted with the number of game available
fast reliable streaming have not had any mplaints
this is my th kindle i use it a a tablet when i travel
this is by far the best stream box i own besides being a premium amazon memeber make this even better
the amazon echo is very useful for all sort of thing like playing music telling the time doing arithmatic calculation etc etc paired with a smart plug you cannotell it to turn light on or off for example all this is great fun and the echo is adding new skill to it capability every day the echo ha a decent speaker for music highly remmended
i m already enjoying reading using a paper white this purchase wa for my granddaughter it ha all the function i need one of the best thing is the length of the battery it only need charged once a month i know she ll enjoy her paper white a much a i do mine
the device is fun to use and is nice for the family i wish this model had the connection to other system like the smaller version music is really nice and easy to play through the device
i have only had this echo for a short time but use it all the time so fun
i gave the echo to my granddaughter for christmas and she love it
son is enjoying the whole tablet he is glad it is a quality product bought from our favorite store

love it so easy to use i previously had a nook lor but since the newest nook wa having problem getting library book at the time i decided to go with kindle worried i would lose the nook book i had purchased over the year nope not a problem just had to download a uple of apps m getjar m to download rd party apps once that is downloaded open m getjar and find nook there easy peasy
i bought this for my wife and mostly she wanted it for the touch screen and the back lit screen and finally after owning three different kindles she love this one she wear glass and find this one to be le strenuous after hour of reading i would def remmend this kindle to anyone
great product we are loving it highly remmended
i just upgraded from a touch to a voyage and uld not be happier in my opinion this is by far the best kindle yet it operation and feature are similar to the touch and paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very mfortable in the hand like other e ink device unlike fire the screen ha a matte finish which is really superb for reading some early review i have read mplained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue i have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully ha been rrected the built in screen light is amazing like other e ink device the voyage allows better ntrol and integration of dictionary which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to nsult several dictionary in situ to fully understand a word or phrase there is very little not to like about the voyage i can only think of two issue to nsider price no doubt about it voyage is expensive but in my opinion it is worth it when trading off price and performance i urge you to go into your nearest best buy for a hand on look at the various kindles particularly the paperwhite and voyage to see what you really need want or can live with a minor point for the evolution of e ink reader it would be nice if there wa some ntrol of the screen background lor or at least an implementation of a warmer background recent study suggest adverse effect particularly regarding getting good sleep from using electronic device with bright white or bluish screen disrupts melatonin production in the body this is one of the few in my opinion advantage of kindle fire and kindle for android where several text background lors are available i highly remmend voyage the new king of e reader
i love it i am still trying to figure out all it skill but everyday is a surprise

very good tablet for only my wife u for apps such a pinterest and facebook and she love it
i remmend this tablet i like it a lot perfect size and perfect price
the reader wa easy to setup for a novice reader and email user
everything on fire stick is awesome and i love it
i have to say alexa ha been a great disappointment most of the time she doe not know the answer to anything and tell u that she doe not understand the question i thought this thing wa supposed to get smarter a it go along we had to sign up for amazon prime and unlimited music just to actually listen to decent music when she doe know a mmand for example like say loop mode when you want her to repeat a song most of the time she understands that and then there are a lot of time when she simply beep out or even say she doe not understand the question no matter how many time you say it we use her mostly for a timer alarm play music and for question of jeopardy a day really need a lot of improvement ask her what a dog say she say bow wow or woof sigh if she can only be basic on that answer there is not much more she is gonna get right there are also a lot of pretty useless skill for her available we got it at a disunted price thankfully and i also got a dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price dot is even worse at listening to mmands than echo is
i wa looking for a tablet that i uld carry in my purse this kindle fire is perfect i pair it with my hotspot and i m online in a jiffy save my phone data i love it
the fire tv ha exceeded my expectation i use it all the time the increased spec make it hand down worth the extra investment over the fire stick
amazon fire hd tablet with a vivid touch screen and access to amazon underground this tablet make it easy to watch movie play game or catch up on your reading with personalized remmendations cloud storage offer simple access to your ntent from anywhere
i m not very familiar with tablet so didnknow what to expect but it doe what i wanted it to do
nice to read book and play game only down side is battery only hold charge for hour unlike the smaller one that last longer
i purchased this pad for my boy it is an excellent pad for a great price they use it for all the popular apps along with their favorite game sound picture and the touch screen are all great i uld not be happier with my choice if your looking for a great pad at a great price look no further this is the pad
the person i bought it for is very pleased with it
very happy with my new tablet everything is assessible and easy to find great pic quality my year old love it and ha taken ownership of it which show how easy it is to use
the fire tv box definitely connects faster when using for streaming well worth the money at best buy m definitely remmend it no buffering stable
great price for a beginner he is able to use it for game
i realized after i bought this and tried to use it with a mobile hotspot that it requires wifi to operate i didnreturn it because i m moving to a place that ha wifi in a few day and will try to get it to work
i have a firetv in every room because the processor speed is the fastest and it requires little buffering time i highly remmend this unit
alexa is fun and witty and very nvenient especially when i need a timer when oking
a a bluetooth speaker the tap rock the sound quality is excellent plenty loud when needed and excellent quality with no stutter in streaming i bought this one instead of the echo because it is portable and i can lug it from room to room the charging stand is very nvenient and the tap stay there most of the time having to press the button to activate each of the voice mmands is not an issue for me but is something to nsider if you want hand free use you may want the big brother echo device which is hand free but tethered in place by a power rd so not portable the feel of the tap with the black fabric ver is nice and will not slip out of your hand the fabric is like tough upholstery ver so it wonstain or be easy to damage but is quite attractive i am glad they did that a bare plastic would be easy to drop i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless and it work a advertised i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly question for fun i occasionally use it for shopping list which show up on my phone and checking the weather who know what the future hold when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do i understand that amazon plan to add more alexa skill all the time and if one got into smart house ntrol with mpatible product the tap would eliminate all remote which i already have too many of i think it is a really fun ol item and i am glad i got it it is so much fun to use voice mmands instead of typing especially the tiny smart phone typing i uld get used to this i have the alexa app on my phone which allows certain voice mmands to show up on my phone like shopping list to do list calendar the tap can also check traffic weather movie etc directly through wi fi no phone needed however the alexa phone app actually help you figure out what you can do with the tap the tap can read audible and some kindle ebooks to you a well btw i have not had any problem having it understand me which is amazing since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent obviously this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime member so you can stream prime music although it also stream pandora and other music service and doe many thing without any connection to amazon i guess the most unique thing about the tap is it ability to stream wi fi music directly without a mputer or phone driving it that and the voice ntrol i have paid more for smaller just bluetooth speaker so to me this wa a super deal and ntinues to be a source of fun and entertainment
this is a good tablet for the money remmended for first time tablet owner
this is the best purchase i have mad in a tablet my daughter love it
much easier on the eye than a regular tablet and long battery life you d think it uld be priced at the level of an inexpensive tablet seein how it is pretty much dedicated a a reader but it is what it is and it is a good product for those who enjoy readin
amazon fire is an excellent choice and st effective havent had any trouble it work perfect
good sound and very intuitive ask for an artist and voila it is there have not connected bluetooth bulb or outlet yet but plan on in the future

fun to use and learning more application by the day great product
i love the joke and music it brings my favorite song with great speaker quality
this ha the same pixel density a the kindle voyage the biggest difference being no pressure sensitive button and there is not a glass screen flush with the bezel the paperwhite is the best value of the kindle lineup

i am enjoying my kindle fire this is my third kindle but my first kindle fire i really like the portability and the fact that in addition to book the internet checking my email i can also use it a a camera
great quality picture and sound for the price easy to navigate through menu is and app is
gave a a christmas gift recently learned that it stopped working within two week
work great once you learn how mmands must be spoken
super and funis work in my xbox one smy light insteon
overall i like the fire hd tablet hard to beat at that price point sure the more expensive tablet are faster brighter better but for the money and casual surfing it is just right good mpanion to prime membership would not be half a good without

it wa a great experience i will be back in the future
this one wa purchased a a gift and the family absolutely love it
the kid love it they love the different lors so that everyone know which one is theirs
alexa uld hear me from across the room and worked well for playing music but i think you need a lot of smart home device to make the purchase worth it
would remmend it to any one great device to have at home or office
good for music but thought it would do a lot more
bought a a gift but have one a well love it great price
i love my new tablet the size is just right and love that i can access the internet or play game anytime anywhere
thanks to amazon echo i do not have to go through the burden of always going on my phone or mputer to get little thing done from setting an alarm to playing your favorite song amazon echo is one of the most promising product and best experience i have ever invested in
i love the box better than the stick for one i love that you can directly connect with an ethernet rd usking the ultimate speed and that is ha the android o which you can play with to get some of the best program out there
my mom love it it give her the very limited internet access she chooses and it is mpact to go in her purse
great i can watch anything i want with hd quality
no matter what i asked either alexa didnknow the answer or offered to order an item that i didnask for with a prime membership uld not even get my weather forecast right kept giving me the forcast for an area mile away i returned it by the way whatever i ask for from ok google i get an answer that is usually rrect never asks me to pay for a membership or offer to order something online for me do not need it do not want it
my kid are month and and they love this tablet it is easy for them to use and very lightweight
i have been with amazon prime for year and this new fire hd make it worth it i watch movie when i fly because i can download them the battery last for day i use it everyday now
there are some privacy ncerns a recently reported in the news and the device is limited without a paid subscription to amazon music
both love this tablet and the numerous educational apps available that i bought one for each
this game seems to be another good addition to the pokemon craze my son got this for christmas and ha played it often since he say that it is awesome which is high praise indeed
i bought this a a way to easily read while on the go i m disappointed a it is really too big too easily carry around i have disvered it is not all that easy to use it for reading purpose
my grandaughter love it found it easy to understand and can read anywhere she like great product
i love the echo i recently bought it for my husband until i had to get my own we love it i even bought the echo dot
really like this pretty easy to set up i love the bumper also the free time setting when time is up that is that and no figthing with mom i thought i saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if i find this to be true would hate to be charged for what the kindle wa intended for
this wa a gift to my sister in law and she love it only me with gb of memory but you can upgrade to and she did
the amazon firebox process a lot faster then the fire stick both product is good i connect the box to my router and it zip to netflix in a zap
good black friday deal wife enjoys it for reading
amazing box i love everything it offer this is perfect for everything you are looking to stream live for
easy access to my amazon acunt easy to set up and use
this tablet is quick and a good a my ipad i use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great i am pleasantly surprised by it performance
i have several stick and they eventually get glitchy and need to be rebooted the box never doe this it also run faster and responds better at all time get the box not the stick
everyone should own an amazon echo my echo is like having someone that doe exactly what you ask quickly without having to think about it or give you any back talk i love my amazon echo this is beyond anything i have used in the past i find myself relying on it more than i do any other device in my house the entire family enjoys it we are planning to purchase a uple more to have on each floor of the house we love it if you have been thinking about buying one and have not you should pick one up today you ll be glad you did a great device friend the entire family will enjoy by the way ordering fast food delivery is one of my family is favorite ask

so far so good didnlike the setup but once got thru that everything is good
very handy and easy to use i remmend this product
work great for a simple tablet not a huge fan of the silk browser but it uld be worse i am very happy with my purchase
this is a perfect tablet for our year old so he can play game
great because i can play music from phone without battery go in down
got this for both my child after the nstant break on more expensive product the best decision i have made they are happy apps are amazing if you are using this for internet usage not so much if going to amazon app store and book it is awesome
i originally purchased the paper white and after a week of that i decided to upgrade to the voyage for a uple reason perhaps my phone ha made me lazy but i have grown accustomed to auto brightness it is something that i do not even really think of at all until you have to manually adjust it the voyage is currently the only kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen i have read review that question the efficacy of it and those people tend to say it is hit or miss i humbly submit that that is because it is a smart auto brightness that adjusts to your preference at certain light level for instance if you re in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there and you manually turn it down a few notch the next time you re in that room the kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference wa at that light level and adjust i have had no problem with this feature and nsider it the most indispensable feature on the kindle it is brilliant page turn haptic button these are great and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page i simply squeeze i do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device a i find i have needed to adjust my grip lower than i normally would have held on to the device it is very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it the flush screen this make a big difference to me i wa not a fan of the recessed screen on the paper white and even the nook ha a flush screen amazon really need to introduce waterproof kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that this is also my only negative about the device the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the paper white and i have heard wether it is true or not that is because the voyage ha a glass screen while the paper white ha plastic i m not sure but the only time i notice this is when i m reading the the sun is directly behind me i may need to tilt the screen degree in any direction and it is easily readable again the general design is sleeker and feel better in my hand than the paper white this also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the paper white which is always a good thing to recap this is the only kindle to feature the auto brightness feature not even the oasis ha it probably to save on weight and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the paper white
love it great buy use it all the time yes i would buy it again
my year old sister in law spends many hour each day alone she ha macular degeneration and is not able to read or use a mputer the amazon echo ha been a friend and mpanion by making it possible for her to get answer quickly to all the question on her mind and to select music that she want to hear

a little nfusing if you are not already signed up for pandora also what doe echo do that the dot doe not
this product is easy to set up and navigate great for catching up on missed tv show
bought this after dropping cable the vue is the only subscription about month that offered nfl network sec and espn with dvr like capability playstation offer a cloud service included minor issue with the app so far it is definitely worth it i suggest researching which channel playstation vue offer to mpare with what you currently watch you do need a smart tv and high speed internet with a great connection

this is a great tablet if you keep your expectation in check is it going to rival the like of the ipad or even the nexus no but there is a lot of junk in the tablet market thankfully the new kindle fire is not one of these the screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube netflix and hulu i had multiple apps open and it didnfeel too bogged down if you can find it when it is on sale for it is an even bigger steal

best product in the market i love it and remmended to everyone
awesome reader great light ntrol to read in bed at night within waking your partner
i bought this a a christmas gift for my yr old granddaughter and it is very easy for her to use
all in all it is pretty ol but seems pretty limited to me get annoying when you nstantly have to access spotify before asking for an artist or it default to amazon free preview but i get it wish it uld answer more question but assume that will me with time update or future model feel like one of those technological offering that you try and fit into your life versus one that naturally fill a void
she like it but it started freezing up it is fun to her
cannot beat any amazon product especially the firetv box way faster
bought this instead of the echo dot and i m glad i did the speaker on this is really good very useful product
pretty good tablet especially for the price that being said it uld be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain process overall good machine for the price

i purchased the amazon echo a little over a month ago i like the ncept of the echo but unfortunately it is not a responsive a i had hoped trying to get local news is nearly impossible it is also not in sync with my amazon acunt package i ordered on amazon that are delivered it will still tell me are still in route i think the speaker is a decent quality and i stream music quite often i probably would not buy it again too expensive for the limited thing it can do again i like the ncept but it still need a lot of improvement it is advertised a though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me i have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience
work great very good sound doe so many thing
this is an average performance tablet and amazon centric this tablet uld have been better if amazon would have made it with android o instead of poorly designed fire o the app store and apps in that are not great this tablet can be good for people who want to read while travel or play some game while travel will be good i paid only so cant mplain for the price i paid i already have ipad mini and mparing with that make this tablet little slow
it is great for the kid but not intuitive with using took a little bit to get used to it
person really like the gift say it is ideal for his need and then plus easy travel size a well
this is a very nvenient tool for me to read book now it save me a lot of storage of book
for the price the kindle paperwhite wa a great upgrade to the old kindle the back light wa a plus when using on a plane and the charged lasted throughout the two week trip

this tablet ha pretty good resolution for reading and run smooth on basic game
all i can say is wow this is a really nice box i would remmend it
easy to use tablet good for the kid and around the house only issue is that sometimes it take long to recharge
purchased this for my wife during christmas and got a great deal on it mpared to the older version that she ha this model is faster brighter and more nvenient with alexa i would remmend this product looking for a tablet with lot of feature packed in it
a little disappointed with my first experience with ai you have to learn to mmunicate with alexa to get result i feel like she should have to learn more about me than i her however i understand she is a gen and would expect that future version will closer be to the jetsons than something that keep telling me i didnunderstand what you said i doubt amazon will update the existing unit with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy she doe have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill application
sale guy didnhave much knowledge about the kindle he wa not very helpful in getting me started
wanted something to use while charging my ipad easy to use
this is very easy to use and lightweight very nvenient
great product easy to use and readand the warranty taken make it worry free
nice to listen to music and tv anywere in my home
this tablet is so easy to set up and use very intuitive love love this device and all of my book can be transferred from my old version awesome
we are using alexa for many daily chore music weather radio etc
i love the new e it is especially fun to listen to all the great music
i m an avid reader i have different kindles including the oasis and voyage the paperwhite quickly became my favorite the battery life is outstanding
the echo is in our kitchen and is a great device for listening to song the wife love it and the kid like to ask it question about all kind of different subject got it on sale and for the price i uld not pa it up it wa a great buy and very fun to have around
it is a great table for kid and first time user of table
great battery life and having the back lit screen allows you to read in dim or no light
both my year old and my year old love this tablet
work awesome especially the k ntent this wa an upgrade from an original fire tv box and work better than the old one
alexa is amazing keep me and my kid entertained for hour everyday
alexa ha been around awhile so it doe what you would expect it to do i wa slightly le impressed with it only because i wa not an amazon prime member which limit is productivity if you want a full experience with alexa you have to be a prime member since i mostly use google product already it made sense for me to get the home which to me is a little bit more functional than alexa only due to the google search engine overall if you re in the market for such a connected device you cannot go wrong with either
purchased before going on vacation good price and mpact design work great better than paperback
i purchased this for my wife for mother is day a the screen on her phone wa too small she thoroughly enjoys it and u it daily just what she wanted and needed
work well i really like the bigger screen up from the easier to read just a easier to use if not better
great price item work perfectly and my daughter love it
good at this price running smooth a expected and cheaper than amazon
i purchased this laptop for my son and he wa able to set it up himself i rerded and helped him with password and documenting speed of the mputer is average for basic web browsing and running program memory seemed to hold it own and he wa able to jump from different program with it being an i and basic memory i explained to him how restarting it once a day would keep the speed up he ha enjoyed and used it on a daily basis with no issue
i had the original kindle fire from many year ago that survived many a drop onto ncrete floor without sustaining any damage so i hope this one will last a long easy to start up and charge fast already had a uple of o update that were very fast downloading and installing no problem
the echo is very ol the voice mmands take a little practice but the option are fantastic totally remmend
i got this for my wife and she love it great speed and display
i have seen this device advertised i decided to give it a try and am so glad i did it is so neat the question you can ask it and it me back with the answer in send i also like playing music through it
bought two one for each of my son is and they have had so much fun talking to it each have named their favorite name always wanted one after going to a business meeting where one wa demonstrated
great product exceeded expectation love the paper white screen

the kindle fire ha been my granddaughter favorite
i purchased this tablet for my sister a a christmas present
with the amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high end tablet for le than that is hard to beat
decent sound a a music source rely on it for news briefing and weather report
great sounding speaker and microphone seems to work well good option for playing music a well a easy to set up wish there were better connection with iphone so it is easier to request and play song from itunes a well a to make call from phone
first we purchased the firestick that ran off of wifi only ours wa too far away from the router and wa buffering all the time close by it worked great but we upgraded to connect directly and we have had no problem wonderful product and serf our need the voice mmand for question is a nice feature a well
fun and reliable good quality for the money easy to use
i expect my tablet to be a workhorse available to have two or three book open that i m reading hanging on to my email and ready with summary of the news the new kindle fire doe it on a larger brighter page it is a work horse more than worth the money it go with me might and day i do not know what i d without this gem

love the sound quality perfect for what l needed it for
it is easy to use i can check my email play game from appstore headline news amazon deal offer very reasonable price
this is a low st item that provides huge return for the money spent it is a great little tablet
the flush bezel and display are a huge improvement the text is crisp and easy on the eye the page press function and inclusion position of the touch sensor is perfect the price seems a bit high for something a simple a an e reader but if you love to read this is a must have you will not be disappointed
great product for home use and set up
good for reading on the fly and great battery life
i love the fire tablet so much so that i have purchased about for my son niece and nephew

i m an optimist and i tend to give star review more than anything which i have had people make a mment about that however i cannot give a star review on this because it is such a simple unit and with technology these day it should not be a expensive a it is that being said the display will blow your mind it look like real paper i highly remmend

i love this tablet the internet on it is so fast it is really easy to use
i love to use it i read several book in my beautiful kindle
my granddaughter love this and it came a promised
i am very satisfied with the amazon tv while i have used an amazon firestick i bought this unit primarily because of the ethernet connection in order to get a faster streaming speed while watching tv show and movie another nice feature is the usb connection it make it very easy to view and listen to music audio video and photo on a thumb drive i remmend it to anyone who ha internet hardwire option available

i bought four of these tablet two of them i need to return because a soon a my nephew is turn them on there were problem with screen being almost mpletely white and black in the rners you cannot see anything i have checked the setting it is not the city it is the tablet smh i am disappointed
it is amazing that a quality tablet is this reasonable i got a special price but even at it is a deal the down side not enough to rate it low would be the apps are not play store though the o is android based you may not find certain apps you want but there are many in the amazon store to choose from also the screen saver are ad but you can pay and amazon will take them off
i love the fire tv box it work flawlessly i remmend adding the spotify app it make all your sorround sound bluetooth worth every penny for sure do not think about it just buy it
bought this for my year old son he navigates through apps and site easily the built in wifi is helpful for car ride parental ntrols block him from buying every download he find attractive we re still trying to figure out how to get alexa to audio respond
this is my send kindle paperwhite i have bought at best buy i would not be without it and take it everywhere i go the first one just wore out a i had it for several year i have noticed new addition from the previous one which really help
i got this because my fire stick always give a warning that it is too hot have not had this problem but did experience problem i have my p apple tv running through a hdmi switch no problem when i had the fire stick plugged in the amazon tv will not work with the switch for it to work it need to be connected directly i have three tv is and three different switch didnwork on any and yes i tried different chord other than that work great
the quality of the speaker is better than i expected and my kid really enjoy playing game with alexa the only criticism that i have is that it doesnt do well with voice mmands from a distance
i m loving this new fire mainly because i didnfork out a uple hundred for it my only beef is that magazine are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so do not look great on this
bought a gift for senior setup process uld be easier
like it except that it wont call people for me when hooked up to bluetooth would be nice to be able to call out
this is a very fun and useful devise very easy to setup it ha great sound i wa able to setup with the apps to turn on off my tv along with my light i love how there are so many new apps i cannot wait to connect it to my sonos speaker i love it so much i purchase several of the amazon dot for my family member for christmas gift
i love the kindle we purchased of them they are great for the little thing that you do not want to pull your laptop out for and good for the bigger thing that you need to view on something bigger than your phone the apps are good and game are fun
purchased the tablet a a gift for my mom and she love it
the family love this because they can mmunicate to this device and ask it to play their favorite song or question or just about anything you can google even joke
the only bad thing i can say about this tablet is that after using certain apps you have to turn the tablet mpletely off in order to get to the main screen
this tablet cannot be beat for the price we paid just wish i would have purchased one that wa bigger

the firestick game me the experience i wa looking for
i wa exited about it but got disappointed same old gui k is limited search option is only for amazon
better than i even thought it would be such a great purchase i bought one for my parent
this tablet is a good one for everyday use it is small but it ha a clear image not sure if i really wanted one this small but it ok for now
this is one of the most powerful streaming device in market kodi run super smooth on this and not to mention the great feature that me along with amazon prime membership
it a good tab for the price would remmend it for entertainment or kid use only
exactly what i wanted but the battery drain fast when on hand free mode
this is a good product for the price many more thing can be done with this fire than we dreamed about
the speaker sound so much better than the dot i stream music through there nstantly
the hardest part is learning how to download the book
great price for a tablet like the size and look
this table is good for child because wonbreak if dropped however the only problem i have a well a other people in the family who bought the same table is the charger port that get damaged after first few day of use
i didnlike that this model came with a usb cable but not a plug other than that it met my expectation synching the new device with my existing kindle acunt wa easy and my initial fear that the touchscreen would llect fingerprint and dirt ha not been a problem so far
i wa expecting a tablet good enough for the kid to play and download game and i wa told at bb that this product would work for these basic need it seems like everything i download need to be through my amazon acunt very few item are for free and everything take forever to download and or open wish i uld return it
have not received mine but have spent many hour with my friend it really is amazing great fun
love the idea that this tablet is expandable to gb the ipad mini that i also have doe not mpare even close to this tablet a it is not expandable beyond it gb overall just an outstanding tablet
nice tablet for the price able to browse internet with ease
great tablet use it for reading and email great price
this is a great pad device big and good display just you have to familiar with the amazon o and they build it for e book so it will a little bit slow for even web site surfing more serious in game playing
i bought the amazon tap when it wa on sale i already had the amazon echo and the dot the tap wa a pleasant surprise speaker are not a strong a the original echo but the sound quality of voice and music is more than acceptable thetap will do virtually anything that the more expensive echo can do â including hand free voice mmands plus it is portable and ha a wireless charger base so that it stay charged it is easy to set up if you follow the instruction carefully it pair with your home wifi network and can also act a a bluetooth speaker when paired with your phone or other audio source

i owned a fire stick previously but when i bought a k tv i wanted a medium streamer that uld playback k ntent i tried the roku but ultimately returned it for the fire tv because it allows cec nsumer electronics ntrol over hdmi which the roku did not for those who do not know cec found in most new tv set allows your remote that me with the tv to ntrol other device connected through an hdmi cable now i only need one remote for everything and didnhave to go out and purchase an expensive universal remote the fire tv wa exactly what i needed for my k setup and now i use my fire stick for travel great product and great service from best buy

i just used this after receiving it a few day i tried a uple time to use it but my kindle registered connected to a low power charger too expensive for this to happen i have never written a negative review till now
work great a a e reader a well a a tablet my son love it
kindle is nice for road trip to watch movie good battery life it is ol

bought for the grandkids and they work great might get one for myself
got it a a gift for my son to replace his old kindle
it is hard to beat the quality for the price it st great for the kid
i bought this for my year old autistic son we have downloaded all kind of sensory apps and learning apps it is such a wonderful tablet to take on the go a well a for home use
i got this for my niece for christmas she is going to live it
i bought this unit since it is mpatible with k tv and it is great
alexa work pretty good if your internet provides enough service for you
easy to setup and easy to use it wa a gift and my husband love it
this kindle fire is great the kid love it they can watch show and play game keep them entertained
just bought a my first house and this wa a fantastic addition a i unpack i have an amazon prime acunt which give me amazon music so i have just been requesting music a i unpack and clean solid
i especially like the variable lighting which allows me to read at night without any external light or in the brightest outdoor light
i bought this kindle primarily for traveling and quickly fell in love with it i love the appearance and weight
great product and best buy wa the best place to purchase from
i ll admit that i sometimes think of this a the mputer on star trek but i appreciate the wit of some of the response like when i asked alexa did you miss me
in this case the answer is yes amazon beat google by a long shot the google product doe not match up amazon ha done a great job integrating with other home security product a well a the hue nest etc on top of that the voice regnition is send to none if you re an amazon acunt holder you can order with it if you re a prime member you can access it is music you can anyway just get more with prime also play well with other apps like pandora it is great beat google hand down
i bought the amazon fire with realistic expectation i have an iphone se outstanding phone so the intention wa to be able to play some free game view facebook etc on a slightly larger screen some light web browsing and maybe read an electronic book here and there it ha served this purpose with excellence so far not the fastest tablet you ll ever find i m sure but no slowpoke either and i would venture to say you will be hard pressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at highly remmended
i wish it uld stream music from my private na and not only from purchased online music source need to buy hub and other interface for it to ntrol light and heating
lady had been looking for one of these since xmas and found one and love it
if your looking for a simple tablet that doe basic thing this is the one for you i like it
my kid love this tablet the setup wa so easy and the amazon store ha a bunch of educational apps that my kid can enjoy playing and learning
need an alternative or supplement to cable tv this is it there are many entertainment option with the firetv i can not sing it praise enough
bought this for easier reading and it meet my expectation great display fidelity
the echo is great for reporting the latest news weather and playing music
i got this tablet for one of my usin is kid who is really enjoying this so far
i like that you can choose to use wifi or ethernet cable
i started with the fire stick and then upgraded to the fire tv it ha a much faster processor and run add ons better great for your home tv set
i love alessa i love to play music all day long
i like the nvenience of my kindle a lot for reading and the process for buying book from amazon is easy and flawless a well a cheaper than buying physical book there are a lot of special of very good book i just wish the kindle wa slightly larger more the size of a typical paperback book because when i m reading it feel like i m turning a page every few sends
it is all i needed while away from my mputer on the go and at work
thought the echo wa portable have to keep it plugged it to operate or buy an external battery returned and bought the smaller tap which ha a builtin battery
echo need more skill and third party application and customizations and bluetooth audio multiform simultaneousso far happy with this product
love the no glare feature perfect for outdoors this is light weight and will be great for travel
just bought seems to be working great so far not sure how long it will last
got the niece wife and myself these for christmas figure they were cheap enough so why not these are functional tablet in every way we have not found any problem with them the display is not a hi resolution so i wa not expecting great i have had phone and tablet with the same resolution but never one that looked quite a lack luster a this display they are ok for the kid to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had this one probably wont last much longer but it is cheap i wish i would have spent a few more buck and gotten better one for my wife and i though if you want a disposable tablet or lor reader for magazine and such you ll probably be ok with this if you want a good tablet think about buying a good tablet
this tablet is le than and is an outstanding little tablet the only negative i uld bring up about it is that it is geared towards selling you stuff from amazon it doe book web surfing and apps quite well though it is well worth the money and putting up with the advertising
this is very nice for a little over dollar it took a bit to get use to after using a ipad i got this to travel with or take to the beach nice size very lightweight
great tablet for the money and basic medium i enjoy it for reading audible and streaming video u amazon app store which u google play thousand of apps
i previously had a roku however decided to purchase the fire tv box instead it definitely meet all my need and ha been a real pleasure to use
if you are into reading then this is for you i didnthink the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room great for reading outside
i got of them they didnhave google plus me no like
i really like this product much better than my old kindle
this is a great tablet for my year old grandson the ver is great in that if he drop it it wonbreak great buy
i bought this for my sister a a birthday gift and she love it
you do not have to pay a high cable bill if you purchase product
i wa looking for something easy to use if i didnwant to go on the mputer and for this is great
my family ha been enjoying amazon stuff more lately and the kindle fire tablet is no exception i have not spent enough time on it to get what i need a efficiently a i can on my samsung galaxy tab but my husband prefers it to his galaxy tab currently in use by our yr old son remote are too mplicated sometimes our family joke anyway but he ll sit down and browse the amazon ntent get all the car stuff he enjoys reading and i have not heard a mplaint or call for help i have not even heard any annoyed caveman sound i like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet may sound trivial but my main mplaint with both galaxy tab is that the input are on the bottom so they cannot sit upright for use while being charged bottom portrait for the tab and bottom landscape for the tab either way it hinders function functionality during charging is not disturbed with the fire tablet when i m ready for a new tablet i ll probably get the galaxy pro because it seems friendlier for blogger writer etc but the kindle work if you re not looking for something too mplicated price point is great too
tablet is good for older kid with added boundary
got two one for each of my grand daughter they love the portability and it allows them to both be up at the same time
good tablet and a great price i use it for reading netflix and email
so we have been getting our home setup for automation for a while now buying one piece at a time and implementing them make the st le scary we have a wink hub cree led light myq garage door opener atdigital life security and automation nest thermostat etc it ha been a blast getting all of this working together and seeing how it can really benefit u in real life rather than in cheesy video clip on youtube of people smiling and hugging while they turn the thermostat down a degree with their phone you may be wondering how the echo fit into this review well before alexa came into our life we had to have a phone or tablet on u unlock it find the relevant app open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do now we just say alexa bedroom light or alexa turn the bedroom lamp off or alexa play bloodhound gang on spotify etc the echo make utilizing your home automation much easier plus with the ever growing list of skill i can start my car play a game listen to music get my news ntrol medium playback order a pizza buy stuff from amazon even schedule an uber pickup etc if your specific car or app or whatever is not available yet just give it some time and it ll most likely end up supported very very ol technology
these are great for my teen to use at school now that their school u online activity
affordable for the kid and quality is good not like other cheap tablet amazon always make a good product
it is a great tab for low end application especially for kid
good tablet to purchase for a first time tablet user
it is easy to use enomical and perfect in size for a llege student but is not good for hd my daughter said
i have kodi installed and this box work wonder if you do not have one get one
i love this product and my kid use it everyday to watch movie and serial
ha some good apps and performance is good for the spec
not too satisfied with the sound and it loses bluetooth connection no matter what phone i use either iphone or android
easy to read in the sunlight i really like that it adjusts to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere
i wa not happy when my original kindle paperwhite failed after the warrantee period expired but i loved the battery life and readability in almost all environment
i got this for dollar a part of thanksgiving promotion it normal price is it a good starting level tab for basic purpose it not a smooth a ipad or galaxy note but it ok for basic browsing i specifically got this for my year old to watch youtube and play some light game and it work perfect i am not much used to android so i found it a bit tricky to use it also ha a slot for microsd card so that solves your memory issue
great way to save on cable wifi enabled so really simple to install
i bought this so i can save all of my book it wa a bit small at first but you get used to it overall i am very satistfy
if you want a tablet to perform basic function you cannot do any better than the kindle fire check email social medium surf the web download and read ebooks with no problem good battery life
very functional easy set up and great so be quality

able to surf the net and facebook but slow in those apps and you get all notification that occurred since the last time you were on your kindle even if you checked your facebook notification prior to using the kindle excellent for it purpose of reading only which is why i bought it
my special need son frequently drop his tablet this is a great low st option when no protection case can hold him back

this is a fine tablet for a bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for it is not bad
i like the way i can read many book and magazine a well a play various game on my kindle
echo is awesome hand free to listen to music get weather and news amazing
the amazon fire tablet is a great tablet for the money got it during black friday for but even at is still a good deal you can get most apps on the amazon underground store for free and most add ons for the apps are even free mpared to cent each for apple device only drawback for my preference is that there is not a facetime app to videochat with other apple device user with other than that pretty much any other io app is available for the amazon fire video play very well not hd quality but not bad either this is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet check email facebook etc and for the price it cannot be matched by any other tablet on the market
i love this charger charge my device super fast and i do not have to wait hour
i bought this tablet for my son he used it for mainly game i though he would like reading his book on it but he prefers the actual book v digital book it work great fast and vibrant lors i play with it on occasion it fit in my hand at night and it is larger than my phone but not a expensive a other tablet all in all it wa worth the money
information and music and all you have to do is ask alexa is amazing
without sting a ton like the apple tv the amazon fire tv ha everything a rd cutter uld want
reader is lightweight easy to hold and make reading much easier le of a burden with lengthy tome reader is effortless to learn how to use and access other book within our library
i like this tablet it is a little slow starting up but st and display are very good it is mpact enough to take with you battery seems good so far i put on a few game for the grandkids i am glad i purchased this tablet
using echo for weather music and asking question worry about ordering stuff online still learning all the thing you can do with alexa
i think this is faster and more reliable than the firestick no drop out
bought the wemo wifi switch and plugged the tv into it great for voice remote turning on off the tv
i got this over the roku ultra which is k mpatible roku wa garbage the amazon fire tv is a must if you have a amazon acunt it a great streamer i have no buffering problem
i think this tablet work a well a my in hd kindle fire at it is a steal it is such a bargain
a brilliant tablet that ha further raised the bar for the rest of the mpetition
fantastic deal for price doe everything i need and then some
i m planning on returning this tablet just a soon a i can
purchased for my mom to read ebooks great performance screen look good easy to use very happy with this purchase

siri who is all i have to say alexa is now my go to ai

very useful for night time reading responsive and intuitive display
i liked this product a real good value wa very happy with the customer sale person that helped me find what i wa looking for and demonstrated how it worked and the benefit of one brand verse the other that i wa nsidering
this is an awesome tablet great price lot of memory fast processor
this is the fourth one of these that i have purchased my grand child love them between the one year of programming and the two year of warranty i do not think there is a better tablet on the market for child excellent product and it work very well with the child at what ever level they are at
i m not super thrilled with the proprietary o on this unit but it doe work okay and doe what i need it to do appearance is very nice price is very good and i cannot mplain too much just wish it were easier or at least more obvious to port new apps onto it for now it help me see thing that are too small on my phone while i m traveling i m a happy buyer
mpared to the firestick the fire tv blow it away
the kindle is perfect for fast browsing reading ebooks my kid love the product and i am now using the tablet for work it fit perfectly in my bag and with the swipe method i cannotype a lot faster
you need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan disappointing for sure the sound is ok i think the larger model is probably better
i absolutely love my fire tv i use it with netflix boo boo espn and a ton of other apps i highly remmend this product if you plan on cutting cable
i got this for directvnow hulu cbs omg a lot of different apps it wa time to cut the rd i love it
got it on sale for so i can say i got more than my money worth so far so good
i purchased this item to cancel my cable tv and use playstation vue for the television channel like syfy and others the network connection allows the use the high speed internet without bogging done the wifi the only issue i have enuntered is the remote can be laggy but it ha le lag that the fire tv stick remote
i would remmend this for kid age to they can play al kind of game that can be downloaded
i cancelled my satellite service and bought the fire tv after using the firestick and liking it it is a great product and with my amazon prime membership give u lot of viewing option especially for the kid who do not mind not seeing the latest episode of their show we also signed up for playstation vue to take the place of our satellite service which is available on the fire tv the kid also enjoy all the game on it the only issue is that many of the game that the kid want to play require a separate ntroller which seems to always be out of stock whenever we think about ordering one
with an hd antenna and fire tv we said goodbye to the cable mpany everything you want to watch for a fraction of the price
i love my kindle if you re a bookaholic like me there is no cheaper way to read once you have made your initial investment there are literally hundred of book available for free or cent and other low price subscribe to a service that notifies you of these deal and you re all set
i love the product it make it very nvenient for people like me who multi task and it link to your phone and smart home device
i bought better than we ever dreamed for money spent
purchase this tablet for my mother her first tablet to read book
i m a pc guy that wanted to try a tablet without investing a lot a a first step so wa a great way to get in it fine for browsing photo checking email and weather so far so good
very easy to set up and easy to use touch screen response is great this is my first tablet and i am very pleased there are lot of available apps
this new paperwhite wa purchased to replace an older nd gen kindle this one is bright easy to read and small
gave one each to my parent and they liked the gift a lot
the echo ha beme an integral part of our life from turning light on off to playing music getting news brief or sport sre and asking it question whether important or silly echo life up to it expectation if you are in to home automation it is a good solid start amazon add new skill by the day that you can enable from the free alexa app once you buy an echo you will want another another or more skynet is here embrace it
pro look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader the price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it you might want to nsider the upgraded kindle paperwhite with ppi if price is a ncern n the bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the paperwhite
this solved the problem of my daughter is lost kindle charger
the best e reader that i have ever used i would remmend it
the best tablet for kid the year unlimited apps is my favorite my kid love it
the new amazon fire tablet is surprisingly good especially for the price the performance is good the size is good and the weight is good the biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot which is something new for this generation of fire there are a few downside issue however first the screen ha splotchy illumination from the edge lighting there are numerous light hot spot around the edge especially at the bottom where the menu bar is after a while you get used to it but mpared to other higher priced tablet it is annoying the software library is the send biggest issue amazon ha done a decent job in adding new software but it is app store is nowhere near a robust a the google and apple store the last issue i have is the day warranty but that is how they keep the st down amazon developed the fire tablet to sell other amazon product and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability web browsing is much better than my first kindle fire and i think better than browsing on an ipad the app that surprised me the most is the e mail client and how easy it is to use in my opinion it is a lot better than the native e mail client on the ipad or a window tablet if the build quality a good a a ipad or samsung tablet no not even close but for it is pretty good device if you do not mind dot of light around the edge
loved the size and lightness of the product stay charged for a long time
it wa well worth the black friday price the screen is so clear it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hand easy and fast when navigating
work perfectly for my kindle

i have purchased a fire tab before for my wife i would say it wa the best nsideration for a tablet it lasted for a good time and i wa really apprehensive from getting her one it is durable in use just do not go dropping it on cement the only reason i gave a star is because i have not used it yet
i purchased this to give it a try man it is great it is a very reliable and responsive tablet connects to wifi very well and doe not have buffering issue a of yet anyway i set up his and hers acunts but wish i would have bought two so when we both want to use it at the same time
it is easy to see and adjust font style and size great for reading at night
i bought this to read book and to use the internet i liked it so much i bought a send one for a family member

brought for my wife she love it she spends a lot
have been pleased with my purchase of the fire hd a it is video quality is great when viewing espn netflix youtube tutorial the ability to easily load and read my saved textbook within the amazon kindle app is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an ipad
just got home and found the packet is empty there is no product we ordered in it what do we do now
the kindle from best buy ha made it easier for me to read this is my first e reader i like the voyage for it brightness and speed plus thelarge variety of reading material i know amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase kindle book however i havefound several kindle book available for free from my public library i will no doubt buy some kindle book elsewhere in the future best buyhas been good to me i did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who wa well informed on this product but finally got what i wanted
still need refinement work well with some smart home item but need to be more nsistent also follow up question wonjust ntinue with the thought i feel it is something which may be truly amazing within a year

my grandson love it he play with it all the time love it
this is a great tablet and ereader together great for beginner is and all others my six year old son know how to work this
the paperwhite is an excellent ereader it is easy to use ha good battery power and is a good weight and size
this is probably one of the best box out there unfortunately they changed the new model the white indicator light doe not stay on to let you know the device is on did this in the previous model the power rd is extremely short should be an other foot longer change they made were not for the better but the device produce excellent p picture
i do not nsider myself a heavy reader i read a uple book every few month but i love my new kindle it is lighter than some of my book which is great but the best thing is that i can read at night in bed without disturbing my wife the e ink display allows you to also read outside in direct sunlight perfect for the upming summer month it is relaxing to just go out to a local park sit under a tree and read your new book if i had to find a fault with this kindle it would be the ad you re already paying a decent amount for an e reader then if you do not want ad on the lock screen you have to pay amazon more money they do not really bother me so it is not worth taking away a star they might bug you though so just keep that in the back of your mind before buying this that you will have to pay amazon to have them removed
this hold my grandson attention on a regular basis

we are having a lot of fun with the echo purchased for my boyfriend for christmas we have bought a uple of the smart outlet and it is very nvenient to say gameroom on and have the light and fireplace all me on without having to turn everything on a our hand are often full when entering the gameroom also have it connected to fitbit so if i do not have my phone and the fitbit is charging i can just ask how i m doing good weather report and news brief and the best part is you can just say stop when you do not want to hear any more nvenient saying aloud an item for a grocery or to do list then having it on your phone when you get to the store we have also enjoyed the music have it connected to speaker in the living room only drawback is it cannot answer a lot of thing one example i asked when the new bladerunner wa going to me out and it uld only give me info on the original show
i wa not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but i am impressed the inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier inch tablet i read negative review about the video quality but i have not had any issue and use it to watch netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality the amazon app store is definitely limited but with an android based system it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty
a must for someone who love to read great to carry arounnd
easy setup easily connected to our home harmony setup gave u a reason to get phillip hue light and uld not be happier alexa work great most of the time found location is key especially when playing tv alexa can sometimes not gear our voice due to location too close to speaker moved and work better always getting better echo can now call soon video with another device any echo product only amazon to amazon for now no cell phone

i have not used by new kindle very much yet you need character i do not have that much to say
the fire stick ha more than enough to offer in entertainment something for every one is taste the programming is not disappointing the equipment is inexpensive and you have ntrol of any other expense like subscription your bill will be far le than a cable bill and you will have more enjoyment from the program the only thing that need to be done is having local channel available without an antenna which may or may not help reception i also miss own

this is easy to set up and what i really like is with the ethernet connection there is rarely buffering
i purchased the echo for it is no on sale for my friend bought one at home depot and they gave refund i had mine for week but best buy would not give me a refund alexia is working great i am going to buy me the smaller echo at bed bath and beyond i get ff at home depot i get off
fire tv box is great for streaming show movie or music i connected it directly to internet rather than using wifi and have not had any issue with buffering
bought this for my mother she thought it would be good for calendar and reminder after setting up and installing a few extra apps she seems to enjoy it but mostly using it for music weather etc
i am glad that i bought the kindle paperwhite for my daughter it is easy to use and is perfect for reading anywhere
i love it easy to learn and operate quick response and easy to hook up
my son is crazy about it nice size good grafics and internet nection
alexa doe well with basic application hopefully amazon will ntinue to improve on it is ability to answer more in depth question besides the weather and play music
fun product that is very user friendly to operate
purchased this a an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite the backlight is greatly improved the display is of a higher quality the word are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker opening book and page flipping is noticeably speedier the one thing that doe annoy me about the rd generation paperwhite is the way it is manufactured when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen you can see a small section of the display vered in the e ink used to render the word and image on the rest of the screen at first i thought this wa a manufacturing defect so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model only to find that the send model had the same issue except more visible this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process when the paperwhite first came out it wa the crown jewel of amazon is e reader line and amazon wa careful to precision craft the device now that honor fall to the more expensive voyage with the paperwhite beming the flagship but still cheaper option in the kindle lineup meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced mpared to that of the voyage this wonbe a huge annoyance for some people it is for me and it is seriously made me nsider whether it is worth contacting amazon over for everyone else though this is a great e reader and well worth the money if you re looking for an e reader this is the one to buy
i may be slow to catch on to streaming i wa unaware of the depth of available medium material thing to nsider are internet download speed mb minimum and too many choice it is similar to the internet before the world wide web www some android apps such a kodi with fire tv guru make some of the material more easily accessible good luck
i didnwant to spend a fortune on something i just needed a quality tablet to read my book check email play on pinterest and twitter etc this price is phenomenal for the quality i actually bought one a a gift a few week later
easy to use with a ton of feature great resolution
great sound quality and with amazon prime great selection of music
we have a lot of fun with this product doe not always have the answer but we just have to phrase the question appropriately
this product work but work slow mpared to apple and some android phone tablet like i stated in my summary you pay for what you get no major issue thus far
awesome and reasonable this fire tv box pack enough punch for your viewing with more than adequate ntent that it will knock you out and for a rea onable price that you can afford
all around great speaker would definitly remmend
best buy ever for my year old only purchased because they were out of the galaxy tablet i m glad this tablet is perfect for my year old i love that it ha mode the kid mode sometimes freeze and take a minute for apps to open also didndownload netflix movie like indicated but regular mode work great my daughter love watching weird homemade youtube movie anyway
my grandson love his christmas gift and ha not put it down yet i will buy another for the other grandchild
my daughter love her kindle seems to keep her busy
got this for a family member who had on older kindle that stopped working they absolutely love it
i got this to specifically put in my kitchen to help me keep timer and nvert measurement the shopping list is an awesome addition a well whenever i finish something that i regularly use in my kitchen would definitely remmend for any ok and it is only going to get better with firmware update
other family member want same product
the amazon fire tablet start up and load application real fast and work wonderful the battery life is not a long a my fire hdx
how can you go wrong with a tablet on black friday deal i should of bought more when i had the chance
sorry nothing me to mind at this time i like the product
bought to replace our broken kindle reader good battery life and size much heavier than our old paper white easy to organize and find your document and book with wireless work smooth so far
it wa easy to set up and we have loved using it great for the whole family
have been using this item and it seems to be working quite well
love the fire perfect size very light i have it with me all the time
great product easy set up easy to hide but pleasant to look at work great but have not found any ntent that wa dolby digital picture is nice
nice size and easy to use and handy to take along with you
work very well mpatable with lot of program
i went back to buy two more for a nephew and aunt
everyone know kindle fire when these went on sale i grabbed a few up to use a kiosk for our pta little did i know that fire run a special operating system not a standard android the apps i needed to run were not available on kindle store after much research i found a work around but it wa very frustrating
rd cutter here we had been wanting to dump cable for some time but were scared to leave our mfort zone since we are prime member we finally decided to give amazon fire tv a shot we have been using fire tv for two week now and we ll never go back to cable pro ridiculously easy to set up and small form factor which take up very little space simple remote and a free app so you cannoturn your cell or tablet into a remote no buffering issue have yet me up although that may be because i have a very strong internet connection seamless interaction with our prime video acunt and amazon music across all device for example if i download a movie from prime on my tablet watch some of it during my mmute when i get home and turn on fire tv i can pick up right where i left off from my tablet seamlessly without having to manually sync me with thousand of channel apps loaded including all of the the major service we use can be used for game we have not tried any game yet the voice mmand feature is outstanding speak the name of a show or movie and be taken instantly to it with multiple option for buying renting or just viewing for free if available i have never been a big voice mmand user with other device but this one work so well that using it ha already beme a habit using the amazon photo app you can instantly upload all of your digital photo from your phone or tablet to your fire tv for large screen viewing of your photo n no way to customize the home screen layout at least no way that i have been able to figure out overall i m kicking myself for not doing this sooner since we use prime and amazon music it a no brainer for u to use the fire tv everything syncs automatically and transfer from device to device seamlessly edited to add the following section after reading some of the and star review if you are a first time rd cutter nsidering rd cutting or new to streaming tv service here are a few thing to keep in mind make sure you really take the time to do research and due diligence on rd cutting just google rd cutting to get started with several good article i m seeing a lot of and star reviewer who seemed surprised that they actually have to pay for thing like netflix hulu etc fire tv and all of the other streaming service like roku apple tv etc do not just give you free access to all ntent they allow you to pick and choose what you want to watch and pay for a opposed to making you pay a big fee for a huge amount of channel you will never watch if you do it right you ll have access to the ntent you want for a substantial saving over what you were paying with cable make sure you have a strong and fast internet connection this is very important we dumped our cable mpany in it entirety including internet service and upgraded to a faster dedicated line internet service with another mpany we have up to six device simultaneously streaming at any given time in our house and our internet service can handle all of that a well a the streaming fire tv so make sure yours can a well if you re not sure call your internet service provider tell them you are planning to switch to streaming television and ask them about your current speed some apps require a cable subscription you can purchase a streaming service like sling which will bundle several of the channel you likely want but you may find yourself unable to access certain apps for now password sharing with one of your friend may solve that problem but i suspect it only a matter of time before that loophole get closed so do your research and make sure you can access the channel you want give yourself time to adjust to the new interface it took some getting used to when i lost my ability to surf the cable channel guide but the fact is i m no longer wasting large chunk of time mindlessly surfing the guide rather than surf i m turning to specific apps to watch specific program it liberating in a way that i didnexpect besides i can now surf all of the amazon prime ntent by simply using the voice mmand on the remote
great tablet especially for the price i didnknow exactly what i would use this for when first purchased but have found many ol u
love the light this tablet is great if u just want to read
we love this alexa is so intelligent and our son love her also you get a disunt on amazon music you can hook the echo up to tv light and more just tell her what you want her to do
this wa a great christmas present for my daughter
we originally had a fire stick and still use it with another tv once we subscribed to sling it seemed like streaming became more unreliable increased buffering we made two purchase to improve the situation a fire tv and a wi fi booster the two together definitely remedied the streaming issue but the increased video crispness i we give all the credit to fire tv
i bought this to replace a damaged much more expensive tablet of my daughter great item and just a nice a the more expensive one she absolutely love it
i enjoy readi g and facebook using this item i also purchased my husband one
we got our year old an amazon fire for christmas the screen wa broken a uple month ago she liked it so well that she used her own money and bought a new one
a advertised work with nest spotify just wish it would work when on volume highest with voice mmand
plenty of capability for e mail game and other app is they each have one now and love them more than the standard tablet
i bought this to replace my satellite but have not done it yet it is laggy at time and ha connection issue the remote loo connection often and doe not connect back until battery are removed a bit hard to navigate with the remote it work well if all you want is to get kodi but it is kind off difficult for a newbie with prime subscription it is great
we are having so much fun with the echo alexa play our favorite music we have saved in our libraryfinds new song give u news update and weather report i know she doe much more but we have not had the time to experiment the sound quality is great after we bought ours i bought a send one for a christmas gift
love the echo great addition to the house will do everything you need
nfortable easy to use work great with any light
this device is kid friendly and is amazing for kid that do not like to read
my kid enjoy the fire hd and they love the picture quality
it amazing super fast in response and will provide access to all your amazon ntent if you are a prime member this is a must imo
small and lightweight i would not really remmend for teenager or adult more so for kid under
good for reading and apps i use it a well a my teenage son easy to use but now wishing i purchased the next size up
the app for that doe not work well i have not used it that much just for news
bought the echo to use with my alarm m security system a a voice regnition interface did not expect to see my friend and family also buy one for other reason great product price too high
i love this tablet it so simple and easy to use happy with how long the battery last after watching amazon video for hour
i bought one from bestbuy instead of buying one that is jail broke that is a moral choice for me that being said i can add the apps i want the hardest part so far is getting used to not having a dvr and not being able to fast fwd through mmercials but i m saving over month over cable including the month of apps that i m currently buying
replacement charger for my son is kindle work great highly remmended
i wa expecting something more intuitive moving to google
this is a nice tablet for it price and size thanks
currently building a house and went ahead and purchase the echo to start building my smart home we currently use it for just the basic stuff right now music timer weather random question and love it my year old daughter love being able to tell alexa to play her favorite song so she can dance i plan to purchase a uple of mpatible thermostat next a well a some smart plug that work with alexa
alexa is pleasant polite very quick to respond to request such a weather music or even joke
enjoy how easy it is to set up and use since i enjoy old movie this unit is good for a movie lover like me
love the streaming capability on this item really save a lot with the increasing st of cable
i thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store i have owned a kindle since the send generation version this is by far my favorite the look and feel are amazing i do not regret the purchase one bit a i have the disposable inme to do so but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point
lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light
i got this to ntrol my hue lightbulb and it work great surprised at how fast it is
when i fist walked into best buy i thought i wa going to get my son a new samsung i wa nervous about spending that much on a first tablet for a send grader the sale rep pointed me to the kindle and i m glad he did
the sound ming from the echo is amazing nsidering it is small size
amazon ntinues to improve alexa the product ha unlimited potential
i love my kindle wish it had more memory but overall it is the best electronic thing i have purchased for myself
this is a great little toyota to have the speaker sound great
tablet easy to use and is great for face book internet watching movie and reading price wa great
my son is already each had one got one for my husband great value and all are reading more than they ever did
very intuitive to use work great with the amazon esystem
my wife and i love the amazon echo it is very easy to use
nice easy to use tablet for a good price
friend at work had been telling me about the fire box and fire stick for quite some time finally decided to get one and glad i did with netflix amazon video and specific channel i think i m going to cancel my cable subscription definitely remmend
excellant starter tablet i love that it is preset with child in mind
it doe what it wa advertised to do not the easiest item to use other than that it work great
bought this for my wife and she love it this wa our third kindle over a period of many year cannot go wrong for the price
great price great tablet for kid remmend the tablet
i have had kindles over the year got to have one to read my book relax
the paperwhite is an excellent product it is very lightweight easy to hold for long period of time and user friendly software wise be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet or amazon fire this is because of the e ink however i will take the trade off a you are able to read e ink in every environment sunlight dark room without any eyestrain something that is not possible with a regular tablet screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this if you have a prime membership you have access to all of amazon is library which ha a large selection however most disappointingly you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to amazon is kindle app which is an additional month i find this to be mildly frustrating however you are able to rent book from your local library whenever you would like overall i think the paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading with only a few drawback i enjoy reading on it very much
i love the voice mmand and online resource
nice tablet function well great item for surfing the web easy to use and set up yes i would remmend
upgraded from an old nd gen kindle and this is much better
the echo is a machine that doe what it say the speaker is similar to my bluetooth speaker the mmands are easy and i find myself using alexa many time a day much better responsiveness than siri on my phone
real easy to use great price got of them one for me and one for my friend son he u it to download free book to read and game to play
great price fast delivery will be buying from best buy again
definitely enjoying this my year old u alexa to play all the music he want downside is there is no official youtube app or youtube kid other than that i dig it
great deal for an entry amazon tablet unbeatable entry level tablet for use in the amazon e system
bought this tablet for my son and he ha loved it it is so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental ntrols
i find this product to be great on plane ride due to extended battery life and great section of reading material
alexa is like talking to ur self but with google knowledge and answer back
the wife and kid love it thinking of buying another one
just what you d expect nstruction is solid the interface is intuitive screen is very readable and the unit fit well in the hand and is mfortable to hold for a long time when you get hooked on a great read
it a lot different from the roku but it get the fob done
we did a lot of research when looking for a streaming device to use on an outside television a we didnwant to add another cable box amazon fire tv wa the best option it is so nvenient and easy to use the voice mmands are excellent it also ha several apps that are unavailable on apple tv that we truly enjoy such a tcm it also ha usb port available we highly remmend amazon fire tv for anyone searching for a streaming device
beautiful picture enjoying different apps and looking forward to hour of fun
wife u it every day and say she love it very happy with the purchase
my kid liked it very much it is a good worth tab
i love my kindle it make it so much easier to read book instead of having to carry them with me
i had a kindle before and then for reason unfathomable to me the kindle seemed to erase everything when i had unexpected trouble logging in with my password that wa the end of the kindle then i splurged on a fire and bam everything came back even better than before
very happy that i can finally view hdr ntent on amazon and netflix with this only gripe i have is navigating thru this software is a little nfusing not too bad though
best buy had a sale on the firetv and i jumped at it i wa most interested in the speed increase over our firetv stick i have been very pleased with the upgrade i like having a microphone on the remote to do voice search or now alexa mmands turn on the light trigger ifttt script the speed over launching a navigate apps is much improved we have been using p vue a good bit very pleased
i love the size and light weight easy to set up easy to use lightening quick download
i wanted a tablet that wa a decent screen size that uld play game that uld stream movie netflix prime that uld check e mail that uld skype etc all while remaining affordable under i have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these thing effortlessly while remaining this affordable this tablet ha handled whatever i throw at it and with no hiccup i had the cheaper fire tablet prior to this one and that thing wa slow to process the most basic task if you re looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do then pick this one up
i use it for listening to music when i m trying to study i use it to catch me up on news and also to turn off my light great personal assistant wish it supported more application phone integration
i had purchased a google home first and wa disappointed that google home would not play my music that i had uploaded to google play the amazon echo will play uploaded music to amazon would remmend this over google home however i am sure that they will update the google home to be able to play uploaded music since it just came out
amazon fire tv from best buy wa my send fire tv purchase in a week after trying the tv service i ordered a nd one on line from best buy picked it up in store within an hour the price matched the st one but the hdmi cable wa extra when i am used to using fire tv i will turn the cable service off amazon is alexa assistant is phenomenal for me is better than apple is siri this wa probably the best online purchase pick up in store experience i have had
i cannot say enough about the amazon tap i enjoy playing music from it and that it is portable i can play music from my amazon prime acunt pandora or from my phone it is fun to ask alexa question yes alexa cannot answer all my question or find everything i ask for but it is still amazing
my kid loved hers so much that i bought one for my son wonderful and easy for the kid
i used to read late at night with a bed light that kept my husband awake after i started using the backlit kindle paperwhite my husband exclaimed no more white night
bought it to use with my wemo device and it work like a charm alexa is my new best friend
i used a uple of the brand that are just priced under this product and well you get what you pay for this tablet wa much easier for my granddaughter to learn on she can access her camera picture video and game much better than the other brand
i enjoy using my amazon echo i love how alexa cannoturn off and on my light lol
bought it for my son a a replacement for his damaged tablet what a great deal this is i recmend it fully
it so small it easy to get lost under your tv it very fast and easy to use log in to your amazon acunt and netflix and hulu and you have ton of option right at your fingertip have not really used alexa all that much so not sure how well it work overall the phone app remote work pretty well so that is nice when you cant find the tiny fire tv remote too lazy to look for it some of the apps do not work all that great do not utilize surround sound but the main one do got it on sale for definitely worth this price
no home automation yet but will add some soon great for music speaker sound is really good and work great for u have not used alexa to buy directly but see that will probably happen very pleased with the purchase
this is a fantastic tablet and only st cannot beat it it ha ad but they re not obnoxious would definitely remmend it
so far it is great this wa a gift she is get this on today
i bought this when it wa on sale for a christmas gift for a child in foster care i think this is a great tablet for kid but wish there wa more storage a you know with kid they like to download stuff it is a great first tablet for someone who is just getting started
i bought one for my son for his birthday loved it so much i bought a send one for my self
still exploring the possibility i bought it a a sort of addition to my kindle e reader since i am not a total subscriber to the connected lifestyle i will be exploring capability slowly my only mplaint is the battery life is not by a factor of at least a good a on my kindle e reader
so i wa looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job a guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it wa awesome i loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such it portable it got clean and crisp sound it also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i wa in the basement with the speaker and it wa still connected it very easy to use i have no mplants about this speaker at all
perfect item for my grand kid and the price wa especially just what i needed
easy setup and seamless streaming would like to see amazon upgrade this item to k
of fav charger
amazon nailed it it readability is superior to the book the new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version and btw you can carry a library with you wherever you go
keep my kid busy while i ok when in the car
this is awesome the updated feature work well really fast an smooth the light dimming is great the best feature on the new kindle
just what my kid needed for a road trip easy to setup love it
i like that the reader ha a backlight for reading at night
this smart box doe exactly what it say it doe i like that it add the pic and video from my cell phone in an easy to use app
i bought this so that i uld read in the bedroom without waking my infant and without bright light shining right in my eye i m so glad i bought it and the battery life is amazing
it is only st dollar and it is very good for day to day usage the only little thing i experienced it is a bit slow sometimes
we love the echo decent speaker and easy to take outside

gift for my husband who hate reading on the ipad he love this so much better
i love my device but wish there wa more of a descriptive summary of how to get music station and a well a other feature i have learned most by just ming upon thing need better operating instruction

this wa a birthday present and although a friend had talked to me about getting one i had no idea how great it would be to have one it is easy to set up and we find ourselves asking alexa question that we would normally spend the extra time looking up online
bought this to view movie and show online worked out pretty good so far
for me the kindle black wa not a good fit for me there are time i read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping this model doe not have a back light so i m unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband so i returned and went for a kindle fire
great device good quality sound in a speaker super nvenient

great little lap top with touch screen absolutely ruin you
it is a great tablet for kid and great video look great and lorful

i had been looking for something to watch my amazon prime and this give me an easy way to do it plus netflix hbo and more easy plug and go make it good to move from room to room easily
run smoother then the fire stick love the idea of picking and paying for only the channel i want
bought this kindle almost year ago and it is still going strong
great little tabletthat ha all the feature of a regular size tablet fast hd vibrant lor in all
while generally a minor upgrade from the paperwhite it is just the best e reader on the market x ray seemed unnecessary until i wa reading game of throne and forgot who certain people were the choice to swipe or pinch to change page is nice too it is a great device though if you re on a budget you would do fine with the last version
heard about this from a friend best buy answered all my question enjoy the product
love this product it doe everything answer question play my music from iphone play game tell joke etc
alexa rock know everything never talk back a perfect roommate
after using one at a relative is house i finally decided to purchase one of these i have struggled with the slowness of smart tv built in apps or even the apps on my bluray player and this wa finally the solution to that it is fast and ha ton of ntent
if you actually paid for this adapter you re out of your mind
give a good quality being that it is a poloroid camera
doe the job perfectly thanks
this device is very innovative and fun to use and some learning curve on how to use voice mmand it speaker can be improved though it is a bit deep base lack of manual ntrol and hope the upgrade will include more feature and mpatible with google overall very good product
good buy for the price easy to surf the web a lot of apps in the app store
excellent new kindle fire tablet this one better ha camera camrder and more organized
it is just amazing what alexa can do what great entertainment for people of all age
my send one and work better than the first one
we purchased this for my wife is mother she like to play game on it and do some reading
i will be ordering amazon fire for my two granddaughter because they love nana is so much
the speaker voice quality is terrible mpare the similar size my logitech ue boom the price is too high even i got on promotion with
got this for my nephew and he love it hard to get him to put it down
simply the best the fire stick is also a great deal but for flawless connectivity fire tv is worth the extra green back
this tablet is amazing in low budget which ha all good stuff like dual camera memory and free amazon underground application
you cannotell it to do ol thing and have it also turn of light etc
great alternative to cable i have purchased these for several of my family member i have a inch k tv and the picture is clear the device is user friendly and can get many apps
okay so i am a slow adopter of using kindle reader but i have made stupendous use of this since buying it i use it at work for keeping up to date with business journal and reading book on management style and skill even my original intent wa for use at work i find myself reading additional book for my personal entertainment more often screen is very easy to read in varying light nditions and menu is easily navigated i am thinking of buying more of these for gift at work for my employee at christmas time
i have had an older version of this kindle and i really like it i decided to buy one for my sister a we share a love of reading she wa very surprised and immensely pleased
it is a great product i suggest that other people buy it
use it to listen to the amazon prime music all the time
product is great plenty storage for lot of book
purchased a christmas gift for grandchild who love both music and gadget
very easy to set up and operate the voice mmand is especially nice when playing music and so far i have found the music library to be quite large with a good selection if you use amazon at all i would remmend the prime membership a it pay for itself quickly and drastically increase the available ntent in the medium library no i m not an amazon employee
this medium streamer is good i like the voice feature
great e reader long battery life wa hesitant to make the change from actual book to an e reader but i have no regret
bought for my wife a a replacement for a fire purchased a few year ago she like this better
i love my firetv we have a firestick in every room and added the firetv box to our new k tv awesome
great idea will remmend to everyone just cannot stop playing with it
got this a a gift for my mother and she is satisfied
i wa looking for a larger tablet than my kindle fire and wa on the fence that the kindle fire would be too large much to my surprise it ha been an easy adjustment while larger the video viewing is better and the magazine reading is much easier on the eye although i miss my for my book reading a the seems too big i am happy overall with the new tablet
i like it it keep my granddaughter business and great apps too
bought for kid to play game on good for what they need it
i love the parental ntrols available you can set what time they can start and stop using a well a how much time on each activity also love the guarantee of replacement
this wa exactly what we needed no if it uld only make me a sandwich
we recently purchased this a a gift for charity we chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and uld not be more please it is very easy set up and super user friendly i would def remmend this for a child rather than a more expensive product
i love how easy it is to use alexa we use it mostly for music
i own an apple tv also and ntent is just a good very easy to navigate i also use my phone is app to navigate thru the menu
great ncept and easy for kid to use but it doe take a lot of set up in many different area to work like you want it to you cannot just plug it in and go
i no longer ha a cable tv bill with the exception of high speed internet fire tv ha helped in lower my monthly expense to mcast
i gave it a a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an amazon paperwhite i thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it ha been she love it

i love the amazon fire tv it is easy to use and setup i use this almost everyday trying to cut the rd this make it easy to do

this amazon fire tv box work a advertised it wa a breeze to set up and took me about five minute to figure out how to use the feature and function
love the fact i can watch amazon prime with out video to voice delay
alexa wake me up every morning and with out having to turn light on to see clock can just ask alexa what time is it plus can do so much more such a play song from play list etc worth the money
this is easy to use i also have a roku and i think i like this better it took me a few minute to get use to the difference from the roku remote to the fire remote but now it awesome
these are great tablet for anyone wanting to get into the tablet game a friendly ui for just about anyone not to mention for the price and being able to add an sd card for additional memory make this a great tablet

this wa my send purchase of this style and brand of tablet my first one unfortunately met with a accident and needed replaced this tablet ha front and rear facing camera addable storage and extreme ease of accessability love it
i thought it would be a hassle to set up it wa easy i thought it might feel creepy i like her i got it primarily for music know that if you purchase amazon is unlimited music via alexa it is first month free then thereafter you do not get that deal online and you do not have to be a prime member which i find too expensive i m also thrilled that i can get my pandora station which i think is not the case with google is version there are some thing she doe not understand but sometimes rewording help several interesting skill to call upon fun i like it
bought this tablet for our year old she love to watch video of nursery rhyme and bubble guppy i can finally get some housework done without interruption so user friendly even a year old can figure it out

i have a smart tv but netflix and all the other apps take too long to load with the fire tv they load faster and when watching series movie the chapter load automaticly a with with my smart tv i have to select every single tittle it felt kind of a headache some time but with the fire tv n more and the picture look great
the tablet is a great value and resource for our kid
i mpared this with the google home for a few week we like that we can add item to our joint gmail calendar and add item to our shopping list with ease not a fan that you need amazon prime to play any song you want but syncing other music source are pretty easy and make up for this it lack asking for fact that google home tends to answer with more ease we are adding automated lighting this week looking forward to seeing how this work hope they keep upgrading it to keep adding new automation device pretty fun and useful tool it ha proven to be just added an echo dot for upstairs too also to note adding the alexa and any do app to our iphones ha helped improve the usefulness of the device also
we love the parent ntrols and durability we would definitely buy another
durable and great tablet to handle and navigate camera quality is good to be used by a year old great child feature
we bought one for my wife and my mother in law and they both love it very easy to use

my wife broke her kindle so we tried the fire and she ha loved it
you are able adjust the brightness which is good
it really is helpful to have this tablet around it is really good for it price but the camera is not so good but it still is a great deal
user friendly and perfect for my three year old daughter
great to listen to music and get news during the day
got my amazon fire table and love it it is really easy to use battery last long
i bought this for my year old for christmas i set it up and then wrapped it so it ready to play a soon a it is unwrapped free apps are good some l get on my android are not available here school website dont work wish i had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase
i love the size of this it is the size of a book the only thing i do not like is the lock screen ha ad
i wa looking for an inexpensive tablet for my child to learn on and found that they had dropped the price of the kindle fire to this is an unbelievable price for a tablet with this many feature
what is there to say but that i love it function well and last a long time
i have had nothing but great experience with alexa everything work a expected the sound quality is good a well a the speech regnition i would remmend it highly
work great this tablet ha a great picture and move much quicker than i expected
it is a good starter tablet i have not been overly impressed but it doe what it need to do
portable good battery life easy to read in pretty much any light it doe not have all the frill like the kindle fire but if all you re looking to do is read this is what you need
doe so much at a voice mmand music news weather answer question but becareful it doe not distinguish voice so someone uld buy something and charge it to your prime or credit acunt
my wife like it because she can read all different kind of book
i purchased this device a a gift and i got a positive review from many source it is good for the eye and doe what it is intended for price uld be little bit cheaper other wise there is no mplain amazon kindle ha a lot of source for book
with this amazing toy you wonneed to pay for outrageous monthly cable bill just buy this and no more cable bill
awesome speaker and home automation ntrol very remmended
after reading both positive and negative review took the plunge because it wa on sale and wanted k had a little difficulty setting up scrolling the onscreen keyboard inputing password because the remote didnwork properly out of the box after the system updated the firmware no more problem after moving the unit to another house wa not dfficult setting up on that network some reviewer said that the menu is too amazon centric doe have a lot but no problem downloading and using other streaming service crackle youtube etc k limited ntent but quality seems okay on a k tv need a fast connection ha an app it uld be better if you do not need k and have an idevice house apple is box would be a more mpatible choice
the amazon fire are super to use you can do more than read a book on them
it a great tablet it easy to use and connect to wifi
these thing are ol with the new muti room music option i can have the same song playing in each room not to mention the interm great item
very nice tablet for the price built in storage is limited but easily expandable with a microsd card the freetime app for kid is excellent overall i would remmend this tablet
i had an original kindle wifi only and loved it however wa limited when reading at night i didnwant to have to attach a light or use a flashlight the kindle paperwhite solves my dilemma i would specifically remmend it for those who are frequent flier
reliable with great memory and storage excellent battery life would remmend to young and old
alexa is great to use her regnition is good and if you have spotify and pandora acunts you can really get a lot out of it and light outlet kit saying alexa turn on the living room feel exquisitely dorky plus it is the only way to order the dot which is essentially the top of this speaker after a week with the echo i purchased dot for other room again to get the most out of this you need to own kindle book have a spotify acunt and preferably audible unlimited
i like the ntrast it is easy to read on outside
absolutely love this tablet it so much more than i thought it would be fadt easy to use and set up for a tablet virgin i love the kid profile setting up a time limit for the day and a curfew time tablet shuts off and wa simple to do movie book game entertainment web browsing and much much more i highly remmend this device for first timer and the experienced alike do it get one my only regret is that i didnt get two
bought for my daughter for middle school reading it is perfect
bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that wa on recall the amazon esystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well i like the option for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goal are met first unit need more on board memory however make sure to buy an sd card to expand
great for child nonexpensive very durable easy to use
the amazon fire tablet is an excellent product i primarily use it to purchase and read book from kindle also i use it for my facebook activity the battery life is long and it recharges quickly my year old son also enjoys using it i would highly remmend this product to others
i got this stuff for myself to watch netflix youtube
this is a good alternative for those who do not like the chromecast not great for plex but regular streaming and navigation are very good
without the light thermostat or alarm that you would attach to the echo doe not seem like a practical thing if you plan on having the other item to connect then it would probably be a better device for you again solid device i just do not have use for it daily
this product is awesome you can play your favorite music instantly also had great fun asking alexa question some serious some funny we love it
the grandkids love it they spend time playing the game they like
work ok doe not shutdown properly notified amazon tried to fix over the phone they wanted to replace it but i said i would put up with a hard shutdown
i have had so much fun with my echo and there are so many more thing i want to explore with it love the weather report setting timer playing music my wife ha enjoyed it even my mom want one
she love this tablet it work well unlike her bargain tablet which she tried to use previously and st about the same she like the sound of it also she enjoys the free game she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it
once i finish making my house a smart house this is gonna be amazing love it for playing music right now

okay this tablet ha it limit it is not an ipad but for buck it doe a lot if you have amazon prime it is awesome if you do not it is still nice it is fast and ha good battery life you can side load apps if you cannot find them in the amazon app store overall i m impressed with the feature
our daughter had asked for the paperwhite for christmas and she wa delighted when she opened it she used it for hour every day so we view this a a really proper gift
i didnexpect to receive a premium tablet but with this device it is great i got more than i bargained for great job amazon
i bought the kindle paper white for travel it so much lighter than bulky book and can fit in your hand luggage pocket to read while travelling so easy to use no screen glare like tablet have so you can read it anywhere ha adjustable screen brightness and font size too ha the technology to allow you to order and download book from anywhere you happen to be i love it so much i bought my sister one too

i love my kindle it is user friendly and there is so much more than i thought

i purchased the echo with the dream of ntrolling my ebee thermastat with my voice after getting it and looking into the vast amount of skill you can add to it it ha beme one of the purchase of the year for my household
after long review decided to buy the fire tablet a a gift for a great frienday she love it it is the perfect size and ha all the feature she wa looking for in a tablet happy birthday
i wa happy with the echo but because i m all google i returned and went with the google home a far a the echo the speaker wa really good picked up my voice from everywhere around my apartment google home doe not do a good a alexa it a great toy for anyone
just a litte slow but other then that it wa great

the paper white screen is super clear and easy on the eye making reading a pleasure in any light the touch ntrols are intuitive and easy to learn book load fast the battery life ha been great if you re looking for an ebook this is it
doe just what it say easy to set up and use great alternative to cable

if you have amazon prime these tablet are a must
love it i wish it would have worked with my iphone overall very satisfied
great system for streaming playstation vue service very responsive alexa is a plus kudos amazon
not a bad tablet for the price iris skittle different from other tablet brand
i wa in need of a new small speaker for music in the kitchen the echo ha been a surprisingly awesome addition to my home you know that best friend in llege you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tape you had ever seen with my prime acunt through amazon i have spent untless hour playing music long forgotten amazon play insert artist here and i am rennected to old music and exposed to new i love asking amazon about the weather while making my ffee the sound quality is fantastic there is so much that the echo can do that i have yet to explore i started using the grocery list this morning and feel like there is more and more to get out of my echo i will be buying an echo for my folk soon and my teenager love it star
this ver is a must have for your kindle reading device i purchased a different case initally and had to me back to get this case it is so handy to close when reading so your screen is always protected the kindle is secure locked into the case so you do not have to worry about it falling if you buy a kindle you must this case
we love it so much fun for everyone in the family we happen to have the nest thermostat after a few try is i figured it out played some of the skill with my grandkids it a just great fun
alexa is a helpful tool to use everyday she get better the more skill you have her learn
good sound quality charging dock is an added advantage
most apps you have to pay for basic apps like youtube will not download without inputting credit card information what tablet for child not plausible to put in credit card information
the amazon fire tv is amazing i highly remmend
just love my new tablet i have had a kindle fire for year and it wa messing up badly so i needed a new one badly
nice for kid like the free apps built in the device can ntrol what and how long they get to use screen time
amazon make a good inexpensive talent for basic function
i love the fire tvits great to stream netflix amazon it also let u download game
we just love this product i have to buy a uple echo dot nest it work and that is all you need i add new skill from the alexa app and they work good and will buy some wemo outlet and hue to add ntrols for my lighting in the house it can only get better a new gen of this product me out
tho is awesome doe everything it say and more only thing is it not portable but amazon sell a aftermarket charger base that make it portable
gave this gift to my girlfriend dad for christmas and he absolutely loved it
i wa resistant to buying an amazon fire because i thought my smart tv and cable box were doing a great job however now that i have tried it i m planning to add one to the other tv is in the house it is seamless and so fast and the ability to just talk to the remote instead of typing is awesome we nstantly use it now for streaming amazon netflix hbo youtube and more seriously thinking about cutting cable tv out of our budget altogether
this tablet is excellent i use it on the uch inthe bedroom and in the car too i simplty love it
i bought this a a christmas present for my year old niece she love it she is nsistently checking her facebook and playing game from all the apps she a love it
i really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didnmake it a keeper for me
i have purchase of the amazon fire tv model black
i do not really care about the built in amazon apps i use this tablet for xfinity tv streaming and it work great since it is amazon i do not expect them to abandon update like the cheap chinese tablet it is not speedy fast but for the money it is hard to beat
my year old daughter saved up to by this her brother bought the gb about a year earlier so new she needed more space the o is a bit clunky and le intuitive then on higher priced tablet but tough to beat the price speed is not great for web or certain gaming apps but fine for book parental ntrols are helpful but take time to figure out and require more step than seem necessary to change overall ok first tablet for kid nsidering the price for adult fine for e book and very basic apps otherwise best to pay up for better quality and o efficiency
function a expected
i bought my wife one she bought me one a few week later and now i m going to buy my mamma one great on the go take to work and business trip device my little girl love learning on the kid abc and loring app
my wife ha an older paperwhite that still function very well we decided to get this one for my daughter because she is a book worm it is worked great and she love it
dollar ac to usb power adapter for buck
my niece love her kindle tablet she u it all the time
work great in my entertainment setup my only real mplaint is that you cannot ntrol it directly using an echo currently using a harmony hub
great price great screen and resolution easy to use and good performance for le than
work well work just like the fire stick but better because you can plug a ethernet cable for a better connection
wa easy to set up and very easy to use for a basic tablet i would remmend it
brought this small reader for my mom who wanted something larger than her phone to do pintrest and read on she love it
all the show and one third of the price of cable
bought for grandkids learning to read have found lot of kid book they love them
if you have hulu netflix amazon prime etc get this because you can ntrol all of them from this device it is awesome and faster than the fire stick and you can play game too gotta get the game ntroller totally worth it
i bought two of these kindles for two grandson they are very good with electronic item even though they are young
i love this for it is music capability great sound easy function
i wa looking for a kid tablet for my grandson but this one is so much better because it can grow with him and it ha a kid mode on it which is really nice so he cannot order or go online without permission he love this tablet and it is very well build
i bought of the amazon fire tablet because the sale guy said that they were great and ran really fast i have very fast internet and this thing just barely chug along if you play a game it nstantly stall and freeze the sound quality when i play music is terrible i wa planning on buying one for each of my niece and nephew if they ran well but now i know that would not work for them because they are horrible
purchased a a gift and the owner love the functionality and size of the tablet
my view me from being only a ipad user and my purchase purpose wa for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my ipad to watch youtube cartoon and she operates it very well i m giving this star because i m returning this in le than hour so i didngive this much of a chance first it seems it really want you to sign up for amazon free time month guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if i did that so created the child profile on the tablet moved the youtube app to the profile opened the app and got selection for popular music movie etc uld not locate a search feature after repeated tapping got music to open only to get a warning that this ntent is restricted in the amazon free time app what so i have to join to unlock youtube i m technically savy so the fact that i wa frustrated didnbear well for the granddaughter maybe there wa another way around this but i didnlook should not have to uple this with the random ad for game amazon prime etc that pop up and that wa enough for me so going back to get a window tablet where you click on the youtube app you get what you are expecting without restriction for the price i had to try this but not for me
in my search for a wireless speaker i looked at various model and decided on this one because of the portability the look and how it synced with alexa i have an alexa and this product wa spot on the sound is great i use it in the balny and stream all music from pandora different station and the quality is great definitely would remmend
i had the original kindle and still use it but this new one is a delight the screen is very bright and touchable this make it easier to read and also to turn page

simply put it exactly what i expected i have had zero problem with it

alexa ha been a great addition to my new home never having dealt with any smart home device and wanting to start i found alexa user friendly and the additional apps and service a nice touch cannot wait to see what new tech and feature alexa ha to offer in the future
worth the money use it all the time with no issue
i love my kindle i have gotten so spoiled that if i cannot get a book on my kindle i do not read it
really fun and informative question are sometimes nfusing to the device and it answer bizarrely
it is slick and small and it work great i love it
i love this tablet i got it for my grandson and the minute he me through the door he want his tablet it keep him busy
fast fluid and lot of apps especially once i added the google play store very simple to do and doe not require anything that void the warranty display is sharp and video and game load quickly i deducted one star a amazon is version of android lack the ability of customization
not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child but it is a kindle they can grow into it a well and from studying up on the product before hand i wa able to determine that they have excellent customer service that is a big plus
this is a great product and best buy make it easy i cant think of any other product that can fullfill the purpose of my use awesome
got this for only really great deal for this machine i just love to read and it is more fun reading with this kindle i have been waiting for deal like this for a long time and will buy another one a a gift next time the deal is on
i think amazon fire tv ha more to offer than apple tv really good easy to use

great bang for your buck thats the first thing that me to your mind when you hold the tablet it feel solid it work great and doesnt feel cheap at all i have experience number of low st tablet and you feel them the moment you hold them agree you cannot mpare to ipad mini or other mparable brand tablet but at this price point i am not at all hesitant to gift someone i cant put my head around how are they able to offer such great quality at this price simply amazing
i love this paper white it is light weight easy to use and the battery last for a very long time with use i only wish it were cheaper but the price wa not bad
amazing deal good product i am satisfied

bought a fire tv player to replace an aging p work a advertised alexia can be a little quirky at time however

i bought this in thanksgiving day it is good for the price
can not do without my kindle fire i had an earlier model year ago it is still going just wanted a backup
i started out crazy hesitant about the product seeming skeptical of the voice regnition being overdramatized it hears me while a song is very loud a well a the information pre downloaded is awesome just for music alone it is awesome everything else which is not able to be explained is far beyond worth the money it is an underpriced item and i plan to buy more
kid will love this tablet ha a camera and kid can make movie with it wonderful for a child with a good imagination
bought this a a birthday gift for my year old dad and he love it even though he is tech savvy no need to be to setup or use
i brought this tablet for myself good product especially for what i paid for it got it on sale for on black friday online very happy i didnhave to wait in line at the store
alexa is way more fun and practical than i thought she would be she is not anywhere near a smart a ok google but she sound a thousand time better and i m really happy to have her shopping disunts hue ntrol music sres and weather she ll even read your kindle book to you i find myself saying thank you after she doe something and yeah i asked her to marry me
my daughter u this and love it the only mplaint she had wa she cannot get game from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the amazon store and amazon doe not have all the game but a far a working it doe what it is supposed to
perfect for my house it a space saver for me plus it various feature just are value add to my reading
handy
echo is wonderful it understands spoken language very well i love how it is mpatible with ifttt it can do just about anything
it is exactly what you d think it would be no more no le a perfect e reader for traveling and backpacking
it is nice but there are too many specific line to remember to get her to talk to you also your family gmail calendar doe not connect if on icloud with iphones so she will not know your family calendar need update and she should be able to answer you by a question and not a specific way you must say thing with the skill
it is a great product for entertaining love alexa on this but wish it would work with the echo
only those who have an amazon acunt can work with this tablet
bought this for my year old granddaughter and she love it it ha all the book apps video that she need to learn and play i love it cause she play on it and leaf mine alone â º it ha everything on it and i can set parental guide best buy ever

this device is a nice starter tablet for kid the fire o with freetime unlimited free for year is an excellent environment the warranty is great and had we kept the device i m sure we would have had the opportunity to use it however the device we received in the kid edition box wa not registered a a kid edition with amazon thus the freetimeunlimited plan only lasted day and the kid edition warranty did not apply amazon uld not register the fire a a kid edition so it wa returned

this is a entry level ereader that only allows you to read in the day you will not be able to read in the dark
these fire tv box are a bit bigger then the fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory there is virtually no lag when using the standard fire apps and only a small amount when using rd party apps kodi there are ton of tutorial online to get the most out of your fire tv
lightweight and i like being able to read outside with no glare
my wife i love alexa is music capability alexa is great help with setting reminder putting appointment on the calendar we think alexa is fantastic
i purchased this for my wife to replace her old fire she love the additional new feature camera video and the extra memory seems to speed thing up for her happy wife happy life

the echo is a nice and quick addition to finding weather forecast sport is sres also we use it daily for serving a our radio
alexa is so much better than siri more natural and faster
my wife and i both love our kindles easy to use and easy on the eye much better than reading on a normal tablet
not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up not a big fan of the online tutorial had a really hard time in powering it off camera setting did not take very good picture did not like the multiple ad on it every time i used it finally it locked up on me and i had a hard time getting it to go to setting so i uld do anything with it probably will be returning this product to best buy
i can watch anything any time my daughter like it
right out of the box it didnwork we took it back and the geek squad uld not get it to work either great disappointment for my year old boy since it wa a christmas gift
this wa a great purchase bought for my son for his birthday and the whole family love it
i have tried all of the fire tv and i have to say this one is the best especially if you have a k tv i bought this to go with my k tv and i have to say it doe snot disappoint there is a lot of k hdr ntent out there and this is a good place to get a lot of it i highly remmend getting this version if you are on the lookout for the best
already own one loved it so much bought a a gift for my mother in law for christmas on black friday for cannot beat that
very helpful for keeping fitness health and weight goal
so i have been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review is about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really disurage me you really do not know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime free trial i wa shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged for a full year of prime one day before my trial wa supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync is to other echo device a well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental ntrols and or password to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it star your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if it right for you good luck in your decision
this product did not disappoint me i purchased it on the deal of the day and do not regret it for a send great sound quality and unbelievably accurate with voice mmands
my mom life her tablet she is obsessed with it

great product great service and best item i have purchased in year
star bc the voice regnition need improvement other than that it is amazing we use it for music news and my child use it for educational purpose but my son figured out the music very quick only had it for about a week now so i m sure we ll figure out more a we go along
great value just a fast a any tablet ton of free app via amazon underground
cannot beat the price beautiful screen durable material extra bonus for prime user is amazon prime music and video library fit a great niche for ultra portable need for music i pare it with my oonz portable speaker for great sound
love this device the only ncern is that sometimes it doe not hear mmands especially when it play music or tv is on
wa surprised by review i read stating this device had a great display by no mean is the display bad but please this device only st it doe not mpete with the ipad and galaxy tablet the fire o need some sharpening up
no more cable bill i get all i need with it
this is a great inexpensive tablet for beginner it also ha access to amazon prime is library for music and video i would highly remmend it
this tablet wa a christmas gift for my dad it ha great resolution and is easy to use with amazon prime you get free movie book and game i would highly remmend
this kindle ha good quality for the price i bought it for it can basically do anything an ipad doe but it is a lot cheaper if you want to buy your kid a device i remmend this one because it is cheap and if it break then it would not put a big dent in your pocket to buy a new one or you wonfeel bad for spending your money on it
got these a christmas present for some of my family member and i must say they love it
this wa a christmas present for my year old son he love having his own pad pad he see everyone else with a tablet and can now play age appropriate game and watch his show without me having to worry
not the most powerful tablet out there but excellent for the price
the unit work exactly a described a very good buy
from latest news flash to weather info to hearing a joke while oking and waiting for alexa to set a timer the amazon tap is a fun tool to have around the house
bought a few of these for christmas gift everyone is happy it a great device for the low price and great quality a always from fire device
i would remmend this product it work great and ver mpact
great to download book movie music easy to navigate would remmend
work well i used to have kindle and nook on my tablet but find having the kindle separate so much better hold a charge a long time and easier to tuck in my purse and take with me
it work not much else to say
we bought of these for our grandkids a christmas gift these are just the right size tablet for them
even though i m an apple lover i have turned to the firestick and fire tv for internet access on tv is in my house very happy with the ease of set up and the performance
great tablet picture is super sharp and so easy to read
echo is a fantastic product doe everything it say it doe and set up is a breeze
i originally bought the more expensive voyage model and i definalty prefer this one it is much easier to grip and is doe not get a smudgy i uld not tell much difference in the screen quality the major noticeable thing wa the voyage ha a smooth screen and this one is a little rough to the touch but that doe not matter at all
great for price wish the amazon app store had more apps overall good especially for price
you cannot get a better tablet for the price and best buy had it on sale
i purchased chromecasts the year they came out and while they served their purpose for two year they are just not very upgradable i recently bought the fire stick and fire tv box made by amazon i am also a netflix and amazon prime member both of these device are far superior to the option provided by the older chromecasts and even the new k model easy to use and upgradable with many apps and game and if you have amazon prime it is a no brainer purchase
the whole family love it
great battery life excellent screen to read help and direction uld be better but still very happy
i love the size the portability the reading option the organization option the look of the page and the price you cannot go wrong with the kindle paparwhite
i feel like it play the same playlist every time
very simple to set up and use but positioning in your home is a matter of trial and error so that it can hear mmands from all location voice regnition is uncertain at first but the software algorithm learn quite quickly very good for streaming radio a the sound quality is quite good for such a small device highly remmended
this is so easy to use and doe exactly what i hoped
bought it for my yr old granddaughter doe everything she want it to do in a tablet
better than his last kindle camera is great addition
i have been wanting an amazon echo for quit sometime it is everything and more then what i hoped for it is an incredible speaker on top of being the best source for all information the kid even enjoy alexa playing game and singing song it keep my life more organized and more entertaining best money i have ever spent on my love of gadget

this is my nd kindle i had a nd generation the paper white screen clarity is excellent and it is very light
it work well for me however my wife seems to have ld finger and the touch screen doe not always respond one other odd quirk if the tablet is turned off and you plug it in to charge it it automatically turn on you then have to wait until it boot and then turn it off again this is very annoying before remmending to someone i would tell them about this annoying quirk
easy to navigateperfect for little one buy a screen protector too

great little tablet perfect for reading book and listen music
a great tablet for the price really no major mplaints

i thought i wanted but not sure a didnknow who had found out neighbor did saw how much easier it made thing no more note pad cannotell it to remind me about thing etc perfect for my schedule

had the firetv stick and wanted something a little more powerful that also had the capability of playing k ntent much smoother experience overall with the firetv
my first real tablet it work awesome for book and playing movie even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and ha a lot of free apps to play with if your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet i would look else where it is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphone is kind of weak at least for my taste movie look play great which is one of the thing i wanted it for good battery life and overall quality so for the price this is hard to beat
i upgraded from an older kindle that wa not backlit the quality and ease of use is much better and i love the backlit feature
kindle gui interface work like my android fast and friendly thank you best buy keep the hit ming
this e reader make reading ebooks very easy on the eye and provides for a beautiful experience the product feel like quality but gather finger print mark on the back quickly if it doe not have a case overall the e reading experience is excellent though a the lighting and lors me across very pleasantly
i am so pleased with my fire tv very easy to operate
great tablet for a beginner easy to use fast perfect for kid
i bought this tablet for my yo granddaughter and she love it
so easy to read no glare lightweight best e reader ever
the echo is absolutely amazing you can ask alexa almost anything and she ll respond with an answer my only downfall with the echo and the reason i only gave star is because you cannot really ask her to play a song with apple music she work better with an android phone i had to pay for spotify to be able to ask her to play a certain song
bought for my youngest daughter she love it will buy again
so easy to use and so nice to have in kitchen look great in white
it is good but not greatdoes everything form movie to tv and apps and gamesalso there are plenty of mod out there for more feature

we purchased this tablet for my daughter for christmas she is in kindergarten and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class for i uld not beat that especially since i m not going to send a year old to school with an ipad this tablet u fireos which is amazon is customized version of android typically when i look at an android tablet major deviation from vanilla android will make me deduct rating the parental ntrols override any rating deduction in my mind this tablet ha the best parental ntrols i have ever seen in addition the alteration to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter all in all this is a win win the thing that ha really impressed me ha been the speed and responsiveness do not get me wrong this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any mean with that being said i have used android tablet in this price range and they are garbage my wife ha an insignia tablet that st it ha a higher re screen and a few more feature but it nowhere near a responsive when it dy it will probably be replaced by an amazon fire tablet keep in mind amazon is trying to hook you into their esystem there are separate home screen for various type of ntent that amazon delivers your book on one screen or you can swipe to music on another etc from what i see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps the nice thing about the amazon esystem is that it is cross platform they maintain apps for android io roku window ma and so on also their app store is not a extensive a the google play store so i may end up doing some side loading that is not hard and instructional guide are available online for you so in nclusion this is a nice entry level tablet i would bump up to the fire hd for the extra feature if buying for myself however if buying for younger child or if you re really tight on cash you cannot beat it my twin boy are about to turn and these might be on their list for birthday time
decided to go with the fire tv because of wireless issue and uld not be happier
i am not the biggest reader but this made me start reading again really easy to use and very easy to read off at night or in the bright sun very user friendly and lot of little thing to make my reading experience more helpful and exciting originally got the basic edition kindle without the back light and instantly returned it not having to have a well lite room wa more than worth the extra forty dollar
searching the internet is a great bonus with this device
i purchased these tablet for my twin boy knowing they are extremely rough the year warranty wa a definite plus i purchased these in february march i believe and have had replaced not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on of them the only issue i have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited item such a puzzle and a few apps i also noticed that some of them require licensing update which are innvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi other than that i love them and my boy love them
tried fire stick first to slow for me so i exchanged it for this fire tv i like it much better
the amazon fire is a very good tablet that is very user friendly and the price is great
it is a decent tablet for the price especially if you have amazon prime the ad are really annoying though and you have to pay to turn them off or pay extra for a tablet that me without ad
i love my kindle the screen look the same a the voyager to my eye uld not imagine traveling without it
i wa searching for a tablet that would be great for reading book and downloading game this kindle is the right size for a tablet work great
easy and simple for my grandson to use ha no problem using it

picked up the amazon echo on sale and have loved it it is great to have alexa play an artist or band i want here how the weather is or current news it is been a great addition to our house
i love it especially for the price
i bought this for my son to use to watch video play game i have not been dissapointed at all so far money well spent
no mplaints i use it mostly for music if you want it for daily amazon deal you have to turn on click order not sure if i like that feature
i bought this to use only one application oh is it most difficult to get this thing to ntinuously work and i still cannot get the geek squad program to properly download onto the device i m pretty disappointed
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all the only n for those evaluating this a a tablet is that amazon ha their own app store many apps from googleplay appstore are simply not available
reliable and well regulated for dual voltage v and v without too much heat generation in europe asia
my daughter cant put this thing down so it is doing what it is supposed to do
i purchased this to replace a nd generation kindle for my wife she wanted it because of the backlight the item exceeded her expectation great battery life too i took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future
i bought this tablet for myself because i bought the gb one for my year old and wa so impressed with it that i bought myself the gb one
easy to use and kid friendly the price is more than fair on these and offer some decent viewing option if it break no big deal to replace it
this box put roku and any other app box to shame
amazon fire tablet ha been working well it seems to hold battery charge reasonably well it would not be great for the youngest kid due to all the amazon product advertisement but great for him
great starter ereader very simply doe what it is made to do
bought this for our year old son for christmas took it on a mile drive and it wa great for watching movie and playing game only mplaint we have is he wa unable to download madden mobile on it not sure if it is the operating system or something else great size and would highly remmend a a st effective tablet
the amazon echo is not just an amazing sound device but offer an always improved upon array of innovative service my best buy for the year so far
love love love my hubby absolutely love his new kindle fire great picture and easy to use
much better than the stick it allows you to plug directly into your router minimizes buffering by so much get this over the stick
excellent for reading and ha lot of other u with wifi
for the price you cannot beat this tablet it is fast and basic
purchased for a child work great very pleased very versatile
i bought tablet for my grandson is and they are perfect i pre loaded it with game and video for kid their age and before giving it to them for christmas well worth the money
purchased this for my mother in law who love to read but cannot always get to the library it wa easy for her to download book with simple instruction now she is hooked on some game best gift ever
touch is not good also very limited apps on amazon app store
i have never had a tablet i phone smartphone nothing but pc this is my first foray into these modern electronics i must say that while i still find it very nerve wracking this amazon fire tablet ha been pretty user friendly for an old man like me i m learning something new about it every day
i purchased this tablet for my mother in law and she love it

i purchased of these for christmas gift for my son and granddaughter i purchased different lors for the girl so they would not fight and one for my son to replace a broken tablet they all love them
this box is on par or better than the mpetition when mbine with amazon prime star because i feel it is time the internals get an upgrade
i wa not aware of all the apps that needed a premium membership for playing music that wa a disappointment but other than that i enjoy the product
we do not have the best wifi in our house which caused the firestick to ntinually buffer since getting the fire tv we almost never have buffering it is quicker and much more reliable
good quality android tablet also make a very nice gift
the amazon echo is an amazing home automation system work great sound is incredible bluetooth work flawlessly
keep your child entertained with this amazon fire kid edition tablet thousand of child friendly e book tv show game and educational apps accessible through this tablet engage your child in a healthy way while it kid proof case prevents easy damage an expandable memory of up to gb on this amazon fire kid edition tablet provides plenty of storage movie

i bought this e reader for myself and i love it the price wa great and the product is nice
ha a slight smokey look at bottom of page probably because that is where the ad are shown cannot reverse background from white to black reversing to white letter on black background creates le glare for night time reading amazon is the best for customer service a is best buy overall i m very happy with my paperwhite it is very light and now i ll read more very user friendly
it is great i use it every day love the voice mmands
nice sturdy case good way to start child on tablet
i purchased two of these a christmas present for my child i had been researching child friendly tablet with robust ntrols to keep them away from undesirable ntent i found the fire kid edition but after looking over the spec and review i found myself unsure of it i wa mostly interested in the freetime application so i did some research on that and found that it wa available on other fire model also i came across the new fire hd which had more power a better screen and far better battery life at a very affordable price point i gave them a shot and i m glad i did i have the fire hd is locked into freetime mode so the only activity that can be done are one that i approve of but if i want to i can pick up either of them and unlock them to access netflix amazon prime or anything else i desire i currently have reading goal set up that they must achieve before they are able to access video or game and those are limited to x amount of time per day freetime also ha a bedtime feature which disables enables the use of the tablet during designated time which is amazing the hardware itself is exceptional the screen resolution is excellent it is very responsive and the battery life is spectacular they advertise up to hour of battery life and depending on screen brightness ours last almost that long regularly the only n i cannothink of is that the camera are sub par but that is not what i purchased the tablet for so it is a non issue for myself some of the review i read cited that the internal storage wa easily filled with freetime ntent so i installed gb sd card in them i also purchased some rugged child is case for them off of amazon this is probably one of the best purchase i have made in a long time the sound of silent child reading all day is priceless
this tablet wa purchased for my son and wa a great gift very kid friendly offering child safety option great price
my family love how easy it is to ask alexa to play music and some information my year old daughter love to play song on it all day fun product
gotta say i love this silly thing total light show plus so much more
bought this for my year old he love it ha access to the amazon underground store so he can buy all the apps he want i have set ntrols so he cannot accidentally buy something with real dollar a great tablet way beyond expectation for this price
i wa not sure if this product uld do all that it is capable very good quality with excellent sound quality
i have been holding off buying one of these for year but on black friday the price wa an astonishing the amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled it is a great investment if you enjoy book or medium
i bought this for my year old son he love it just ha very limited game on it
better than i expected in performance very reposnsive
my mother love the kendal it wa one that wa rep
i absolutely love my amazon fire it is very user friendly i bought one for my parent and used theirs so much i decided to buy one for myself a well
bought this for my grand daughter a a replacement for her toshiba pad same size and feature seems to work a well or better small st and best buy ha inexpensive add l warranty
amazon tap is a great device the device ha very good audio quality despite it is small size the biggest difference between this and the larger amazon echo is that you have to press the microphone button before the device will listen to you which is great for people who are ncerned that the echo is always listening to what you say so far the battery life ha been great with the alexa app it is very easy to connect this device to different wi fi network
bought this for my year old daughter she love it and i love that it me with a great parental ntrols set up i can let her have some freedom with apps and internet and be fairly nfident that anything inappropriate is blocked i can also set it up so that i can review her activity later on only reason it got star not is the battery life i have a samsung galaxy tablet also and it last several hour longer than the fire tablet with similar use
bought the original when it first came never a problem original battery thought it wa time to upgrade
this is a great new piece of tech if you are savy with it if not it take a while to learn but it follow the step
the kindle paperwhite is the best e reader of them all you can not beat the quality of the screen it is the same resolution and ppi a the more expensive model of kindle the kindle voyage the only issue you may have is the limited storage capacity of gb but that is the standard storage for most e reader
recently purchased this amazon fire box i am still learning how to work everything i am enjoying it so far you do have to have a netflix acunt and alot of the other application to use alot of thing however their is a work around for everything lol i will possibly invest in more of these down the line and maybe get my family to finally cut the rd also
i have had a samsung tablet for year and i have to say that i love this amazon kindle x better the picture quality is amazing it is light weight it is easy to navigate
i have had the amazon fire tv for about a month now and i think it is solid i had the apple tv for about year before this and mpared the amazon fire to the newest apple tv when i made this choice the service i use netflix and hulu plus were available on both but since i am also a amazon prime member and the show are generally cheaper via the amazon store i chose the fire tv the set up wa easy and i like the user interface the system response is snappy mpared to the older apple tv but i am noticing a bit more random reset and freezing with the fire tv i suspect it is software related and can get worked out with update i think it is solid and would remmend the fire tv to anyone asking
i wa reluctant to replace my previous kindle fire because i wa not sure i would like it a well i am pleased to say i m loving it
great screen clarity and rapid turn on all function you need in a transportable tablet
not a great display for watching movie reading book on here is very ol
so much information is put at your fingertip i love the unit and i m going to buy one for my grandson
the echo is a great speaker with clear sound that reach from one room to another the biggest problem that i have had u getting it to work with the nest thermostat the thermostat must be registered under the same email acunt a the echo otherwise the echo cannot remotely ntrol it
i bought this tablet for my year old it is a good tablet for the dollar i paid i just wish i uld remove some of the amazon apps
great sound it need to be a little more sophisticated in responding to input for example yesterday i told it to play mexican music didnknow any same with mariachi music uld not play any odd
purchased this for daughter a a first tablet she love it and it is easy to use plus it wonbreak the bank for a great quality tablet
i enjoy my kindle tv it beat paying for cable every month â ºï
i wanted a tablet quickly on limited fund i not only got one but i got a very good one and with the addition of more storage space it wa justwhat i needed
great product and service the amazon kindle wa is perfect for reading
i wanted to find a tablet to give to my grandkids being able to spend on thanksgiving made this a no brainier for a tablet to give them i wa able to purchase and they are really enjoying it it may not be top of the line but it work great for them
it is a very good tablet for your child everyday use
my original power adapter ha died i purchased this work a designed but even more it is clearly a better engineered replacement unit you can physically see the difference from the connector cable to the transformer body
this kindle ha been great i upgraded from an original kindle and have not looked back i think if you have one of the paperwhite is with the backlight you might not see enough bang for your buck to upgrade though
got this little gem for a family member for christmas she travel a lot and this work perfectly for her on the plane screen quality is pretty good not high def but good my niece love her new tablet
solid piece of equipment very reliable and stream great highly remmended
i love to read but i rarely have time these day for those who do have the time this is a great device because you cannotake it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation the text is crisp and easy to see but i wish the screen wa just a little bigger i ultimately took this back and went with a kindle fire hd the pro of a tablet outweighed the n for my situation but the kindle paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their book anywhere they go
i tried to set it up for over an hour and it would not connect to my wifi the orange ring didnlast more than sec to even give it a chance it just sat their with the ring of death no matter how quick i wa powered my router off and back on even my other device were connected just fine before and after so frustrated and no matter how hard i tried it didnwork so i just took it back and got a refund totally disappointed
one of the best product on the market it amazing how well the echo work the technology that it using is some of the best i have ever used only siri is better i lover everything about well worth the money a i give it five star
this tablet wa everything i wa looking for a cheap tablet that uld download netflix show for offline viewing

alexa is a great addition to the household very user friendly and so many question mmands to be used
system load slow but otherwise is ok be aware that you are not buying a full tablet it wa what i wa looking for
she love to use it to watch netflix and play game
sound quality is amazing i really like the ability to take this on the go downside i wish i didnhave to press the button to talk and to wake the product up

i had the original kindle fire inch and then upgraded to the kindle fire i purchased one of these a a gift for a uple of family member i setup these tablet and i wa surprised that for the price how fast it wa and it ha the same apps and pretty much functionality of my the screen resolution is not a good a a higher priced tablet but for it is great even if you have a tablet already this make for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about i use kindle tablet primarily for medium and entertainment purpose amazon prime movie netflix hulu and the news stand
bought this for a christmas gift the item is great
bought this for my child and ha been exactly what wa needed a cheaper and possibly better option to the ipad
great speed and fast great for kid and teen upgrade easy
great christmas gift for the kid hour of fun and game
i love my smart portable speaker it ha game weather news podcasts radio station etc if something is missing i can connect my bluetooth phone and stream whatever other audio application i want
for the cheaper price i really liked this tablet we bought
i purchased this tablet for my daughter i can set parental ntrols and it ha lasted her for a while
i use this table to ntrol all of the smart device in my home it the perfect size to do so also ha the nvenience of everyone in the home having the ability to do so with out have to u my phone
for a basic tablet this is perfect good price doe all i need it to
not only is this for anyone who ha a hard time affording an expensive tablet it is just a great all around great buy i bought it because prime allows you to download movie onto the device so that you uld watch them on a plane or anywhere you do not have wifi
see above review summary bought for my grandkids and they love watching tv on it learning how to use you should see their face when the tv came on with mickey on it
i wa tired of my cable bill being so high so i got the amazon fire tv digital antenna this is a great alternative to cable tv
read the review bought this tablet to replace an e reader way more than i expected video wa better than review stated book load faster than my old one still getting used to a new o but i am very pleased
easy to set easy to use so glad i upgraded my fire stick to the fire tv box
i wish it ha some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
this is my first e reader i didnknow about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but i do love how small and light it is and that i do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
can be dropped thrown and doesnt break awesome tablet
the echo is a fun time for all i love that i can connect it to light the grandkids love to ask alexa question everyone ha fun with it
cable is too expensive especially when you can buy this and get more than you ever expected you can expand the memory at will you can watch literally anything and although the remote is awful there is an iphone app that allows you to toss that unreliable remote in the trash get this thing thank me later
i m so happy with my purchase i use it mostly a a kindle it is a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue it performs better than i expected for a tablet my wife returned her ipad pro after a week of mparing the two device only star because of the weight and the home screen advertisement both are minor issue
i have been wanting a kindle for some time and am very happy with it
got this a a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this cannot believe how light it is and how well you can read the text if you re up for him and do not want to be caring around an ipad or have battery life on the product while you re on location this is a must take with you product
i got this on black friday for my mom for christmas she love it she never like my present so this is great
bought for husband and he wa surprised it doe the work he need it for
the vacation house we rented for a week this summer had an echo dot we didnknow what it wa until it started talking to u a we must have activated it somehow after our shock we found that it played music told joke and wa in general fun to use so we we arrived home we began exploring what the echo uld do wow it is amazing we have been amazon prime member for many year and this is a logical extension of the amazon esystem i think most folk who use prime will be pleasantly surprised by what it can do however not everyone like it my son in law say it creepy to have something listening to you in your home so most folk will have to get over that for the price it is well worth it to explore the future of technology

i love this thing i remmend it for everyone a must have
these are great little tablet when you get a working one i had to call amazon to return time because they kept sending new faulty one dead pixel on out of fire and also the screen had yellow tint and looked blown up or zoomed in making the text blurry i had to keep of the yellow tinted one because that wa better than dead pixel i just ordered more fire and hoping i do not get the same problem other than that they work super fast and the feel is sturdy and of high quality and make it feel better in your hand than an ipad mini we love this fire i have a transformer ipad mini retina sony reader kindle hd a note a sony z iphone is galaxy is and is and lg g to mpare with overall this tablet is the perfect size and will not disappoint and the new o is much nicer than the older kindles
if you re a amazon frequent flyer like me hd fire is very fun and nvenient placing all aspect of amazon at your finger tip the only thing i dont like about it is that it slow like most tablet
we now have fire tv in every room of the house very user friendly

purchased several of these tablet for my niece and nephew during black friday got them for a great price they are great for the kid only caveat is the storage space gb which is not much when you start downloading game apps but you can buy a microsd card to expand the storage so far it is been useful for watching video browsing internet and playing game i have amazon prime so there are other benefit that you can access on this tablet with prime the only negative i cannothink of are the storage space the camera is not the best quality but not why i bought it and you can only use it with wifi so far loving it and glad i bought it

this device is perfect for viewing on the beach plane etc easy to use
i use this to read thing and purchase item on amazon it doe not play all of my favorite game from the app store nor doe it sync to my android projector so i do not really get full use of the larger screen i think for my u i should have just purchased the e ink version or maybe a full android version
each of my boy have their own kindle fire they love them they re easy to use and the micro sd card slot allows you to upgrade the space to add more movie and game they re especially nice when the wife and i want to enjoy dinner out
enjoyable to have so much music so readily available also great to have song from back in the day so readily available having a weather forecast at voice mmand help thing run more smoothly in the morning very nvenient to have a timer available even though your hand are sticky with dough or meatloaf the ap is also good for finding new skill

got this for our home gym to stream workout guide netflix and music if super fast streaming great quality build and performance love the alexa remote and integration with amazon prime all the apps and ntent u uld ask for have not use the free time parental ntrols but that will be for our third one of these
pro ntrols the light in our house and integrated seamlessly with the wemo app play music well and sound great a a bluetooth speaker we are even able to add grocery via a rd party app ourgroceries n some of the mmands are a bit of a mouthful and if you do not say the mmand in the proper order and in a timely manner alexa will not understand it would be nice if you uld change the default built in list and to do to a rd party app to make the mmands a little easier overall a little expensive for a gadget but the home automation is really fun
great to use for a daily use easy to use and light and great to watch movie
if you travel this is a great accessory to have and use i like the light mpact size and screen resolution work great outdoors a well a indoors will hold many book
i bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price however it only lasted month before the battery died and wa not chargeable regardless of troubleshooting and what rd or outlet i used best buy said they uld not do anything but said amazon uld help me since it should be under warranty i escalated multiple time with amazon and they refused to help me each time so save your and put it towards a good product

love this gadget i highly remmend it easy to set up too
so far i have had my fire tablet for over a month it my first tablet the lack of the googlke play store mean the amazon apps are pretty limited but i found avway around that the front camera is grainy but acceptance while using skype battery doe not last long and it seems to take hour to recharge for a first tablet i suppose those are acceptable flaw feel robust in the hand though the plastic casing reminds you of it material if you hold it tight
this product work great and it wa a present that she seemed to love
i really like it work great i remmended to my friend
traded in the echo for google home after trying both did the training question but still found it uld only answer of question there were many specific apps but trying to remember the cue word is more difficult google home answer without cue word the first time and can extend a nversation based on the first question can ask for driving time to destination without an app same for getting a cktail recipe very dry response where gh ha personality try them both before deciding what is best for your need
i like the paperwhite read it smaller then my tablet can go anywhere with me and i enjoy reading book on it
i bought of these to use in a school education program the worker at best buy assured me the apps i needed them to run would work fine unfortunately i wa not aware that amazon ha it is own app store unrelated to apple and goggleplay make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the amazone app store a not all are specifically they block anything related to goggle other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case
great for listening to music pandora especially or a a novelty
good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner keep him busy
would have been nice to have instruction included
easy to setup very helpful to have we stream music all day thru it also great for creating shopping list just add item when you are thinking about them quick easy make grocery shopping easier and you save money because you have a list
i have looked at getting a kindle for over a year and have looked at the spec and also other tablet i enjoy reading and when traveling have to pack book when i cruise i decided to get the kindle fire great price and get it a try i love it and will someday upgrade to a larger model have read book all ready and have more waiting to be read great one to start using an ereader
upon purchasing this i uld not imagine what i wa missing it ha been a great upgrade to my home it ha really brought my home closer to the new age
so far this is the best least expensive medium player i have found that meet my need every medium player can stream amazon netlfix hulu what set this apart is since it u android you can actually do stuff with it if you do not mind side loading some stuff in my case i use it to run kodi why well kodi can play dvd iso file i have bought hundred of exercise video over the year and need the iso in order to use the menu with kodi you can do this the last medium player at this price point that uld do this wa the wd tv live this is that plus plus plus highly remmend

great product but only a good a what you have to sync to it
my mom love it she u it everyday for everyday u and to video char
i realize that many people will believe that this product is a cynical attempt to pump up amazon is profit and i m sure it ntributes but do not deny yourself the serious fun this device will bring into your home we originally bought this a a gift for my seeing impaired mother in law in order for her to enjoy trivia music and audio book with a hand free interface we didnanticipate enjoying it ourselves so much that i m not sure we re going to be willing to let it go setup is dead simple if you already have an amazon prime acunt and wireless internet access the audio quality and the unit is ability to cut through ambient noise in order to hear you are remarkable the device is solidly built and ha several nice ergonomic touch such a the rotating lor changing ring of light that let you know you are being heard to the rotating volume ring at the top of the unit it is amazing what the echo can do i ll leave the voyage of disvery up to each of you do get used to hearing hmmm i m not sure about that or i m still learning about but i am certain that the echo is cloud based brain will only get better with time do yourself a favor and get one of these the whole family will enjoy it
good for kid good for reading not good for much else

echo wa easy to set up speaker is not a good a the google home both the nest thermostat and the inseon hub seem to be working okay with the echo star because i have not used all the function yet

got it a a present and love the size of the screen
the product is very light making it easy to read
great tablet for my four year old son he had been through three other cheap tablet this is far better built for a toddler especial for the price
i would remmend this ereader above all others for it high quality and diversity not only a an ereader but a a web browser
pleasant to read at night while everyone sleep great for use outside and inside like reading a book without losing my page
good amazon product good camera and amazing apps
ha a great processor for it size it is robust with lot of feature and ha a wonderful small remote that fit nicely in your hand the remote ha much fewer button then your standard remote which make it very simply to use and along with amazon gui interface make it simple to get around i had other product that it mpetes with and this is by far the best easier device to get around with
fantastic e reader battery last a few week on a single charge if you leave wifi turned off feel great in your hand is very lightweight
enjoy quick fact check like who wa in this movie or how tall is lebron james but would not spend the money it sts myself it wa a gift maybe i have not learned enough of the function yet

i had the firestick first so i decided to upgrade my new tv with a firetv and i have not had any issue it is so easy to use run way smoother than my firestick and i love that i can upload storage with my micro sd card
i purchased this product during a recent sale i am loving it from streaming music to my phone setting alarm checking my schedule and playing music i also purchased some smart switch and am able to ntrol several device using my voice lately i have noticed that i am having to repeat the wake up phrase sometimes however this is not a big deal
alexa make everything easy this wa the best purchase ever
i bought this for my year old son this is a great beginner tablet for the price
i used to read on my ipad this is so much better on my eye and lighter to hold
it wa really easy to set up a much more inexpensive alternative to cable television
i got this after returning google home because i had multiple bedroom and i wanted a platform to connect them together you would had to buy multiple google home which is expensive solution however with echo you can mbine it with alexa dot which is a lot cheaper in the room that you do not need large speaker and keep echo in the living room or so i found that i can integrate a lot application and device through alexa app which wa not available in google home i would definitely remmend you getting this product verse google home
the fire tv ha a great interface and is very fast

i bought this for my wife for mother is day she love reading but with the little one in the house book were hard to keep we are both very pleased with this a i can use it for a few book too the picture and lor on this thing is pretty darn good i m pleased with the sound a well overall this price is too good to pa up if you want a lor screen reading tablet this is a solid choice
there is nothing else i can say about this product except that it is an excellent gadget to have around the house you want to hear music have a question about the weather trivia sport etc just ask alexa
this fire tablet ha handled all of the facebook game i play without skipping or tieing up i m very impressed
great price great product for a beginner tablet it is useful and fast enough to keep your music and game going
great product for anyone who love to read i highly remmend it
this looked easy but hard to setup if no experience with other than apple product
awesome screen and battery life also lightweight and handy
i love my new echo ha a super loud clear sound also is so useful just being able to ask and getting answer when your hand are dirty or caught up doing something else
if you are a digital reader you need a kindle this is excellent but expensive if you are a casual reader you will probably be happy with a le expensive kindle i do remmend a case
would remmend for the right person that want low st tablet but ended up returning this item because it wa heavy and too wide for my hand to hold it wa too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet ended up just using my lenovo yoga since it wa more flexible and only about lb heavier
i wa pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed the kindle fire this wa my first ever use of buying book on kindle due to summer ur i wa taking at the time in may june what i liked kindle book synched on macbook and fire tablet very helpful when it came time to write my paper the highlight i made while i read the book on the tablet synched to the version i read on the macbook desktop this helped a ton especially with thing like formatting the footnote watching video ol little feature while you watch a video you cannotap the screen and it will list the actor who are currently one the screen amazon shopping i can now understand people is amazon shopping addiction l i will give it to amazon this tablet became my gateway to using prime and untless hour of online browsing prior to this i rarely purchase item online i can see how they have made it so easy across platform portability i like that i will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading need rather than having to use my laptop or my phone what i did not like sign on screen ad there is no way to turn them off i suppose for depending if you purchased on a sale the advertiser are subsidizing the st of the tablet however i wished this wa stated a a feature before purchasing it i may have paid the money and upgraded to the next kindle if i had known it uld not be turned off turning off standby mode this took some time to get used to rather than an issue when you turn the tablet off it is really on a standby mode so the battery will drain you have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned off weather app i do not know if this is just my tablet the weather app doe not update a soon a you open it it take minute if at all to update with the current weather i have not been able to find in any forum if other people are experiencing the same issue i have instead downloaded and used other weather apps but at this point the app is worthless screen resolution it is not the best but i got used to it for reading and occasional video viewing purpose it is sufficient screen dimmer blue light mode i read and use the tablet at night and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen and the system is default dimmer and blue light feature is awful the blue light app allows you to set the lor tone however it is so orange it make it unreadable the app i use instead is called bluelight blocking and even dimming the brightness with the slider wa still too bright for me so i have had to download the app dimly so be able to set the brightness
this fire is a bit smaller than my kindle fire from a few year back i still seems to have all the feature and is the price
i really enjoy my echo i also bought a battery for it so i cannotake it place
it is inexpensive so you can get many of them it also ha a speaker
this is a great device i needed something small to read book on this device is exactly what i wa looking for
i needed to upgrade my electronics since i have not bought a tablet in a uple of year what i had at home would not stream what i wanted to see i went in looking for a in and came out with this in after the sale assoc showed me it feature answered my question much more portable than a in would have been too
solid amazon tablet for those invested in the amazon esystem
it work really well with a lot of really ol feature it is still missing a few thing that the google home ha map but it is still better than the google home
i like the product it work great it is just what we were looking for however we had to sign up for the amazon prime membership just to set up the acunt to actually use the product we were not prepared for that
fire tv is a game changer definitely worth it to spend the extra clam on this over the fire stick awesome product
bought it for my year old son it good to get him this for a great price and get him off my ipad lol
simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adult and child
needed to replace my original kindle with a keyboard wa leary about new model a very pleased with original this is improvement a same size screen but smaller in overall size and easier to scroll through page
love the abundance of medium outletsavailable love it
scratch easily but otherwise good case can also be hard to find
i wa looking for a good tablet to use for movie music and to browse internet and when i saw that this tablet wa on sale i had to buy it and i m glad i did this is a great tablet and it is light i carry in my purse i love it
this l il baby doe everything my wife want from her laptop without forcing her to sit at a table to do it for the money this cannot be beaten
i bought it a an addition to my cable service and it is meeting my need and expectation for the product
the amazon fire hd is really nice doe everything i need it to
easy to use and work great able to watch all the thing i love

we bought this for my wife who love to read she always ha it with her and doe not put it down great product
i have the firestick but once purchasing this firetv the firestick is now in a spare room and the firetv is my main device downstairs it is very quick with minimal lagging if you have a decent ip you will be very satisfied with this product
amazon fire is great for reading my kindle book checking email facebook or checking out the internet have not ck d out what else i can do with it but i m sure there is a lot
great product and lightweight battery keep it charge would remmend this product to another young person
the device is so simple for kid it is great i love the case it is really protective
great deal for the st would purchase item again
wa looking for a new tablet great price for this one
i purchased the fire tablet with expectation of a average performing tablet at best i wa surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so i would remmend this tablet to anyone that want a good performing tablet without a hd screen
but i cannot figure out how to move book i have read into the cloud i do not like clutter and the more i read and download just clog up
i bought this one for my wife for mother is day and she just love it i have had the same for a uple of year and always enjoyed it and she wa borrowing it all the time to read out in the backyard now i solved the problem by buying her one of her own we re both happy
great but i would not use it for a sole purpose a being my primary tablet
i love it all you have to do is to talk to it i have another system i do not use just for no look for the remote the bad thing with the echo is that sometimes can understand what we are asking but even that is fun
bought for my daughter she like it just for reading book
i got this for my class i love the setting for it i have a child acunt so my student can only use the apps that i put awesome tablet
this is a good product for video surfing and reading however this version ha dropped all android support a far a i cannotell i have a uple of apps that run on my old fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one there is one app i use everyday but it doe not work on this new fire so i have to keep the old one around kind of innvenient i would remmend seeing if your app is supported on this fire before dropping the money
perfect tablet for kid easy to use and a great size
fire is slow when surfing web i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store
work good still ha buffering issue otherwise no problem
overall very good product for kid much robust and easy to operate only downside is that it is sometimes very slow
bought kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch video bought gb microsd card loaded video and install apps there a the device only ha gb ram internal this kindle ha a known issue with not regnizing the microsd card sometimes which requires pulling the tablet out of the drop proof case a pain removing and reinserting the sd card until the tablet regnizes it time nsuming and frustrating amazon doe not seem too ncerned with fixing this issue it is minor really video playback is fine but web surfing on the child is profile for educational site is slow sluggish not a fan of amazon is ad all over the place and their app store is limited for the price hard to ask a lot it ll serve it is purpose
hand down a great update to my first gen kindle worthwhile
very nice display and high resolution a pleasure to read
great price and value fast processing many game and user option available
like that i can send and receive e mail and do general office work and use for pleasure and research
i have had lot of tablet in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this wa written alexa had not been added to the tablet first while this device run an android type of operating system amazon put it own spin on the operating system i do not feel like i m using android this feel different to me it doe not have the same level of customization that android user have me to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device ha been tailored to be your ntent entertainment machine it is simply a fun way to nsume your magazine book etc there are on screen button on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately take you to your home screen the button to the left act a a sort of back button it also let me get rid of my keyboard when i do not need it on screen but it is open the button to the right is super important it took me a uple of day to realize what it doe that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it let you switch between apps but it also let you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the rner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them you ll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps the device ha several menu that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet me with several apps pre installed such a slik amazon is own internet browser audible good read the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such a twitter facebook etc you can mbine the apps on this page into folder you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device setting this feature doe not necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only change the font on your main screen if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issue it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new item the device me with a free month subscription to the washington post you ll see that under new item when you initially activate your tablet you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photo you can do this through the setting menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photo however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon is photo app which is a cloud based app so far i have not found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper i m not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photo from my phone into amazon is cloud just so i uld view them on my tablet that being said i m not planning to take photo on this device i just wanted a few pet photo on there and the ability to change my wallpaper beyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are pre arranged to be book video game shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screen are connected to your amazon acunt for example if you have kindle book you have already purchased they automatically will appear under the book menu your magazine and newspaper subscription will appear under the newstand menu there doe not seem to be a way to change the order of the menu page that bug me but it is not the end of the world there is also one menu to the left of the home menu it is the recent page it show you what you have received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some people one of my favorite feature of this tablet is amazon is on deck capability if you re an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it think you might like the item do not unt against your pre installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory start getting full you cannoturn off the on deck feature if you do not like it i have been ntent with the video playback capability this is not my major use of the device but the image look fine and the audio is ok i ll talk more about the speaker later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine ntent through the newstand i have tried magazine on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazine with me so if i m stuck at the airport or at the doctor is office i always have them one of my regular magazine includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my acunt to the device this allows me to download the back issue of the magazine for a long a i have had an acunt my other magazine didninclude a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it wa an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazine that you cannotry free for day on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazine on this gadget is a pleasure the kindle fire doe not me with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instruction to do this it is not difficult to do if you re fairly mfortable with technology it probably took me minute most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i uld have them wa to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon pre installed on this device there are no line between the letter on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through key but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it wa a pretty easy problem to solve so i cannot mplain apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device mpared to my other gadget but that generally doe not bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device is not bad if i mpare it to my fancy phone it is not a shape but when you think about the price of this device mpared to my smartphone the screen is outstanding the speaker are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wonsay that they are fantastic they are not in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre install app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphone etc this device wa not made for taking picture it ha a front and back camera but they are not designed to be spectacular i m not using them i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hand i think that is partly because of the size and partly because it feel very slick also i do have some hand problem similar to someone who ha carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives i m still waiting for it i m greatly enjoying this device it is simply fun to use the tablet there are weakness that me with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon service if you do not typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you re looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you
for the price the tablet work well the biggest issue i have had is the battery life length the battery seems to not last a long a my previous ipad mini
very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving a a gift to a family member or friend
alexa do something welme to the new internnected world circlers do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice mmand this may be for you do you feel that technology is driving our life more and more toward the dystopia of david egger the circle and you want to escape from technology for a while then likely not a even though you have to touch the button on this unit a opposed to the always on echo and echo dot your life is still connected to alexa via voice prompt i liked using it for amazon music and the occasional amazon video but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an uber some people may feel they need technology to run their life i am not quite there yet and may never be it is fun for what it doe though and it is a good bluetooth speaker
the lady that helped me wa very professional and knowledgeable she understood what i wa looking for let me know that she would have to order it she did just that and it showed up day earlier than originally told

the amazon echo is used by me every day for various task it can get me my daily news briefing tell me the weather outside and play music form my amazon library and other source very useful and fun item
it is too heavy for it size i purchased it to replace a larger nook and find that it weighs a much screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public place hanging on to wifi is difficult it is not efficient when downloading buffering buffering and i am still debating returning it for another tablet
easy to setup and use the ntent is very clear connect to wireless or ethernet and off to the race
set up for kid right out of the box cannot beat amazon is warranty either thanks for providing an outstanding product
but to build on and if you use it it is nvenient to have and can be taught many skill

bought this tablet for my kid and they love it the fire allows them access and freedom to a tablet without the high st
we love our amazon fire tv we get all our favorite show and movie it work perfectly
i think this tablet is better for simple usage not so much for a whole lot of apps and game a the memory is used up super fast for only being gb when in reality you do not get the full gb to begin with i got this for my yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there is not enough memory for it to fully function you pretty much have to get a memory card for it with atleast gb or more but for a starter and for basic stuff checking social medium etc it is fine and for a starter tablet for kid
son in law asked for this a a christmas gift wanted something to take along on business trip for easy access to book and or game he is very pleased with it

you get what you p ay for and more for this tablet i would only go with a kindle or an ipad and who want to pay time a much when kid are hard on thing
for me it is too small i would prefer it to be
i am very pleased that i wa able to purchase this a a gift for my daughter
i have more fun with this thingâ i m much more likely to play music or check the temperature or news because alexia is nstantly attached to my network and is always charged and ready to go there is no pairing required so i simply call out her name and she responds there is always a battle between me and my teenager trying to outshout alexa instruction so we can hear the music that we like best
i love the fact that i can expand the memory the image is much better and faster than the stick
my five year old son love his amazon fire tablet it wa well worth the purchase price
if you do not want to pay the extra for the smart tv add a amazon fire tv to your tv and you will have a smart tv great for the price
easy to use for kid and elder very basic function
good mpared to other system like roku but really need to get an easy way to close apps running in background
this is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite not sure is worth the premium though while faster than paperwhite it is still way le responsive than an ipad it is very hard to type on it when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance i like the navigation area on the edge of the screen but i m not crazy about them i m not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that mfortable while reading in bed i guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely i previously had a paperwhite which got lost and i thought i d better buy the latest kindle now when i bought the paperwhite it ha been an experiment a i m not an avid reader and i have a hard time reading paper book since i got surrounded by gadget i actually read few book on the paperwhite and i enjoyed it so when i lost it misplaced it i wa longing for it a i had few book i wanted to read if this would be priced at least cheaper i think it would be a star proposition like it is now it is a tad too expensive for the spe and the shortmings closer to it would be a sweet price prefered buying at bestbuy over amazon a the loyalty program are better v nonexistent and i also used a mover upon
my paperwhite died so i went with the voyage and i m loving it it is basically the same a the paperwhite with the addition of sensor on the side to turn the page if you do not want to swipe the screen and of urse faster processor etc
i chose the alexa with the better speaker and sound since it will be used to listen to mucic can browse a multitude of station and various style of music
i had been using a kindle fire hd for a uple of year but over time found i wa mainly using it for reading i had been nsidering switching to a pure ereader for a while but wa not nvinced until i saw some spec on the voyage i ordered it right away and have been very happy with it

lightweight nice display and not too large to carry
good for reading book light handy but not so much for browsing
this is a nice low price entry point into the tablet market some folk use them allot while others do not this is a non expensive way to find out

only small issue wa setting up to start with my kid took care of that
we got it for travel purpose we didnexpect much
excellent tablet for everyday use it is not a responsive a the ipad mini but cannot beat the price
i wish alexa were more like rosie the robot on the jetsons but she is a ton of fun and moderately useful she may have thousand of skill but in a fairly narrow range how many joke or inspiration skill doe anyone ai really need so a broader base with more game better understanding of smart device etc would be spectacular
highly better alternative then the fire stick faster ui and perferomance mpared to the fire stick
this thing is ok next time we get electronics it will be amason
it is a great speaker for the kid and the whole family i love it especially the game it play on family night
swiping had to be repeated several time sometimes to get the action to respond returned
i read a lot so i wanted a light weight device it is user friendly you can adjust the brightness of light and turn page easily it fit nicely in my bag i take it everywhere i highly remmend it

i bought this a an alternative to my previous rechargeable bluetooth speaker seemed like every time i went to use it the battery wa dead echo is always plugged in and ready to go and the interface is an added bonus for a month i subscribed to amazon unlimited and just request alexa to play song to my heart desire i use it a a clock to wake me up in the morning and ntrol my light highly remmended
this is a great device for someone who like to check email quickly and good size to hold while reading and to carry with you if you like to read while on the go
i love my amazon echo dont know how i wa able to live without it cabt recmend enough
this feel like an affordable tablet while not the best in class it is not priced to be that either work well happy with purchase
the amazing amazon echo that is the perfect heading for the speaker actually it is far more than the speaker this may be one of the best purchase i have ever made i use it to order an uber to order pizza to look up recipe and to buy thing on amazon simply a genius product
i thoroughly enjoy reading on this that is the main reason i bought it and it fit nicely in my purse
we use our echo every day do not know what we would do without her
got it on sale for for techo illiterate dad and he like it so far better screen quality than i expected
it work great not affected by the singular wifi band at all battery life is amazing just be sure you can get the apps you d like from the appstore google play is not accessible so if you re looking for snapchat instagram nbc mcast vudu you wonget those here returning it which is too bad i really enjoyed it more bang for the buck if you uld access those apps but like i said it wa my fault for not checking first i wa expecting the apps from unknown source to kick in but it so didn
use it a lot for listening to audio book too many ad
i had been looking at the echo for awhile but wa not an early adopter a much a i geek out over product like this i wanted to wait till the skill library wa a bit more tested and expanded well imagine my surprise when i got this a a gift absolutely love using my echo alexa weather music shopping list and the nstant thing they are adding yes it ha it moment when it cannot understand something but i do tend to mumble at time do not expect it to be a search engine giving multile result to an inquiry but it is a great speaker home assistant kitchen helper with measurement and it even ntrols my home temperature on my honeywell thermostat next purchase smart plug so i cannoturn some item off and on with my voice love the interactivity and i have not even scratched the surface yet on all alexa ha to offer i have found the love my echo website to disver new thing i have not tried yet
this wa a gift for my wife who love to read she ha the kindle fire and enjoys it her wish were to have a smaller lighter reader that is also good to ready outside she found it with the voyage
it ha a lot of free game plus all of the book i read it is awesome i do not even use my phone a much h because i have my tablet for the price it cannot be beat
we love our echo it ha been a fun toy for all in the family she update u on weather play music tell u the news and even tell u joke
my only gripe is the lack of certain apps on the kindle store but it is only a handful lightweight good resolution good for those not willing to drop is on ipads
we love our amazon echo very easy to setup and use it is fun to ask alexa anything she never disappoints
i just have to say this product is fun and very functional i get up in the morning and i get news briefing from her then i can play game and music all through the day i am able to leave message for other family member who have the same product and they can answer me back i m loving it
it great for child not stly good for daily use
i bought this for my son he absolutely love it his purchase wa mainly based on his friend having this model and being very pleased with it he is very pleased with it
i had originally bought my son the kindle fire hdx and it worked great for him the only downfall to it wa he wanted both the rear and front facing camera but it only came with the front facing camera a child do they break thing and he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year i did not want to spend that much money on the send kindle so that is why i chose this amazon fire inch tablet and it ha the front and rear facing camera and that my son wanted all the feature are the same it is a great buy i would highly remmend it
the recipient of this gift wa very happy to receive it worked great
purchased this for my mother for mother is day it wa very easy to set up and very easy for her to use great buy and value

great for checking my email and watching netflix
durable work great enjoy using it for book and audio book
performance and interface are great and you can add most of android apps too
i got this to replace the ipad for a child i am so disappointed by the charge it dy so quickly and the charger ha to be wrapped around the tablet in order for it to charge this wa after week of having the tablet low price but not worth the hassle and disappointment
best streaming tool i have seen and used
from the minute you turn it on there is advertising the o is very different from a standard tablet o i uld not get an app that i wanted from the google play store it just would not work on this a i said before i found the amount of advertising just ridiculous
wa used a a gift receiver said wa delighted and would begin using immediately
great tablet for kid big choice of apps great price
i am not highly technical and this wa easy to learn how to use it is small enough to be easy to carry i have been able to download the few game that i play so far i cannot find a single thing to be unhappy about
it is a good tablet for the price nsidering it wa only not the best quality but suitable for my kid to enjoy
mpact and very good for the price good picture and sound quality
the text is sharp and paper like in well lit nditions when using the backlight in dark nditions it bemes le paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on light can set on automatic brightness level or manually set slim and lightweight when not using a case which i appreciate most about this kindle make for easy holding and carrying packing practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device i also like that it ha page press which is outer press button for page turning one n is it not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store though it is the fastest kindle yet i would not say it is to dollar well spent over the paperweight in fact i would remmend the paper weight when it me down to price im just someone who want the best of the best so i bought of these one for my love a a gift then i went and bought myself one it wa a well recieved gift and i aquired major browny point we give them thumb up we can read together in bed in the wood on the road or wherever we like this is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go i would give it if that wa an option
very easy to use the kindle app work well regular tablet search simple game email all work fine sometimes a little slow i used this a my travel tablet and teader the advertising is a pain but help keep the price down
great learning tool for my granddaughter she love it
love the back lit screen for reading in all sort of lighting situation
amazon ha hit it out of the park with this one simply amazing
i purchase this for my wife it work well but i think that this version e too expensive the difference is a light
i love the kindal because i am a reader i able to check out book from library through overdrive but if i get an alert about world event i simply go to ond of the news app is and get the latest headline great price
the kindle wa a gift and they are very happy with it purchasing it wa a simple process
i had a st gen fire and enjoyed it but this one is a lot more fun love the dual camera the more user friendly interface and the ability to add apps from google play so my apps are in sync with the apps on my phone would definitely remmend to anyone looking for a versatile tablet
very user friendly and straight forward instruction great for all age
this tablet is your best deal for the money since it u an adaptation of andriod made by amazon it is technically possible to install google play app store without routing the device if you read a bit online making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight absolutely remmended
i recently replaced a xiaomi mi box with this fire tv box and it been nothing short of excellent ntent availability and flawless performance it just work great should have bought this in the first place instead of cheaping out with the mi box
i have this paired with my samsung smart thing wemo device smart light bulb lifx and sengled she is pretty witty and very fun to mess around with and understands you even with music or tv on at loud volume i love the feature and cannot wait for more mpatible device to me out
we are more than satisfied with this tablet along with the price
star in everything close your eye and just buy it
the sound from this unit is just incredible and with almost million song for to a month depending on the amazon plan it just doe not get any better add in the fact it ntrols all the light in my home my samsung robot vacuum and can answer almost any question i ask her it is hard to imagine life without my alexa
i have purchased other kid tablet but this is the best it is user friendly and interactive my grandson carry it with him where ever he go
for the price it is a decent tablet they way they get the price down is to psuh ad to your device you can pay to get the ad removed overall it is a good tablet
i love this tablet so much that i bought of then for my family so they can have there
i absolutely love the echo it work great with home automation device i love how i can use it with pandora
i m an amazon prime netflix stumer and i just love this thing i no longer have mcast tv only antenna and two fire tv is absolutely love it it is fast a long a my internet is good
i bought the amazon fire a a gift and it work great if you want a tablet that is not expensive and will work for game this would be a great choice
it should be easier to print off highlight and have a choice not to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight it should be easier to erase all highlight regular book number should rrelate with location easier to forward through chapter
improved over the hd thing set up differently but not hard to learn also a bit heavier than the so reading in bed a little harder
if you want fast menu and stable streaming avoid the wifi only firestick and get this firetv if you want reliable streaming that will not frustrate you do the work of running an ethernet cable this box with ethernet is head and shoulder better than a firestick firestick stream well most of the time but sometimes it struggle and you get error with either directv now or p vue forcing a device restart very frustrating this box plugged in with an ethernet cable stream perfectly on the same network with the same ntent of the time i eliminated nflicting frequency used ghz frequency have a great router fast internet i tried everything the cure wa this device hooked up by ethernet cable the fact that you can put kodi on this box open the whole world of movie up to you you can also load android apps from your phone to the device with appsfire i put blue iris on my firetv if have two of these in my home now one in the master bedroom and one on my k tv there is not a ton of k ntent yet but you can go to youtube and see some amazing video in k there when i buy a new home at the end of the year i plan to run ethernet cable and have one of these at every television i cut the cable mpany off year ago and have never missed them other than internet i pay a month for p vue and along with kodi i have everything i uld possibly want and more goodbye cable tv
the paperwhite model ha a very clear screen and backlight so i can be used in most lighting nditions the manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of my only mplaint is that it includes a usb cable but doe not include a charger in the box luckily i had a number of appropriate charger that work well with the reader mpared to the more expensive model the paperwhite had the functionality that i wa looking for at a reasonable price
love my kindle at the price it is the best value in tech right now
this is my send tablet that i have purchased this one wa a gift for other son he love it i remmended it to numerous friend

my girl loved it she love that it linked to echo
i purchased this table to use to check my email and get on facebook but i use it for so much more it is a great tablet for a good price
the amazon echo tap is a nice interesting device but it did not fit my need i also have the amazon echo and absolutely love it so what is the difference a you have to walk up the the tap to touch it this is not a nvenient and not a fun a the talking to the echo from across the room b the audio quality not very good more like a small bluetooth speaker c the tap is fine around the house when it is connected to the home wi fi but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi fi that is not going to work very well
the echo is plenty loud for our need and performs a expected
very excited to try this and so far so good
no access to the internet wonremmend
amazon ha created a great smooth intuitive and responsive interface it work and work well
i have all tipe of tablet my favorite is the apple but i prefer fire tablet better than samsung any time

i love my kindle voyage it is very little weight and i love the page press that it ha do not even have to move your hand to turn the page you can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablet you can do that with
within the low price range this tablet is excellent for watching tv movie or reading a book pro very sharp display fast screen response fair speaker low price n need adding memory in form of micro sd card and beming an amazon prime member to make this tablet worthwhile

price wa right great tablet for playing game and reading
ok for a younger teen mediocre product still worth the sale price
it wa on a total of an hour and a half when the screen went mpletely dark would not turn on after that the battery wa fine it just quit working all together

work well though i ended up getting the hd because of the bigger screen a storage
love it best purchase especially if you have someone to program it for you
love the kindles this wa a gift and a great value i have one myself
this tablet is not a high tech state of the art speed demon but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use the two biggest benefit to me are that it now me with alexa built in and you can download amazon movie to the device to watch offline for example on an airplane these two feature alone make it worth the very reasonable price
to date i have experienced issue i m a rd cutter and amazon fire tv ha helped make that possible
echo performs well when she understands the question asked i find myself often repeating question because alexa doe not get it right
i have both fire tv and the fire stick the fire tv is way faster than the stick
this e reader is perfect it is user friendly hold a charge for uple day which is oerfect the size is very mpact i carry with me everywhere
i bought kindle fire for my grandson who is i have one and he thought great can do so much on it for the price you cannot beat it i use more then mputer
work great we love it i would remmend fire tv to anyone
i m an avid android user however you d be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range the quality of this amazon fire tablet is really great it is not hd but that doe not matter to my year old who u it to play game and listen to music it ha extremely robust parental ntrols allowing parent to set a child profile and then set screen time limit bedtime and limit ntent available the child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion a i think my year old uld handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon ntent and kiddie game only overall i am very happy with this purchase
thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that last enjoy the ease of navigating the apps good picture and sound
the medium player is mpact and low profile the remote is nice the unit remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it this may be due to the fact i am running kodi i do have a first generation firestick with kodi that doe not freeze up like this unit the performance difference between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion
i have had my fire for year at least and love it bought this for my mother her ipad died she is enjoying it her only issue is there is a game she cannot download because it is on google play
i found this ver to be quite handsome in appearance everyone who see it mments on how ol or how nice it is very simple and very functional it is very easy to attach the kindle dx to it and the fit is perfect most importantly it appears amazon ha solved the older problem with this ver somehow damaging the kindle if one opened the ver from the back too far now there is a small magnet embedded in the back of the ver that gently keep the back ver snug to the kindle dx and serf to gently remind you with a gentle tug if you accidentally attempt to open your kindle backwards for me it is an elegant and well thought out solution
very durable ver take the abuse that a year old give it
i bought one last year for my year old granddaughter and believe me she love it she deal with it perfectly we put a gb card and downloaded music video and movie and she find everything a few day ago i bought another for my twin grankids they are only month old but we are going to start putting their music and movie with the bluetooth they will enjoy it i got a free in store set up so their mom will learn how to use it

the kindle paperwhite is a great e reader i did ton of research before getting one for me i wa trying to choose between the regular kindle and this one the major difference there is the back lighting holy w i simply cannot get across how much i have used the backlighting i mean i cannot even imagine at this point not getting this one over the regular kindle i have even taken to reading before bedtime in the dark and then putting the kindle down when i m sleepy seriously if you re trying to figure out which one to get the paperwhite is definitely the way to go especially because of the adjustable back lighting man alive what a great purchase

i bought of these played with one of them then gave then a gift to people for christmas
screen is good lack of google play kinda hurt but you will survive the issue of back button or multifunction button is that sometime they do not appear when you need them a they are part of the screen so you have to kinda summons them which is a pain

we have tried several of these little streamer box fire tv roku apple tv not the newest one i think the roku is my favorite this one is mpetent if you have amazon prime you ll miss it on the apple tv but the voice mmand mode the one distinguishing feature of the fire is not useful it only search amazon ntent and while amazon ha a lot of stuff we watch more on netflix hbo showtime hulu etc so not so useful i would get the roku the remote with headphone is a great feature
good speaker i have learned to really like alexa she is more than a speaker lot of option carry it around for use on our outside deck
the clarity of any audio ming out of the amazon echo is truly incredible i bought one because a friend of mine let me barrow his before i got lasik surgery i needed story to keep myself busy and from going crazy she ha different skill she can learn and provide that is if you remember the mmand for said skill great for news quick weather update on your area etc fantastic product

perfect size and feature for my year old daughter fire is made well she love it to read and to play game on
the fire hd tablet is a good product the screen ha good viewing angle and the display is on point however the major issue i have are you have to be online to make any setting change to the tablet and the advertisement that show up on the home screen is a downer so the rating of a star is pushing for me

i use this e reader primarily for library book the amazon interface for checking out library book is cumbersome however the final result is great the device work great in both sunny and dark room syncs well with my kindle app on my ipad battery life is very good

my product rating is based on my experience with my own fire i received last fall a a gift i purchased this fire a a christmas gift and the recipient seems to be happy with it i would like to be able to manage the material on the cloud easier but this may have been addressed with the newer model
work well in sunlight i love it no pesky ad love it
still adjusting had kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning page definition and location in book paper weight is much more difficult to maneuver doe not seem to be a touch sensitive a the fire i have to repeatedly touch screen to get page to turn and definition accessibility also take more work also bookmarking doe not seem to stay on page

the inch amazon fire th edition is by the far the best tablet in the amazon market the inch is a nice size but the inch ha better screen resolution and longer battery life if you are an amazon prime member this is a must have tablet also the amazon magnetic case doe a great job in protection and sleek ness

i love how sturdy it is it doe not seem like it would be but it is great i especially love how when you open it the screen automatically turn on i wa hesitant at first about the lor citron but it look so much better in person it doe take a flat surface to hold it up meaning it is hard to use on a uch or bed but it still work really really well

i wa looking to purchase a tablet for my kid so they uld work on homework this is just what they need in term of capability and size it is a great tablet for the price
the fire tv outperforms the apple tv i have already installed on my tv great k playback and great selection of apps
i have my alexa in the kitchen on unter and it is fun to ask question about weather sing song and about recipe i bought of these for me and for my neighbor we both love it it is fun to speak out loud and interact with alexa thanks for making a great product amazon
we bought wowwee mip robot for our grandson and year old they do not have ipad or iphone in their home so thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app talked with best buy salesperson who said the app uld be loaded via the app store it cannot kindle fire is included on the wowwee mpatibility list so we bought them each a brand new kindle in order to use the app they had kindles from earlier year but these would not support the bluetooth functionality needed for the robot absolute fail we tried every possible nfiguration adult v child amazon acunts bluetooth on first or off first mip on first or off first etc it never worked at all not even once also tried full factory reset on each device loading the app via a google play acunt rather than amazon kindle acunt google play would not load the app said it wa not mpatible with this kindle device opened a ticket on wowwee the response wa that they have had the same experience the bluetooth on this kindle fails and so the app doe not work with the wowwee robot they admit it fails yet it is still on their approved list so this wa an absolute waste of money tho at least the boy can play some free game we loaded for them
this is a great product i purchased for travel so i would not have to carry my laptop performs well very quick
alexa is nice but it lack a lot of informayion when asking question it is not like your smart phone that you can ask anything and will give you the answer only to certain thing and you have to email el certain apps in the alexa app itself to work still working on alexa so maybe that uld be the reason but i though it would be like siri that you can ask anything
once you get a stable and reliable internet you re good to go
love it use it for watching tv and listening to music
excellent product it wa very easy to install mpatible to all of our electronic equipment very user friendly ï ½ï ½ï ½ love that it it ha the voice feature on the remote

small and easy to use for child when traveling
great product for the price uld do away with the add but for what you pay they have to make some money somehow would give star if the add were not on this tablet factory ore loaded
i bought them for my kid for christmas they love them
my daughter love it she can make her video and listen to her music
bought for a gift for my girlfriend she love it she had the little fire this is like holding a flat screen very nice picture
this product need a bit more info to explain how it work and the set up it is all quite easy once we had a neighbor over to help and ro explain we are still exploring how this work for u but so far it is almost too good to be true especially with the price we are hooked on the night manager
having so much fun asking alexa all kind of question she is so smart
this is my send kindle fire and i would not be without one excellent little device for reading book and playing game use it daily to watch netflix
bought of these for christmas for my son one of them seems to be a bit better than the other one work a i would hope it would the other act a little hard if hearing i m speaking about the echo not my son alexa doe not always regnize her name and obey mmands
product is awesome amazing how i ask a question and in a few sends she ha the answer
i love this tablet primarily for reading it is inexpensive portable and light weight it ha great feature but it is on the slow side when browsing the web overall i m super happy with my purchase
wife had one for year she remmended one to a friend for her birthday and her husband purchased this one for her
this is one of the best purchase i have made in a long time i use the echo to ntrol my nest thermostat my light my sprinkler pretty much almost everything connected to my wink
this is a good product that ha great sound and is fun to have around the house wish the product worked more with some of the apps on my phone like napster
with a price tag of this is one of the low end tablet with a lot of feature but is certainly worth it price tag but it definitely lack the feature and hd display of it high end variant fire hd
i would remmend buying this worth the money for all you get
better than the fire stick crystal clear perfect gift for someone
every time i open my amazon fire game pop up it is very annoying i have no interest in game i do not play them i did not purchase the item for game i purchased my fire for reading book but it is very difficult to get to book i go through a number of minute and still do not acmplish the task that i want to do i would like to know how to take off the game so i can do what i want to do
decent product given the low price point got it for gifting and the kid enjoys it
friend who have amazon prime were delighted to have the amazon music library a well a all the other service at voice mmand with the amazon app on the smart phone they got shopping list and many other linked service it wa the best gift ever
i read review before making a decision for my purchase but ended up returning the device a i wa expecting an experience like that of an android tablet
bought this for reading but enjoy all the feature from book to movie
i cannot believe i bought this junk it is always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple time within a given hour none of the apps work properly i have tried to update the op system but that didnt help
these are excellent to keep on the ffee table or taking along on a trip cannot beat the price
love the speed voice search and ntent this product provides
too bad amazon turned this tablet into a big advertising tool many apps dont work and the camera is not good
i had some trouble after purchasing this had to reboot it a lot but since the last update it ha been working great
this is a great value for the money with amazon is apps for kid it ha been alot of fun and easy to use
expandable memory option wa a big plus k video output when streaming video is great and i wa able to load program to watch free movie and ppv
the thick edge make it easier to read than the voyage and pw very fast and responsive i wish the devise wa longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a cd case
this is a very good item and i would remmend highly
i bought my first kindle fire several year ago this year i bought a new one for everyone in my household great tablet lightweight i love that the newer kindle ha expandable memory
purchased one for our son and liked it so much that we bought one for ourselves it is very helpful in the kitchen for nversions timer and music my favorite is checking my mmute before i leave in the morning the only downside is i had to do a lot of research on the capability there wa no one stop shop learning new thing and like all gadget it is not necessary but fun to have
first time buyer of an amazon tablet and it wa a great decision very easy setup and my mom found it easier to use than the unit it replaced
so much better than my previous kindle i have used my new kindle daily and i m not much of a tech person it is light weight and easy to navigate the battery hold a good charge a well
bought for wife who is not into the techie word she like it suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it
work very well wa able to get it to work with my tablet and all our samsung phone easy to setup family app is with amazon prime
my wife asked me to get her an echo for mother is day and man am i proud i did she love it she get the weather report regularly and ask alexa a lot of question frequently i hear song she asks alexa to play what a fantastic machine
my grandson had taken over his mom is kindle she got year ago so we decided to get her a new one and she love it
i love the echo great sound quality so easy to use just amazing technology
only negative is pop up ad do not quite understand the need for ad
my year old destroyed an ipad mini this thing ha held up through drop throw and sticky finger awesome investment for road trip
roku is great i would remmend you can watch a bunch of movie
great kid tablet we have of them now and they me in handy on long road trip for the price they are a great buy
this is a great starter tablet doe all the basic thing and is only not gonna find a better one for this price in this price range your not gonna find a faster one get an sd card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet only gig of memory
i bought this so i can stream the playstation vue app and it work great very speedy and seems to be faster than the roku i would highly remmend this if you are trying to cut rds and want a set top box for streaming
this is better then the fire stick much faster streaming le lag
i love it use it daily for everything love the option and look
already had an echo dot so i knew what i wa getting rich sound with this full size speaker alexa very pleasant a usual
i like it better than ruko you can also install your own kodi apps
i got this to basically experiment with straight out of the box it is really not that impressive it is a novelty however a i checked out the skill available light started ming on literally echo is ability to integrate with home automation is excellent having voice mmands for turning on off light may seem like a novelty a well however there are endless option for the elderly or disabled with this little assistant and some customizing
i get this for my year old daughter is good basic tablet
good speaker hour battery good price excellent quality in how it is made
this is my send kindle paper white so i m very familiar with this product
buy this if you want to use playstation vue do not get the fire stick
great little tablet work very well for my daughter need
the screen is great and doe not strain your eye at all and page transition are smooth easy to buy book from amazon either on the device or a mputer and get them on the kindle instantly
i bought two of these one for my son and the other for nephew they love it i downloaded kidsmode on it and all their educational game they can play besides regular game
this tablet is the best i have seen for the screen is very readable which is more than i can say for anything else at this price
i wa always an ipad person but after having this i m fine with it it is easy to use and inexpensive
tablet is a good tablet not the best for game or apps but decent especially for the price
if your student you re going to love amazon tv i m a amazon prime member because i buy book from amazon all the time with this box you can also have the benefit of streaming movie with your membership
i cannot believe this came with the sd card slot this is by far the best amazon tablet purchased
syncing issue but once resolved alexa work fine becareful not to say alexa or echo too loud if you do not want her to answer make sure your question is clear the response is immediate it is amazing and freaky now we really do not have to recall anything because we can ask alexa
grandson love it he love to play game and watch movie
work well for beginner or a child great gaming tablet
ha worked very well with sling tv and other streaming apps
great sound for music easy to install and use alexa is good and quick with her answer i like the news brief in the morning
the amazon fire tv is definitely one of the top medium streamer on the market today it allows for k playback which only a few other device can do ethernet port to get the most reliable streaming speed and an expandable external storage port so you will have plenty of room for all of your apps if you are will to pay a little extra for this it is definitely going to be worth it in the end
had to chose between fire and fire for the money you cannot go wrong with the fire screen is good for older eye
initially wa purchasing this for my yr old nephew but after i received it i uld not part with it and bought him another cheaper brand
amazon product is good and it is handy it is useful while travelling
this wa a very nice unit and easy to use for kid good value
bought this a a gift for my mom and she love it the only downfall is there is no google play
alexa is great ntrols my home sings and give me weather and traffic alert find my phone and my other great thing

love using alexa for music and syncing her with hue to run the light but do not like how specific you must be with the way you ask her sometimes just cannot get the answer cause she want to be asked in a different way
very happy with product it is a miniature lap top
this is exactly the product we were looking for would remmend this anyone
i know there are other option out there including the fire stick but this box is great doe not lag at all unlike my apple tv last generation though i wanted to have a product based on android for the goody available and so far i m liking it a lot and it is k

this is a review of the kindle paperwhite launched july essentially the same a the previous kindle paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded dpi screen more memory and storage it is a terrific reading device this review aim to describe both this product and mpare it with the other kindle device available to help you choose the best one for you before i start ive noticed several mplains about kindle not supporting the epub format used by canadian public library dont be put off there a solution in the frequently asked question section below this review is broken up into section so you can skip the le interesting bit if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start and a frequently asked question section at the end summary what can you do with it read a book it can store is of book take an entire library away with you on holiday buy a book you can browse the amazon kindle store and buy book over a wifi connection borrow a book using the kindle owner library you can borrow one of book if you have amazon prime membership share your book using amazon family library to link two amazon acunts and four child and share your book with the entire family highlight a section using the touch screen you can highlight a particulary interesting few line if several people highlight the same section that is also indicated rerd a bookmark to me back to it later read a book on your kindle ntinue on your smartphone or tablet mputer and it will jump to your last known position look up a word and rerd them in the vocabulary builder track a character appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature read for week without needing to recharge typically week share you book multiple kindles on the same acunt or family sharing access every book you have ever owned on the cloud available for download within sends over wifi or g what device are available a of july amazon have the following kindle device on sale kindle around cdn kindle paperwhite th generation dpi launched october around cdn new kindle paperwhite th gen dpi launched july around cdn kindle voyger around u doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada kindle fire or lour tablet mputers at around cdn so you re faced with a few device plus additional option which to buy here is a quick summary in order of st the entry level kindle an entry level black and white e ink book reader it ha a inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousand of book and a battery which should last around week a terrific device to read book and a worthy ntender for the technically minded it ha a ghz processor and gb of memory with an e ink display essentially this mean it is a black and white b fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c requires very little power hence the battery last for week instead of hour new kindle paperwhite launched in this is really an upgrade adding a super sharp display with pixel per inch the same a the top of the range voyage the high resolution screen doe provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye but battery life is reduced from week of the original paperwhite to week but still a very long time mpared to the existing paperwhite it also includes double the memory which mean it faster and slicker than before and a new bookerly font plus better presentation of font on screen if you have an existing paperwhite it probably not worth upgrading however if you own a prior device youll notice the huge leap in screen quality ntrast and performance the voyage far more expensive that paperwhite this is thinner and g lighter it ha more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e reader body which make it look more like a tablet and keep dirt from getting caught in the edge the back ha a soft touch plastic finish which feel lovely in the hand and it ha new page press button on the side to turn the page when the button are pressed there a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch it ha gb of storage same a the paperwhite and a similar battery which should last around week on a single charge although it ha the same sharp dpi screen a the paperwhite the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting nditions this mean if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright in addition youll find when you switch off the room light your eye naturally beme accustomed to the darkness to mpensate the voyage automatically softens the light slightly a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device kindle fire tablet mputer the kindle fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindle range similar to the apple ipad mini it ha a high resolution screen a fast processor and lot of memory with a lour screen and a much shorter battery life hour rather than week although you can read book on a fire using the amazon kindle app youll find the kindle with it sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book youll find it produce le eye strain and whereas a tablet mputer is better suited to surfing the web watching video and reading email the kindle is a dedicated book reader device unlike a kindle the fire produce light at the blue end of the spectrum which mean it may make it harder for you to sleep the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back light which is far more suited to reading in bed and it wont for example wake your partner if reading in the dark finally unlike the rest of the kindle range the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while it fine for everyday use it le useful on holiday the kindle range of device are perfect to take away on holiday a they can carry thousand of book and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight what other option do i have having decided upon the model kindle paperwhite voyage or fire the next decision is around special offer ie advert g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with advert on a kindle they only appear on screen when the screen saver is on and are not at all distracting the g option is a more difficult question this effectively mean you can use your kindle to buy or download book over the air instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot personally i went for the wifi model a the saving is nsiderable but it a personal choice of urse if you wont have wifi at home then youll need the g option one point worth mentioning however is if you have a modern smartphone you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindle or indeed any other wifi device can connect to got to setting personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up and you can connect your wifi only kindle while youre out and about nclusion if you love book but your on a budget the original kindle with wifi and special offer is a great option youll still be able to carry thousand of book around with you but youll lose out on the soft white back light and super crisp display of the papwerwhite the kindle paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb dpi super sharp screen finally there the top of the range voyage with the page press button and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness if youre in the market for a tablet mputer then the kindle fire range is worth nsidering but youll get a better book reading experience on the kindle myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air i wa skeptical at first but the kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train and the back light and long battery life a huge bonus frequently asked question q what file format will a kindle reada kindle format azw kindle azw txt pdf unprotected mobi prc natively in addition to html doc docx jpeg gif png bmp through nversionq what

charger but the fire doe amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it some people also buy a ver but i think this is not really needed it add to the weight and is not really needed it will protect your kindle from a drop however and protect the screen if it left knocking around in a bag
i bought this for my four year old i have not given it to him yet but i m impressed how easy it is to use and how many apps are available for his age
it pretty ol a lot of teaching it thing but once you get it down easy from there i am able to ntrol the tv hue light and listen to music from any bluetooth device connected
did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value
alexa is fabulous just ask her anything and she will answer right away she can order a pizza turn on your light and order an uber better than a secretary
echo is a fun and useful product still learning all it can be used for
this tablet ha exceeded all of my expectation this wa purchased to replace a year old ipad mini and i uld not be happier this work great
initially we purchased the kid kindle fire for our year old the parental ntrols and time limitation are super easy to set up we have a samsung galaxy tablet that our year old son u but we ended up getting a send fire for him because it seemed very kid friendly and i didnhave to worry about any inappropriate ntent popping up lot of good educational apps and game
we have enjoyed this product especially during the holiday
great inexpensive item easy to use kid love to use it
i love how this one let you download apps the picture quality is also a i do find myself having to unplug it every day to make it start over or it ha trouble downloading especially with live tv apps a for it mpetitors i d say this is still the one to get i find myself having a lot more option with this one so my n are minor but still prevented me from a star rating i believe their next generation will be a tho like i said it is still the one with the most option available especially if you have prime the best thing about fire tv is it let is me download the direct tv app so i ditched my cable and just play live tv thru the app it is the same tv and i pay over a le a month now it is worth it just for that
my grandson love it he said his game do not freeze up on this one
easy to set up ha great sound nice to talk too
absolutely love it love the app store and the camera
this is a really good tablet for young kid to play on
i waited a while before going with amazon to start automating my home i had nsidered google home but since i wanted to have multiple room linked it wa much cheaper to go the echo route since the dot wa only each on sale it ha more after market apps and seems to be integrated into more home automation system light tv alarm system etc than google home it is also much sleeker and attractive to have sitting in your living room than google it is a bit of a novelty at the moment but is quickly beming an integral part of our house i wa a little disappointed in the pricing on sale since the echo dot a i mentioned wa only and doe everything the echo doe minus a better speaker the dot doe have a mm output jack so you can hook it up to a sound system or bluetooth speaker so if you do not use your echo to listen to music it wa a little overkill for the price
i wanted to buy it long time ago the price i bought in best buy is good for me of urse the quality is good
this kindle make for a great beginner tablet for a teenager the only mplaint is that it is a little laggy but great for the price
we have an echo in the kitchen and bedroom for listening to music and ntrolling our hue bulb if you re going to do any music definitely get this over the dot we have a dot too but in the office where we already have speaker
easy to use and setup good feature and apps are easy to download
ntrols everything in my home i would definitely buy it again
excellent ereader if that is all you are looking for probably a bit over priced for the casual reader the voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality
good beginner tablet for kid uld use a better resolution screen but overall it is good
video file transferring issue some file appear
this is the possibly the best tablet if you are an amazon store prime centric user but it doe not include the google play store and doe not include most any of the google apps which are stable in the tablet world no google inbox etc for me this tablet is a skip but it is cheap and if it meet your need you might love it
great device and deal specifically for the little one
it work great awesome device a great way to ditch your cable service provider
first bought it day before it went on sale everywhere next store doe not tell you about all the ad offer that me with it and you must pay to disable them performance is slow keypad is slow am typing faster than it can register resulting in lot of typo watching movie is decent but sound uld be better it drop wifi more than i m used to have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that nsistently crash good battery kifre but quite slow to recharge sometimes the key stick and cannot get out of something even with home key must restart thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my year old grandson i got worth of tablet mpared to the look and feel of my old ipad it like i m still using a vcr and everyone else is on blue ray
it a great tablet for child but it doesnt work with google apps
this is a great tablet for the money run fast and work seamlessly with amazon prime membership prime is not required to use this by the way you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment we havent tried to use this for business purpose though
my nephew love their new tablet great christmas gift
so far so good mpatible to my thing and very responsive way better the using siri lol still love apple
good deal and a great price wish the geek squad knew more about mbining kindle acunts
absolutely incredible a way better option then buying cable
th one i lose thing would not buy any other reader can read outdoors shuts off when i fall asleep reading save page
love it easy to use and efficient appropriate for any age
this is extremely easy to use packed with ability and ha internet capability i cannot believe all of this for such a low price this is the only tablet anyone need
very nice tablet work very well no issue nice video and excellentwireless wifi just a very smooth unit
good device my previous one wa inherited and ha a cracked screen
setup wa self explanatory it doe not take a genius i have had the echo alexa for nearly a month and love everything about it i have a rather large log home and decided to add the inexpensive smaller version called echo dot to the kitchen to be sure i uld turn the smart light on off dim without having to yell through the wall into the room where the echo alexa is located alexa did work the distance but i had to yell to penetrate through the wall for the light on the other side of the house a a team they both work like a charm there is so much still to disver about echo alexa echo dot and there have been more and more apps and accessory added to the list just in the short time i have had it love it and disver more and more thing about it a people are experimenting and posting thing about it online worth every penny
amazing use for many purpose ask alexa to set alarm play pandora and weather anytime well worth the money i use it even more than i anticipated
alexis is very useful for many different fun apps
fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not a impressed with it other potential capability more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do thing like get weather order item etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess
it is a little slow and the camera is not the best but for the price it is fine
i read often and love this e reader i previously had a nook and liked it but it wa old and did not have night reading option the voyage is light and easy to hold the backlighting is great at night overall very happy with this product for reading
i do not use echo a much a i thought i would or should i suppose but it is a nice accessory to have i have some trouble with it responding to my voice rrectly but overall it work well
love it great hd smooth streaming with sd card i have bought a gift and one for myself i like them so much
a friend had an amazon echo and my wife loved it i surprised her with one for her birthday she u it everyday for weather news and music great device and easy to use
i spent more time trying get it functioning than i did actually keeping this product after a uple of day and never getting it to understand or follow my mmands i returned it to bb also it kept trying to sell me product which i really didnâappreciate
i am enjoying the tap very much lot is to do and play with on the app still finding new thing it can do daily great sound quality to play my music i only wish that it had a better search engine
my alexa is the smartest she know a lot about everything it is amazing how quickly she can answer a question whether it is about math history a person or event etc even my husband is impressed played with my brother alexa for a uple week and ordered one for me she wa greeting me when i returned home love her

the echo is amazing and ha already changed how we enjoy our home from asking alexa to turn on the light in the morning to looking up the star of the movie that we are watching the echo is a valuable asset to our family i am going to purchase the dot and we just added a tap to mplete our smarthome
wish i had ordered another one so that i would not have to change it from room to room
my wife u this to read almost daily and she love it
everyday this thing get better great speaker quality and sound the ever growing list of mmands and function ensure lagging interest and usability

i love amazon fire tablet so i bought a tablet for each kid and they love it you cannot beat the price will differently buy more later on
my grandchild grabbed it and giggled i love anything that make a loved one happy

this remote is especially good for those who eyesight is weaker due to aging i got it a a gift for someone and it make searching for channel easier for the elderly

alexa is so much more than a gateway to amazon service we use the echo for music oking timer ntrolling the light of our home the best is when the kid add item to our alexa shopping list make it super easy to build a grocery list super easy to set up work great you should have one in your home
i bought this on black friday and i have been using it for about a month it is faster than my fire most likely due to the gb v gb ram the screen resolution is fine though not the best at this price i am not mplaining amazon add some nice feature a well the advertisement are discreet and only when the fire is turned on not a problem at all even at full price this is a good deal
i bought this for my husband to replace his original kindle the lighted background and light weight make it perfect for reading in bed the added feature of internet and numerous apps make it perfect for so many u it is easy to manage and the grandkids also love using it for the game it ha a great camera too overall very pleased
good product with great value remmend this to all
lot of option if you are a prime member you have a great selection of movie

this is simply the best and most tv for the money i should have cut the cable year ago
we bought two of these fire table online black friday we loaded google play and then our google acunts i still cannot believe they were only one of the most exceptional buy for christmas or ever very happy
besides surfing online making airfare hotel and rental car reservation is i am using banking online and able to make payment all my bill to a differents kind of business
all i can say it is awesome she wa watching movie on her phone now she watch them on her tablet
i love my amazon fire stick it go great with my tv
i have only had it for a few week so still have a lot of thing to learn but it wa incredibly simple to set up and figure out how to use it is pretty addictive too
wired internet connection is a little fast but still doesnt play higher resolution movie smoothly especially k i have mbps speed uld be due to slow server for the price and infrequent use i may just swap it for the cheaper firestick
such a great deal for a great product my year old mother love this
i have had both the kindle and the nook ereader they are similar in almost every way with one big difference amazon ha more ebooks available and they slightly cheaper plus then i bought the kindle it wa on sale for making it the same price a the nook
it is a good little tablet not the fastest thing but good enough for buck cannot mplain
would not be able to live without this box it ha never let me down
good starter unit easy for a beginner to use priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world
if you want a tablet for someone that is not the most tech savy look no further seriously it is the best buck you will spend
wa impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed including alex app fit in top at pocket
plugged everything in using a network cable instead of wifi and everything just work the box is responsive would be nice if the remote had tv volume option but that is a small nitpick very happy with the purchase it nfirmed my decision to be a rd cutter and drop directv
enjoy reading book on it a well a viewing video
uld not beat the price and the kindle fire is a nice tablet to have for reading playing game letting grandkids play on
this a great tablet for the parent who enjoy playing game
this wa a great gift for my son he wanted a reader for e book and wa delighted to have a tablet to search the web do e mail etc
it great i hooked my amazon prime up to it that is the best
had glitch and screen touch sensitivity issue with the previous kindle the basic kindle however this is definitely worth the st for an upgrade above it very user friendly and hassle free
better than i expect a and with alexander is magical
i have a connected home specifically smartthings this give me voice ntrol over everything and i love it the music is an added bonus i plan on purchasing more in the form of the echo dot for each room
i had wanted a kindle for a very long time when i saw the price i uld not resist
great for anyone who love to watch the latest movie tv show and much more
great option for watching tv without a cable subscription
this is a great tablet for kid it got great parental ntrols and it easy for the kid to use i even enjoy playing angry bird on it
bought the tap for my mom to primarily listen to music although my mom forgets the girl is name haha we have found alexa will answer without saying her name the rechargeable base is nice so the tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi sound is great too pleased
i love the product i m very happy but i would like even more if the page number wa displayed when reading book on this tablet in case i wanted to refer back to a certain page
this streamer box is very easy to set up it find the wifi quickly a nice and enjoyable addition to rd cutting
the bright screen and lightweight design make this ereader ideal for reading in just about any setting
i love this tablet because it is simple and portable easy to carry
we have tried a few different brand of tablet between the digiland tablet my neice ha or the polaroid tablet we bought last year do not buy polaroid the brand used to be about quality but their tablet are terrible slow unable to process much they needed to be restarted nstantly from freezing but amazon is fire tablet is amazing my mom wa so happy with it it run so well and is just overall awesome
new for tablet is some what different to use than the version bought these for gift
this is my third kindle the best differentiator is the form factor definite improvement over the paperwhite also like having the page turn button back case is very ol indeed if you can get past the jump in price remember you re not having to buy the case separately it is a quality product to have
own a firestick and didnlike the lag so i bought the fire tv problem solved super smooth fast responsive
i will rate this amazon tap a five star when the application to make the alexa mmands beme remote instead of manually pressing the mmand button on the unit itself
easy to use at home or lunch at the office the only problem i have is that you have to restart often great while using public transportation
this item is reading using it for reading and lite surfing

great for a good quality android tv box quadre bluetooth remote and will accept a bluetooth keyboard
with the amazon player you do not need satellite tv save you lot of money from cable or satellite mpanies

this tablet is a great value tablet in this price range usually end up failing quickly but this tablet ha held up perfectly for almost a year now the gb is somewhat small but adding an sd card ha helped with storage the lack of google play is a nuisance a the app selection is more limited but by adding aptoide i wa able to access many of the apps that are available in the play store but not amazon

i got the echo for christmas and hooked it up at my house hooked up all the automated wi fi device i had bought more just because they re fun and loved it then i decided i wanted a nice mpact music player for my office and started to evaluate option after reviewing and valuing based on my need my office and ease i decided to get another echo for the office the dot wa an option but the sound quality is not good enough for me while the echo is i m not a huge music aficionado just like clear music and it doe not require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up mputer resource to stream i got it hooked it up to the office wi fi and use it every day it give me the weather forecast traffic status miscellaneous information but most of all streaming music and when the phone ring i can pause it quickly using the voice ntrol and then resume when i m done that is what turned me away from the tap
it is a gb mini mputer and camera perfect for trip

i really like the large screen excellent graphic
the echo is an excellent product for listening to music and asking any question imaginable
it great just a little small then what i would like it have been
when i checked it online it said it had month of free subscription of the antivirus but there is nothing with my purchase i did read it said they will email me the download information but nothing in that part very disappointed i will only remmended to a friend if they have antivirus subscription at home

the kindle is great it is easy to set up and i have found all the book that i wanted
difficult to nvert music file from i tune to put on this device and that is why i purchased it take a lot of time to transfer file
i baught for my kid and figured that with the ver the the one year of freetime which includes all the video apps and game then it make sense i baught this one a a gift for a kid overseas and all the ntent is not playing when i contacted amazon they said it is not for overseas although i asked in best buy before i buy it and they assured me it work everywhere it is totally overpriced for a tablet that doe not play anything best buy should know and let customer know specially when u ask specifically
the speaker is a really great nvienence device however my only gripe is that the speaker sound warp at high volume if there is a lot of bass

although sonos speaker sound better this is not bad and at a cheaper price soon it is reported alexa will be able to ntrol your sonos system a well it also includes voice ntrol and provides skill which allow for home automation possibility in my mind well worth the price for the voice ntrolled audio feature and ha potential for many other u
not bad for an entry level tablet pretty much what i expected for the price i paid for it my four year old love it

i really like this product it is my first e reader my family ha had them but now that i have my own i love it it really look like you are reading a real page in a book and the backlight is what really make the difference for me it allows me to read anywhere even in the dark without worry about fumbling with a reading light although i love the feel of a real book and watching the bookmark go further through the page i am starting to get over that the nnivence of holding this instead of a book and also being able to have multiple book going at once without carrying a bunch of book with you is great i can fit this in my at pocket on the train while i mmute it is pretty small and now that i figured out how to borrow kindle book from my library via overdrive i save a ton of money by borrowing instead of paying for all my kindle book i definitely remmend this kindle paperwhite product the ppi screen is really nice and the price is very reasonable i uld not find any reason to buy the more expensive version called the voyage so my opinion is get this one

great for hooking up with pandora needed music in home a swapped out our receiver for a sound bar also from best buy

this amazon echo might be similar to that of siri and google however it make it fun to be able to ask it question no matter where you are at in the room it give precise weather update interesting traffic detail and even knowledgeable history lesson each morning with endless possibility this amazon echo is a step towards more interesting thing to me
alexa is handy and a lot smarter than i thought it would be i can also see it being used for homework for the answer and not the formula we cannot stop that nice addition to the living room

i love my kindle i did a lot of research and this wa the best option for me i do not regret buying it
i bought this for my mom and she love it she had been using a kindle in the past and needed something new
this product is fun but it doe not understand a lot of your question it is not a user friend item so it is limited to very few thing it can do for the money it need a lot of work i wa expecting more but it is a toy to have
i absolutely love this kindle fire it ha so many nice option and is small enough to carry when i go out great for game and email
very easy to use very fast good price would remmend this for a beginner
love this would buy so many time if i had more tv
the high resolution screen is noticeably easier to read and the user interface is well thought out
this is a good tablet kinda slow but what else do you expect from a cheap tablet
great if you do not care about the playstore for android it work fine to me
i have bought were for gift and everyone love the tablet
i wa looking for a bluetooth speaker to use to play amazon music and this product allows to to listen to music and do so much more if you have an amazon prime acunt you ll enjoy this product
i bought the fire for myself and it is user friendly we put some game on it about yr later for my daughter and she actually can navigate it pretty good so we bought her her own fire which she is proud to be able to listen to music and play simple game
this tablet is awesome for the price point read play game nsume medium surf the web and all for around buck it is easy to set up and easy to use nice camera and expandable memory round out the package
screen quality and size is good lightweight and good battery life
this wa given to me for my birthday and i love it
i love my kindle paperwhite it wa easy to set up and i have absolutely no mplaints i reviewed different e reader and decided on the paperweight because i uld read it outside with no issue i have tested it in the bright sun light and had no problem with any glare even with the sun shining directly on it
great product work perfect and connects with my logitech elite remote and ntrols music tv etc
it doe exactly what i bought it for and more worth every penny
looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet most of the one under were not worth purchasing i wa a little suspect when i saw the fire but having owned an amazon tablet before i decided to try it out i must say i wa impressed obviously it is a budget tablet so you are not getting a full hd screen or ipad like performance but it is also a th of the price it definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing facebook casual game and medium nsumption if your a prime member it is a great way to stream all of your amazon video show movie the build quality is much better then other tablet under and it is a multi touch screen not one of the plastic capacitive touch screen great tablet for kid grandparent people with light need or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream amazon video
my first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me easy to use and just the right size i use it when i just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top mputer very fast
this is such an improvement over the original kindle the page are easier to read in any light

this is one of the best product that someone ha me with i love it
bought this kindle for my grandson he love it and it very easy to use
this product is okay but doe not due what a normal tablet can due example social medium such a instagram and snapchat are not accessible on this tablet due to it being an amazon product had i known that i would not have purchased it
thank you great product for all age thank you
i bought the fire for my husband who is a senior citizen but doe not use a mputer he love it
santa brought it for our our grandson we got a shock case for it and he play and watch kid video on it every day while his older sibling are playing game on theirs it wa a little money well spent on a kid tablet
i have the apple tv in one room and this in the other both are great box but i must say this thing absolutely fly when watching amazon instant video almost zero buffering time even on k video
best bang for you buck tablet running android but without the google service if you have amazon prime then this will be great for your traveling need you can expand the memory with a memory card and the amazon app store ha plenty of apps
i like alexa device i am using this since one month this is future of mmunication
i have apple tv and this thing is way better i do have prime
bought this at best buy since i had a reward upon so only sent for this tablet short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and i kinda like amazon is new o running on this tablet better than android nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way category are on top and you can swipe right to view them a far a speed is ncern this tablet is good you can jump from apps with ease although installing new apps are a bit slower than on android the apps have installed are facebook linkedin overdrive cnn pandora pinterest skpe all run fine you can even run game on this device game like sky force real racing these game have high graphic run surprisingly smooth video on netflix hbo now pluto tv and youtube look great even though they are not hd sound is just ok my smartphone sound better and the display is good mpared to other cheap tablet on the market that are not ip battery life is good too can go a uple of day without charging with just reading book checking facebook surf the web and gaming already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all i not a prime member but purchase a lot from amazon so this device is nvenient when ordering book and other item this tablet ha been rock solid for the week i have it and it is still shocking to me regarding the price with no mpromise in quality wa going to buy the amazon fire hd but since my last amazon tablet wa lost this make more sense since it is at a price point where you can easily replace it amazon ha really changed the game with this tablet other is review that state that this is only for kid or beginner tablet owner is i disagree with now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market looking at you apple ipad and samsung then this is not for you but for others who need a device to do everyday task just like your smartphone then this is the one do not let the cheap price fool you

i really like the echo but i am still trying to find out what else it can do for me i do plan on getting the ntrollable light and thermostat down the road but in the mean time it is still limited overall great idea
amazon echo is simple to use and very easy to set up
bought this tablet for kid great price for what you get not a nice a the hd but price is right quick and responsive would remmend for anyone looking for a tablet for child use parent ntrols are a nice touch
more intelligent than siri however speaker performance is lacking when used for music sonos play or bose soundlink ha much better sound
wa skeptical about getting rid of cable love amazon fire so many choice and so much cheaper
my son ha always like the idea of a smart home while that is not in our future having alexa in his room make him feel like he can walk into his room and request music or have a question answered like he is sone sort of tony stark lol great buy

alexa wreck siri faster smarter and understands mplex question picture it this way who would you rather receive an answer from a high schooler or a pre schooler that is the difference no really when best buy put this on sale for grab one setup is cake it is got phenomenal wi fi reception and is really handy new skill basically third party plugins add functionality to the alexa product weekly if you have owned an ultra lame fire device do not be gun shy the echo rock the only caveat is the speaker is just good not great but good enough for room filling sound if you have you re own stereo system nsider the dot
my old kindle charger work fine that wa not clear when i bought a new kindle white and now you want to charge me to send it back forget it i ll keep the extra charger
i sometimes find the store a little intimidating and certainly overwhelming i do not always know what i want beforehand my existing surface failed in far to short a time frame and since i really only used it to read i wa able to replace it function with a kindle fire and i am actually much happier with it
good value at a very affordable price cannot beat it

i have been on the fence for quite some time about getting a dedicated e reader like many i didnwant to spend money and yet another device however review after review always mention that where the value in the kindle is in the distraction free reading experience and having finally purchased one i wholeheartedly agree with this a well the kindle paperwhite is light weight and is easy to carry around this is my first kindle since the nd gen and i m impressed by the speed and screen quality the lighting on the paperwhite is a huge benefit and is not at all distracting while reading

this fire tv is really awesome for viewing ntent the amazon video is really great and ha lot of ntent
it is wonderful i love it it is easy to watch movie play game and read book
i opted for the echo over the dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker and because i planned to add dot to my environment later to create a system of assistant the speaker sound is not great but it is not the worst i have heard i have also recently disvered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit the echo wa easy to set up and is really easy to use i especially like the ability to create a shopping list although i wish i uld create more than one list without adding apps and to easily integrate my google calendar i m currently exploring other feature and skill for the system some of which are very entertaining and useful one disappointment is the limitation of the near field voice regnition range alexa may be always listening but her ear do not seem to be very good if i m more than foot or one room away with not wall between u she usually doe not pick up my mmands that not withstanding she regnizes mmands very well and is very pleasant to interact with another issue i disvered is that in order for the echo to access your spotify music service at all you have to subscribe to the premium version i can understand that given the current propensity for most online service to find way to require you to subscribe to their premium service in order to really enjoy them however with amazon music you can access the free version and their premium amazon prime version in the area of smart home capability i purchased a philip hue starter kit with a hub and a uple of smart light and wa able to get them set up in the app very easily alexa doe a great job of ntrolling them for u but i am disappointed that the only place i can find additional bulb seems to be online where i have to pay for shipping in addition to tax apparently the retailer best buy walmart home depot etc have not seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantity were exhausted i ll be adding other device a time progress and expect to be pleased with the result
just starting to integrate it with other smart home product but it is already really useful
i purchased this item a a gift she love the tablet and u it every day
i have one and move it and i bought it for my year old niece and she love it work great
this is a good buy with the recent drop in price despite that i love how well it work the voice regnition of the echo is pretty good and i love the many question you can ask it and the response it give you
the kindle fire is a great value doing most of what more expensive tablet do for a great price
remmended every day great customer service also fast shipping
endless idea for u especially reminder to keep me out of trouble
i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because review more or le said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friend who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both model now have ppi so the dollar jump turn out pricey the voyage is page press is not always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you do not need auto light adjustment it is been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regret the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it is not hard to change the setting either a you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery wa on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about custom which i may have if i used a third party shipping service

this is my first paperwhite and i love it i have had a kindle keyboard loved it kindle fire wa okay kindle fire hd good for a tablet but i just love a good ol ereader for reading nothing else will do and this paperwhite is perfect to read in dark and bright situation plus the battery last forever
this is a great smart device for listening to music news or just finding fun fact there is so much that alexa doe to make life easier it take some time to get all of your presence set up but it is worth the effort we are so impressed with what alexa can do that we decided to get some of the security tool to pair with it
the fire tv k show great tv in k i also own firesticks and they are great also i purchased the fire tv basically for the k and i m not disappointed
the amazon fire is a great tablet with awesome graphic i use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issue with it

great item for the price reliable and work great
i bought this for my mom because she is too scared to even use her laptop i thought this looked more user friendly since she know my year old nephew can use an ipad
so happy with my purchase easy to setup and request information music and anything
had it for about year and would say it had good voice regnition and sound quality seemed to be functional and worked really well
amazing must have device get better with time a more and more skill are added able to listen to local sport radio music ntrolling your smart device etc great sound from the speaker a well
the entire family enjoys interacting with the echo it is a great way to organize shopping list we use the app on our phone to access the shopping list while out shopping the kid love all of the extra feature in addition to the music be sure to ask alexa to play it is raining ta
this ha been a great addition to our home we love using it to play music and getting general information
it is easy to use and we love it our grandkids find them very easy to use
just what my wife wa looking for in a tablet she wanted something to use to read to have some game on this wa it
love it working great on my ktv real easy to use
we have two amazon echo is and both work flawlessly easy to set up great for all around use nstantly add new feature
i have not hooked it up yet but i have herd nothing but great thing about it
i loved it not only wa the price good but gb of memory is phenomenal
easy to use easy to connect with cellphone and tablet to play youtube the product said it will upscale to k quality but the picture show on the tv is the same a regular product without k
we love this table for our y o it give him the sense of independence he want and me the sense of calmness knowing i can ntrol what he get on and how long he can spend in screen time
i purchased the amazon echo to use in the house and i have not been disappointed it play music give me weather and answer most question my family ha found it very handy to have around
this tablet is very great because it is not harsh on the eye when reading and the battery life is great i like to read a lot so it is perfect for that the touch screen work well too overall i m very satisfied with this purchase
whether you re a bookworm or a casual reader the kindle paperwhite is a great way to read and disver new and interesting book admittedly i only read infrequently since purchasing my kindle i absolutely love the size and ability of the kindle and have been reading book per month since purchasing it highly remmended
way easier than carrying a ton of book easy to read from and nvenient to use
love the fire tv super fast uploads small and mpact
i got this a a gift and i must say the sound is better than my bose speaker i not only listen to music but it turn my lamp on when i ask alexa also can give me the traffic report a well a weather she tell joke and many more thing i think everyone should have one of these
the kindle is great not only is it a reader it bascially a mputer it connects to the internet it take picture and ha many other great feature
i really like the echo but it doe take a long while to set it up also to utilize it fully you have to sign up for premium service for music etc
for the price you cannot go wrong if you re looking for something basic and do not want to spend a lot of money here is your tablet good for kid that will pretty much will ruin you re expensive ipad or something
this is fantastic we re finally tapping into the world of smart home however with all the different device brand and apps it make ntrolling all the device a little bit cumbersome so you can either get one brand and stick to it or you uld get this the amazon echo nsolidates and integrates all your device so now you can ntrol all your device regardless of the brand through the echo also the voice regnition is top notch
it broke so quick you get what you pay for honestly
i need a table that had more memory to start with this fit the bill i had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one this make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone
it is much faster than the firestick and much higher quality picture
now i am able to integrate my smart home device work like a charm alexa is still developing her skill but she is keeping me entertained job well done amazon
awesome tablet wonderful upgrade from the first kindle fire
i wa worried that it would have lag but it didni got this to replace my kindle paperwhite which i still love because i wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the book a well it is a great little tablet that doe so much of what i wanted it to do the stand by time and play time are better than i thought they would be a well i love the blue light filter although that take time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing the only other thing i really do not care for is the fact you can not easily add google play store
it a greatproduct halpy i bought and im happy to use it
my wife got this for her kindle book so she can read on the go
i do like alexa when asked a question and know the answer it is pretty neat the answer is immediate a well there have been many time where it did not know the answer maybe it didnunderstand the question i am looking forward to start getting some of the home connection to see how that work
i wish it wa a little smarter right out of the box most of the question i asked it at first it uld not answer do not call her stupid i did and she wa still listening and she told me she is still learning i actually started to feel bad i said it i told her i wa sorry and she forgave me for it my wife listens to music everyday and it sound great the built in mics can pick up your voice from just about anywhere in the room and you do not have to raise your voice after i did a little research and read up about all of the thing it can do i uld spend month is and still not use all of the feature
perfect for anything i need to do on a tablet watch movie play a few game surf the web work great and is much faster than my old samsung tablet

very easy to install great way to get the most benefit from amazon prime membership by watching movie and show so easy to use my yo can use it
this tablet wa inexpensive very lightweight and performs just a good a the more expensive one
at first when my husband bought this i fought more electronics to learn i now love using it especially when i am oking and i can saw echo add cinnamon to grocery list i also have many cam lighting that i can only say turn on uch one or two or fireplace light and not light up all cam the say play music is great it also tell joke and the recent news or weather we now have echo on two level of the house but do not worry he will add some to level soon lol

the echo is an amazing piece of tech it only rarely fails to understand what i m asking it and connects to virtually every smart piece of tech you own love it
good sound but unlike echo you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do i ordered a dot so this may solve that issue
i bought this for our family christmas gift and we are having fun asking alexa question i think we are ready for a uple of dot
we have two laptop and smart phone but love having the tablet to use instead of our phone
there are plenty of youtube video showing how to install kodi on fire device

with amazon prime i wa able to create a huge play list my echo also turn on light in some of the most innvenient area alexa keep me informed on news weather and sport

i purchased this simply for reading kindle book i wa able to get it with a reward certificate for it is biggest issue is glare more so in the sunlight i bought an anti glare screen protector and it made a huge difference but it is still difficult to read in the sun i m still very happy with the product
i am really enjoying this reader the light is adjustable for all type of lighting it is small enough to put in my purse to carry anywhere
the kindle voyage is the very best ereader that i have ever used the light is great and doe bother my eye in the the dark at all ipads fire and nook tablet bother me in dim light and extended reading while providing light read by the ntrols are simple and easy to learn however it is slightly pricey for me the quality and relief are well worth the price

i purchased the amazon fire tv after owning the roku for a year and after trying both the older and the newest version and apple tv i am a prime member so this seemed like a perfect choice however the remote is very unresponsive disnnecting more than it stay connected the menu layout is very ad centric and push you towards how amazon want you to view their service when the remote work the amazon tv seems sluggish in mparison to the other product i tried after several hour of fighting with the remote i decided to return it and get another roku possibly the version good try amazon but far from being close to either roku or apple tv
i bought this for a gift and the receiver love it it is so easy to read
very happy with the product very simple to set up easy on eye great option when you are on the road
i like the kindle the only thing is there is a little light fluctuation at the bottom of the screen
we purchased this tablet for my year old daughter to replace her rca tablet that lasted a year it is fabulous i m nsidering getting myself one for those long drive when your lap top is too big
again after some time i just use it for music like the google one i started out with but wa unhappy i wish it looked better since it is pretty ugly also the light are on the top so unless your standing next to it your not sure it is actually hearing you speak which can be frustrating from across the room needing to repeat your self over and over it it is better at answering random question then google
i have had one for about six month now an it is amazing so i had to buy another one for my baby girl an she love it also
i bought this intending to use it a a music and video player so i can save battery for my phone we got two one for me one for my child mine work perfectly for what i bought it all my music is on it with no problem i did have to download an app to play my wma file but that wa simple enough my child is tablet is primarily used for app game and i am told it is working just fine
i loved the variety of lors available for the tablet it is been dropped a few time and thankfully is still in tact with the exception of a few scratch my son love it
i have only had it for day now but have played game set up my email and figured out how to read book on it it seems very responsive and i have begun learning the all the finger move to run it
i had the st kindle but this one is much better
the amazon echo wa a easy setup the sound wa great and is worth the st
i bought this tablet for my yr son he love it it d the perfect size for him
best bang for the buck out there work fast easy on the wallet just an all around easy to understand and operate product
you need to have the fire tv to maximize your prime membership
i like the fire tv better than the firestick because the connecting the ethernet cable help with buffering
work well i would highly remmend better quality than others i have for phone etc so i only use this one now
i didnrealize what i wa missing alexa keep life in my home glad i invested in this product cannot wait to get home
amazon fire tv is great product wish the voice mmand option wa more user friendly

work smoothly when typing search info to google thing nstructed well the casing is solid and well made operation of this tablet is great
bought this for my niece for christmas she mostly u a ereader and checking email
i simply love it at first i thought reading black and white ntent on a ipad would be a similar experience and reading on ipad or iphone is similar and no need for kindle but kindle is different and for me it is better than reading a physical book it is so ol to carry around thousand of book at any time battery go on and on and on excellent piece of hardware
it worked fine however i returned everything a the kindle wa too small
the box is very fast and doe not have any buffering
this tablet is simply the best tablet you can buy in this price range easy to use decent battery yield good for occasional use i use it mainly to read news read email browse internet see movie on the go etc overall it a wonderful good quality product at an unbeatable price you cannot go wrong buying it
i bought this tablet for my daughter and she love it

no better tablet for the price amazon ntinues to produce excellent product
i bought this for my year old she liked it for the first few day and then she went back to playing with my ipad if i hadnalready introduce her to the ipad i think she would have been fine with this
i bought my fire tablet during the christmas sale season for a great price to replace my aging ipad i am really impressed with the speed of downloads and the quality of the video i added an inexpensive sd card to download video and show it is great for travel
very little storage amazon android skin bloated and too many ad
my child love this tablet it is fun and easy for them to use
the echo can help in so many way we use it for music shopping list and kitchen timer just to name a few of the many thing we use it for
i love my echo i know that some of you will be saying what do i really need this for but once you have it you will use it and love it

i bought a a gift for my mom she love it it is easy to use she cannotake photo watch movie browse internet
i personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight so easy to handle for my toddler with the increased number of game and apps downloaded on the tablett it slows down in speed that for sure i dislike but over al it is good to have when on the go on car ride or long period of waiting
we bought this for our son and he love it he can read his book and also play game on it
we wanted an inexpensive tablet for our year old and this one is perfect he can use it to read book and play game and it wa very affordable

old kindle broke i love the improvement of the paperwhite it is all touch screen the old wa not
simple to set up my husband is not tech savvy and this wa easy for him to set up
i m a huge fan of these tablet if you are not trying to spend a lot of money or if you are not an avid daily user this will easily do all the basic necessity
seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it the main user is nearly four year old happy with it and get excited when using it
bought for my wife for mother day a she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer and it performs amazingly in that respect we have ipads and regular kindle fire unit the kid but only this one can be read in any light any time of day only star a i m not sure why terribly more expensive than the fire unit but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool uld not be clearer
